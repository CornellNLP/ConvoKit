Here is a trajectory summary of a conversation that lays out how the dynamics of the conversation developed. You need to parse the summary into events in order. 
Follow the following guidelines:
1. Try to maintain the original language of the summary as much as you can. 
2. Provide your output as a Python dictionary with the following structure:
_(Note: Do NOT use markdown, JSON formatting, or code block delimiters.)_ 
{{
    '0': "" // description of the event
    '1': ...
    ...
}}
