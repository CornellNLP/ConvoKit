Die von mir zitierten Quellen, wo Funi für anderes als \\'\\'Schlittenseilbahn\\'\\' verwendet wird, sind als hochdeutsch zu werten, weil der Begriff dort nirgends in Anführungszeichen auftaucht und der restliche Text nicht auf Schweizerdeutsch geschriebene ist.\\n:\\'\\'Funi\\'\\' ist trotzdem ein Helvetismus, auch wenn es nicht der Standardausdruck ist, denn das ist kein Kriterimu für \\'\\'Helvetismus\\'\\'.

    "Write a short summary capturing the trajectory of a Wikipedia talk-page discussion. Do not include specific article content, titles, policy names, diffs/edits, quotes, or concrete claims. The style you should avoid is illustrated in Example Sentence 1: “Speaker1 insisted an article include a particular detail and cited a specific policy by name. Speaker2 countered with a different policy and argued that the section should be removed. Speaker3 referenced a prior version and proposed a precise rewrite.” Instead, you should include indicators of sentiments (e.g., sarcasm, politeness, frustration), intentions (e.g., agreement, disagreement, rebuttal, concession, clarification, accusation), and strategies (e.g., consensus attempts, moderation, revert-restore cycles, rhetorical questions, appeals to emotion). The following sentences demonstrate the style you should follow: Example Sentence 2: “Both speakers hold differing views and become defensive. Speaker1 diminishes the weight of Speaker2’s reasoning, and Speaker2 blames Speaker1 for an uncivil tone. Both accuse each other of focusing on personal traits rather than reasoning.” Example Sentence 3: “The speakers refute each other with back-and-forth accusations. Persistent fault-finding and critical stances escalate tension and hinder productive discussion.” Overall, the trajectory summary should capture the key moments where the discussion’s tone or coordination changes. Here is an example of a complete trajectory summary: Multiple speakers discuss possible changes. Several present differing stances in sequence, building on and contesting each other’s reasoning. Speaker1 disputes a point from Speaker2, prompting a rebuttal. Speaker3 supports Speaker1, after which Speaker2 defends their position. Later, a speaker references a removed remark and offers an extended counter. Despite friction, the tone remains mostly civil with attempts at consensus. Now, provide the trajectory summary for the following conversation. Conversation Transcript: {transcript}. Now, summarize this conversation. Remember, do not include specific topics, claims, policies, or edits. Instead, capture the speakers’ sentiments, intentions, and strategies. Limit the trajectory summary to 80 words.
