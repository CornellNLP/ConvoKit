    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates an application of the Expected Context Framework to analyze question periods in the British House of Commons. We will principally use the framework to derive a typology of questions based on their rhetorical role; later in the notebook, we'll explore some other properties that the framework derives. \n",

    "An earlier version of the method is implemented via the `PromptTypes` module in ConvoKit, and is demoed [here](https://github.com/CornellNLP/ConvoKit/blob/master/examples/prompt-types/prompt-type-demo.ipynb). That version, and more details on the dataset, are found in [this paper](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Asking_too_much.html). Details about the Expected Context Framework, and the extended analyses presented below, can be found in [this dissertation](https://tisjune.github.io/research/dissertation)."

In that spirit of cross - party consensus on higher education , will he join me in supporting all those engaged in the study and teaching of disciplines that greatly stimulate and develop the mind , but which do not have an immediate vocational application ? May I also ask him finally to dissociate himself and his party from the remarks of the former Secretary of State , who deprecated the study of taxpayer - funded history ? [ Interruption . ] Medieval history or any other type of history .

Will the Minister also encourage extra funding for the excellent Pontardawe music festival , which will be attended by 20,000 people on the weekend of 16 to 18 August but receives a derisory Arts Council grant of just £ 1,275 , which would not even buy four seats in a box at Covent Garden ?

Does he share my disappointment that certain organisations characterised the Buenos Aires conference as an agenda for inaction ? In the context of the question asked by the hon Member for Nottingham , South ( Mr. Simpson ) , how can certain developed countries be prevented from escaping their obligations through some clever footwork ?

Will he join me in the delegation going to see the Treastury about corporation tax and will he give his full support to exemption from corporation tax for the British Olympic Association so as to ensure that the money raised by voluntary effort for the Olympics can be spent on that and not given back to the Government ?\n",

Women whose children have been shot and killed have taken the very brave step of publicly standing up to condemn the violence in their communities ; they are trying to change the culture where young men are prepared to use firearms .

The Minister , as a Sheffield United supporter , knows a bit about football . John Charles of Leeds United and Wales was never sent off or booked in his career .

Such arrangements will be kept under constant review . Much depends on the response of the individuals concerned , but perhaps I can give the hon Gentleman the assurance that , in any event , there is no question of groups of paedophiles being housed together at Wing Grange , nor of any one paedophile being housed there indefinitely .

The allocation in my constituency is about the same as in his constituency , and I have long worried that things like age and rurality are not factored into the final amounts in the way that they need to be . However , in this case NHS England decided that if it was to follow precisely the ACRA recommendations , it would lead to higher growth for areas with better health outcomes and lower growth , or even cuts , for areas with less good outcomes , which it thought would be inconsistent with its responsibility to reduce health inequalities . That is why it is conducting a fundamental review , which it says it hopes will inform the next set of allocations for 2013 - 14 .\n",

      "> 1986-05-13a.550.10 0.169 Does my right hon Friend agree that , as defence costs rise , there will inevitably in due course be a need to review commitments ? If commitments are to be reviewed , does he agree that that which is least consistent with fair burden - sharing among the NATO allies is the maintenance of 55,000 troops and a tactical air force in Germany ?\n",

      ">> 1985-01-17a.499.3 0.191 I agree with everything that my hon Friend has said . Indeed , the NFU 's \" Send a million tonnes of wheat to Africa \" campaign is to be warmly welcomed . With regard to my hon Friend 's first point , it is certainly true that surpluses can erode quite rapidly in very bad years . Nevertheless , we face a substantial surplus this year . The important point about food aid or any cereal exports is that it is cheaper to export direct from the open market than through intervention . That is a very important point in connection with our policy on intervention .\n",
      ">> 2002-07-23.843.3 0.202 I understand and agree with my hon Friend 's desire for a much stronger external policy for the European Union . It is important , however , that , in the absence of that , we all make every effort to try to crack this problem . The Danish presidency is seized of the need to engage on this matter , and the European Commission is in weekly discussion on Kaliningrad on behalf of the whole of Europe .\n",
      ">> 1990-07-10a.162.8 0.203 I entirely agree with my hon Friend . What is more , our new policy for grant - maintained status is proving popular . The number of grant - maintained schools in operation this coming September will be double that of last September . It is clear that parents are opting for grant - maintained schools as applications for places are up by 40 per cent . , so it is also clear that parents , governors , head teachers and teachers like grant - maintained schools . Only the Opposition reject that extended opportunity for parental choice . I suspect that , as with so many of their other policies , they will think again in due course .\n",
      ">> 1991-01-29a.776.6 0.205 I agree with my hon Friend . It is important to take advantage of the situation , even though it is rather grave on the tourism front because of the impact of the Gulf war . The promotional efforts to which he referred are important and there is a real challenge to encourage home tourists to make more use of facilities here . The timing of the promotion is of the essence , but it is for the industry , in conjunction with the British tourist authorities , to decide how to do it .\n",
      ">> 2002-04-10.18.0 0.212 My hon Friend 's point is right . Saddam Hussein is in defiance of the resolutions with which he should comply . However , he has the opportunity to comply with them now . He is not in doubt about what is necessary . The United Nations resolutions are clear ; there are nine and he is in breach of every one . The international community 's position is also clear . Whatever people think about the action that will follow , he must comply with the resolutions . To that extent , I entirely agree with my hon Friend .\n",
      ">> 1996-11-28a.447.2 0.214 I agree entirely . Even when the other continental countries achieve better rates of economic growth , their experience tends to be that that growth does not create jobs as it does in this country . That is because they are over - regulated , they have inflexible labour markets and the costs of employment are far too high . It is therefore extremely important that we should repudiate the social chapter . That sentiment is shared by large numbers of German , French , Dutch and other industrialists . It is quite extraordinary that the British Labour party continues to advocate a turn towards that approach to employment , when the business community in the rest of the continent is hoping to get away from it .\n",
      ">> 1986-10-22a.1164.4 0.214 I agree that it would be desirable to make a statement . However , it is open to the EIS to determine its timetable in the light of the information that it feels it needs to know before deciding on the recommendation to make to its members .\n",
      ">> 1985-12-05a.412.8 0.216 The hon Gentleman seems to suppose that I send people to prison . I do not send people to prison . The courts send people to prison , having listened to the evidence . For serious cases it is right that there should be serious sentences , which often means custodial sentences . I agree with the hon Gentleman to the extent that for the less serious cases the courts should look carefully at alternatives before awarding custodial sentences .\n",
      ">> 1989-05-10a.857.1 0.217 I agree with both my hon Friend 's points . In particular , on his latter point , it is surely right that we in the United Kingdom and the EC should try to establish trading and other relations with the countries that are making progress and respond to that progress as it develops .\n",
      ">> 1987-11-10a.148.5 0.222 I agree with the hon Gentleman 's second point . As for his first question , the objective of all the negotiations and of the agreement that we very much hope is about to be signed is to reduce the number of nuclear warheads in Europe . I am convinced that the agreement will achieve that aim . When that has happened we shall have to make sure that our remaining armaments are credible and that they hold together as a coherent weapons system .\n",

The NHS keeps detailed records on every patient who is subjected to compulsory treatment of whatever kind , but she is absolutely right to say that , as we give patients access to psychological therapies often at a much earlier stage in the development of mental health problems , it is likely—this would be of great benefit to those patients and their families—that we can avoid the need for more acute treatment , and particularly compulsory treatment , further down the line .\n",

The United Kingdom 's anti - corruption legislation is among the most comprehensive in the world and we are working within the Organisation for Economic Co - operation and Development and the European Union to ensure that our major overseas competitors enact similar legislation .

We have highlighted to our posts around the world the key commitments in the human trafficking strategy that they can help to deliver . Those include engaging with foreign Governments to ensure that common challenges are identified , and encouraging them to work with us to address those challenges . We have asked each of our posts to identify a single point of contact on human trafficking , and we are working in consultation with colleagues across government and with non - governmental organisations to bring together all the work that is already going on , including on the specific local challenges in each country .

I was assured that it had not . Indeed , the system was working very well and at least 94 per cent . of calls got through first time , which is a good record for any call centre , whether in the public or private sector .

Of course , there are systems of parole whereby some people may be released before they have served their full sentence , but it is wrong for my hon Friend to suggest that in all cases of murder the offender will serve about 12 years . The advantage of the mandatory life sentence for murder , with discretionary release at the end , is that it can cover a great many gradations of murder .

Therefore , the only way to have a truly comparable figure is to take owner - occupier housing out , which is what I did , and that is a very different comparison between the 6 per cent . and the 4¼ per cent .

We have £ 25 million for the science enterprise challenge and £ 20 million for the reach out fund , as well as funds for the SMART schemes and the foresight - link awards to foster engineering .

      "> 1985-12-11a.907.6 0.298 Is the Secretary of State aware that it might do him a whole lot of good to visit Gartcosh , if only because a change of company might be helpful ? Is he aware also that if he ever meets the men and women of Gartcosh he will find that they are people who say what they mean and mean what they say ? They would never be a party to the disgraceful betrayal which we witnessed in the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs this morning , which was a contribution to the pantomime season and a disgrace to Scotland ? Will he accept that the men and women of Gartcosh believe that they have a future and that Ravenscraig has a future and that Scottish Members are determined to fight for that future , in the knowledge that they have the overwhelming support of the Scottish people ?\n",
      "> 1989-10-19a.259.3 0.312 Does the Chancellor recognise that since the last quota increase the growth in the world economy and the emergence of the international debt problem on their own justify a larger rate of increase than the Government are willing to support ? Does he accept that historically important changes are taking place in eastern Europe , the success of which will depend on the economic progress of the countries concerned ? Would it not be tragic if this unique opportunity , from which we have so much to gain in the West , were missed because we starved the IMF of the resources that it needs to play a constructive role ?\n",
      "> 1986-04-29a.773.8 0.313 Will the Minister accept that the Government 's proposals could inflict gratuitous extra hardship on some of the most severely disabled people in this country , and could force them into the sort of subhuman existence that Granada 's \" World in Action \" documentary so strikingly exposed last night ? Is he prepared to consider an as - of - right community care addition to meet the additional requirements of disabled people ? Would it not be self - defeating as well as inhumane not to do so ?\n",

The town will have , on one side , the Thames tunnel of the channel tunnel rail link and , on the other , Ebbsfleet international station . During the construction of those large projects , heavy goods vehicles will rumble through the town , as there is currently no other route for them . Does my hon Friend accept that the people of Northfleet are fed up to the back teeth with Kent county council , which has delayed the introduction of the project ? Two years after the public exhibition , the council is now involved in an inspector 's inquiry . Will my hon . Friend give an assurance that , as and when Kent county council does its work properly , he will ensure that the inquiry is carried out as fast as possible ?\n",

We negotiate limits on Japanese imports , which will allow in more EEC imports , but will the Minister accept any responsibility for the existence of the British motor industry ? We are investing in the motor industry and seeking to build it up , but would it not be wise to negotiate import ceilings on EEC imports in the same way as we do with Japan , regardless of what the Treaty of Rome says ?\n",
      "> 2016-02-29c.666.1 0.320 Does my right hon Friend accept that by advancing the rather quaint idea that somehow our membership of the EU enhances our national security , he is merely playing into the hands of people such as Mr Juncker and Chancellor Merkel who , if Britain votes to remain in the EU , would advance towards a European army and permanent structured co - operation , the result of which would be to undermine NATO—the very organisation that the Secretary of State says is the cornerstone of our national defence ?\n",

When that day comes , will it not be necessary to ensure that the people concerned have a proper trial ? Is my hon Friend aware that nothing will convince me that those who have escaped from the Maze prison have not struck and killed again ?\n",
      "> 1988-03-14a.856.2 0.325 Does the Minister accept that it is very difficult to target aid at poverty in Third - world countries when we still have not resolved the problem of international debt ? Bearing in mind what he said about the World Bank , does he accept that many African countries see the World Bank and its demands as part of their problems rather than as a solution to them ? Would it not be better for the bank to come up with a strategy of debt relief instead of dealing with default in the interests of its own credit rating ?\n",

      ">> 1997-11-26a.959.0 0.446 I thank the hon and learned Gentleman for his question . Different parties have different parts that they consider to be essential to some sort of final accommodation—these include devolution in terms of an assembly , cross - border co - operation and the nature of the powers of that body . Surely , the point of negotiation and discussion is to consider the basic tenets that each party brings with it , whether it be cross - border co - operation , a devolved assembly or a change in east - west relations . That is what discussion , debate and negotiation should be about . I hope that the hon and learned Gentleman finds it within himself to join those talks in the future , because his contribution would be welcome .\n",
      ">> 1998-02-17a.891.7 0.472 The hon Gentleman knows that my hon Friend the Financial Secretary announced the proposal well in advance of any Budget determination , precisely so that the professions could be consulted , and so that any representations made about the effects of the proposal could be considered . The hon Gentleman is surely aware that such representations have been made , and I am sure that my hon Friend will take them into account .\n",
      ">> 1994-12-19a.1390.2 0.474 I understand that what has persuaded the hon Gentleman 's colleagues and others who are members of the Accommodation and Works Committee to make access for disabled people—it is not available for other members of the public—via Carriage Gates is the practical difficulty of providing good access for the disabled through St. Stephen 's entrance , for the very reason that he has given . If the hon Gentleman has thought of a solution to the problem , I suggest that he directs it to the members of the Accommodation and Works Committee .\n",
      ">> 2007-10-25b.398.2 0.483 I am grateful to my hon Friend for that question , but I am sorry to have to tell him that , because of the lack of agreement on suitable controls and standards , the Environment Agency and the industry have not been able to produce a protocol . However , it is not all bad news and we hope that the industry itself will make further progress on protocols . The Environment Agency issued new guidance on 3 October , confirming the deregulation of virgin timber . That means that producers will be able to recover and sell on virgin waste wood , such as off - cuts , shavings and sawdust and , of course , the production that comes from the management of forests . Those will be free from regulatory control . Clean and treated non - virgin timber will remain classified as waste and regulated as normal through exemptions and waste legislation .\n",
      ">> 1997-11-18a.142.1 0.486 I can only assume that that is a deliberate misrepresentation of the Government 's position . The hon Lady is surely aware of the road schemes that we have announced and I am sure that she appreciates that we are carrying out a thorough review of the trunk road programme , as we promised during the general election .\n",
      ">> 2006-03-06b.600.5 0.489 I am grateful to my hon Friend . He goes back to 1807 ; shortly , we will have a question that relates to the next century—the Church certainly has a wide span . He will note that the Synod recently called on Her Majesty 's Government to give the highest priority to enabling legislation to bring an end to the causes and outcomes of slavery . Personally , I presume that the Synod will equally accept the enabling legislation for the Church to accept women bishops in line with his ten - minute Bill .\n",
      ">> 1997-06-10a.931.5 0.489 I can only repeat that , while we make it clear that the human rights dimension is an important part of the way in which we shall consider applications for export licences , the review announced by my right hon Friend the Foreign Secretary has not yet been completed , although it will be completed very rapidly . Until that time , it would be foolish for us to make any further comment .\n",
      ">> 2005-03-02a.942.5 0.491 I am not surprised at anything that the Tories do in my hon Friend 's council . When we came to power in 1997 , the Tories left a shameful legacy of child poverty . The problems of poverty and social exclusion across Wales and the huge gap between the rich and the poor were evident to everybody . It is important that we continue this Government 's commitment to investing in education and overcoming the problems of child poverty . One child in three in Wales lived in a low - income household when the Conservatives were in government ; they will never be in government again to damage and harm our people , as they did in the past .\n",
      ">> 2007-11-28b.280.2 0.493 That is not , I believe , what Baroness Jay said , but the hon Gentleman 's question will be a matter for the inquiry , which will examine all issues relating to this matter . Surely the right thing to do when a problem arises is to investigate it in detail , deal with it , change the procedures if necessary and , if necessary , reform political party funding—which we are prepared to do .\n",
      ">> 1994-01-17a.518.5 0.493 As I have said , approximately £ 12 million is available for such measures in the current year . I understand that the specific case of Coedely is a matter for the Welsh Development Agency , for the hon Gentleman 's local authority of Taff Ely borough council and for Mid - Glamorgan county council , which are giving it the most serious consideration and are ensuring that appropriate arrangements are in hand . I remind him that , under the first programme for the valleys , 2,600 acres throughout the valleys of south Wales have been cleared—a record which can compare with the best in Europe .\n",

Our military stabilisation and security teams , which performed so admirably after the Indonesian earthquake , remain to be dispatched to Haiti . Will he consider those assets ?\n",

May I ask my right hon Friend the Secretary of State to pass on my welcome to my two colleagues who have joined him on the Front Bench ? Food and food production are far too important to be left entirely to the advocacy of Members with rural constituencies . They are of importance to everyone . I noted my right hon Friend 's response to the hon Member for Lancaster and Wyre ( Mr. Wallace ) . Will he consider approaching the Office of Fair Trading and pressing it for its view on what is competitive in the dairy market ? That would allow it to take a more pragmatic approach when mergers and changes happen in the co - operative sector .\n",
      "> 1999-07-13a.157.1 0.387 Could the Minister give an assurance that he will pay particular attention in his review to applications for sites within areas of outstanding natural beauty , including the Chiltern hills ? Will he take careful account of the reports that pressure is being exerted to overturn the decision of the local planning authority on Chisleys wood in my constituency ? That pressure is coming from Government Departments and the current tenant of Chequers . Will he ensure that he takes all steps within his Department to avoid any conflict of interest in determining the outcome ?\n",
      "> 2007-07-11b.1458.1 0.389 I warmly welcome the Prime Minister 's statement , which contrasted with the churlish Punch - and - Judy effort from the Leader of the Opposition . I suspect that parliamentarians throughout the House will welcome my right hon Friend 's comments today . Will he examine the relationship between Parliament and the Executive ? Government and Parliament are stronger in partnership than when one dominates the other . In that context , will he ensure that all Bills are introduced in draft , so that the House can discuss them properly ? Will he also ensure the fullest pre - legislative scrutiny ? If we have that , we will end up with better law and better government .\n",

He has just received a letter from his solicitor telling him that it will be not months but years before he receives his full compensation .

May I also ask him personally to take the question of compensation by the scruff of the neck , and deliver justice to the miners ?\n",

Bearing in mind the work that my right hon Friend the Secretary of State has been doing along with others in the north - west , will my hon Friend consider carefully the fantastic successes in industrial biotechnology in the north west and urge the Government to inject more support into the projects going to our academic institutions there , thus helping our industrial partners ?\n",

Will the Minister consider taking action to ensure that drivers in Westminster , where we all walk around all the time , do not sit in their cars creating emissions and polluting the atmosphere ? As a start , will she ensure that all Government Departments instruct Government drivers to switch off their engines in such circumstances , which they currently fail to do within the Palace of Westminster and in the streets of Westminster ?\n",
      "> 2014-06-12c.677.0 0.399 I am grateful to the Secretary of State for that reply . Will he ensure that , in addition to that scientific examination , he also meets with the Welsh Assembly Minister who is dealing with this matter in Wales—not too far from his own constituency—where an alternative method of vaccination is being undertaken ? Will the Secretary of State agree to evaluate that as part of the process as well ?\n",
      "> 2001-06-26.502.0 0.401 I am disappointed that it is not the Secretary of State at the Dispatch Box . Labour 's NHS plan states that the Government are in favour of a new pay system for the NHS , and figures published today detail the pay received by the service 's humble and self - effacing nurses . They show that general nurses get about two thirds of what is paid for agency work , while a theatre - registered general nurse gets paid about half the rate for an agency job . Is it the Government 's plan to bring the pay of people who work for the national health service up to the levels available outside , so that they will not leave the service and work elsewhere ? If so , will he ensure that all those working for the NHS come within the pay review body structure ? Above all , will he ensure that ambulance personnel receive the sort of pay that people who save lives every day deserve ?\n",

We have removed much of it from the catering department , but not all of it . However , Members ’ offices are still supplied with plastic envelopes that are not recyclable or biodegradable .

    "One interesting thing to point out is that among questions asked by government affiliated members, aggressive (e.g., **demand for account**) questions tend to be asked more by older askers (indicated by blue dots) -- that is, it seems that as parliamentarians get more tenured, they ask more aggressive questions. Note that the ministers answering these questions are almost always affiliated with the government, so this means that older askers are more aggressive, even towards members of their own party. In [this dissertation](https://tisjune.github.io/research/dissertation) we more carefully examine this observation."

      "> 1992-02-05a.280.6 0.072 I entirely agree with my hon Friend . The House will know that 46 British inspectors have been involved in the process of inspection within Iraq . Certainly I pay tribute to them and to their colleagues from other countries . On the second part of my hon Friend 's question , yes , it is important to enhance the verification and inspection powers of IAEA. I hope that we shall succeed in doing that , especially with regard to special inspections of previously undeclared sites .\n",
      "> 1990-12-11a.802.0 0.077 The hon Gentleman is absolutely right and I welcome his support . His party is not renowned for its determination to stand up to proposals emanating from the European Commission . I hope that we can derive some confidence from his words that the Liberal Democrats will agree with our efforts , supported by the CBI and other organisations , to resist those extremely damaging proposals .\n",
      "> 2005-12-05b.599.0 0.080 I entirely agree with my hon Friend and I congratulate those who have been doing that work in his area . Where work has been done through the alcohol misuse enforcement campaign to clamp down on alcohol - related crime , the result has been a significant reduction in such crime . However , he is right to say that there should be no tolerance of organisations that repeatedly sell to under - age drinkers . I support the full use of the powers that we have given police forces and others to clamp down on the sort of morally unacceptable behaviour to which he has drawn our attention .\n",
      "> 2013-02-25b.14.6 0.081 I agree with my hon Friend that that is extremely important . I believe that we will do what he asks , and if we do not , I am sure he will bring it to our attention . Since I first went to the Ministry of Defence nearly three years ago , he has been a doughty exponent of the need for the development of commercial and residential estates on old MOD sites . I pay tribute to him for his work on behalf of his constituents .\n",
      "> 2008-02-05b.773.1 0.086 On the first point , my hon Friend is right about some sluggishness in PCTs in commissioning these services . That is why we have made it a tier 2 issue in the operating framework this year and increased funding by 11 per cent . On the second point , I pay tribute to the work that she too has done on fluoridation over the years . I entirely agree , as do the British Medical Association , the British Dental Association and every reputable scientist who has considered it , that extending fluoridation is the best way to close health inequalities .\n",
      "> 2012-01-25a.286.2 0.088 Yes , I most certainly do—2012 is the year to visit Northern Ireland , with the launch of “ Your Time , Our Place ” last week , before returning in 2013 for the UK city of culture . I pay tribute to my hon Friend for his sterling work in encouraging Members to donate to his window to commemorate Her Majesty ’s diamond jubilee . I did a quick ring - round of the Northern Ireland Office , and I am glad to say that I have donated—although I have not told my wife—the Secretary of State has donated and our Minister in the Lords has donated .\n",
      "> 1998-06-15a.15.6 0.088 My hon Friend is right . However , as we saw when I visited his constituency , the process can not be easy or immediate . There needs to be a commitment on the part of police and local authorities ; they need to win the support of the local community , and they need to listen to members of that community , who best know the type of crime that spoils their lives . A commitment to such a partnership , and to cutting crime , is essential , and I congratulate my hon Friend on the way in which he is encouraging that in his constituency .\n",
      "> 2009-12-16b.959.5 0.088 I congratulate the Daily Record on its campaign against loan - sharking . It is important that we inform everybody that Government - funded money advice centres are there to help people , that in all areas there are loan - sharking investigation teams and that people can look to their credit unions for help . For many families , there is a lot of pressure at Christmas , so they should take advice and use credit unions .\n",
      "> 2007-01-10b.267.1 0.089 I warmly welcome the hon Gentleman 's remarks about David Ervine—and he is right to raise organised criminal activity , which underpins the remaining paramilitary activity in Northern Ireland and occupies my mind very much . We have the Organised Crime Task Force in Northern Ireland , which is doing a good job of bearing down on the problem . I am sure that the whole House will unite in the quest to ensure that organised criminal activity in Northern Ireland is eradicated .\n",
      "> 2004-03-09.1367.1 0.089 Yes , I do . There are opportunities for all kinds of imaginative ways of running the railways better . Often , local circumstances dictate how best the railway should be run in that area , and a great deal can be done to tap the creative potential that is there to provide better service for customers .\n",

      ">> 1996-04-24a.431.7 0.162 Does my hon Friend agree that , if multi - culturalism is about defending the rights of people of other faiths to worship freely and peacefully , that is something to which we should all subscribe ? However , did my hon Friend detect in the smearing attack on Christianity by the hon Member for Bath ( Mr. Foster ) the idea that multiculturalism means that the Judaeo - Christian tradition of this country is no more or less valid than any other tradition ? Is that not something that she and I should reject completely ?\n",
      ">> 1999-07-12a.17.2 0.166 I agree with what has been said about the excellent work of the specials and the depth of their interest and commitment . However , does my hon Friend agree that the fundamental problem in becoming a special is the need to take time off work , and that there is a need to mount a proper campaign—perhaps alongside the Territorial Army and school governors—to persuade employers of the value of that activity ? That would encourage people to put themselves forward for that interesting and rewarding activity .\n",
      ">> 1985-06-10a.633.9 0.174 I welcome the increase in the number of circuit judges . However , does the Attorney - General agree that there are still intolerable delays in the trials of serious cases in the Crown courts ? Is there not still a considerable need for the appointment of more circuit judges ? Does he also agree that it is the judges who carry much of the responsibility for speeding up the terrible delays which sometimes occur in the police force and in the DPP 's Department over the processing of cases quickly for trial ?\n",
      ">> 1985-11-25a.608.6 0.176 Is the Minister aware that there will be a general welcome for the increase in secondments ? However , does he agree with his hon Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet ( Mr. Chapman ) that the number is still tiny in relation to the size of the Civil Service ? What is the impediment ? Is it that there is such disparity in the terms and conditions of service that it is difficult to switch individuals backwards and forwards ?\n",
      ">> 1998-05-18a.596.4 0.179 I am certainly in favour of using the Select Committee system in the most effective way possible . However , does the right hon Lady not agree that , in her Government 's increasingly farcical handling of the arms to Sierra Leone affair , it was hardly a contribution to the effectiveness of Select Committees that , last week , during Business Questions , she should have referred to correspondence directed to the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee that the House had not seen , but which—I need hardly add with this Government—the BBC had ?\n",
      ">> 1993-07-05a.17.1 0.185 Does my hon Friend agree that the significant increase in judicial appointments in recent years from ladies and members of ethnic minority communities is greatly to be welcomed ? However , does he agree also that it is ludicrous for the Labour party to call for some kind of positive discrimination when what the British people need are the best judges ? Is not it absolutely right for the Lord Chancellor to continue to insist that judges will be appointed only on merit and does not the positive discrimination suggested by the Labour party lead Labour into the ridicule and contempt of the British people ?\n",
      ">> 1997-02-10a.1.8 0.190 Is it not a good idea for cyclists to make use of the railway ? I understand that the Secretary of State has an honourable record on this in connection with work that he produced when he was a Back Bencher , which involved my hon Friend the Member for Newham , South ( Mr. Spearing ) . However , has not a new situation arisen with the railways ' fragmentation ? It has presented many blocks and problems , so that information to cyclists about moving throughout the system is difficult to obtain . Pre - booking is beginning to be required . There is the costs problem and there is no official monitoring of cyclists ' problems . Perhaps it is time for the Secretary of State to get on his bike and sort those things out .\n",
      ">> 1995-06-13a.589.1 0.192 Does the Minister agree that any form of discrimination , especially age , is unacceptable ? However , is there not a danger that the slogan \" Too Old , Who Says ? \" could be undermined by Lady Thatcher 's latest efforts to undermine this discredited and dying Government ?\n",
      ">> 2001-01-23a.783.4 0.194 It may not be strictly necessary to mention this , but I have a registerable interest in relation to such matters , which is recorded in the Register of Members ' Interests . The Secretary of State will , of course , have the support of all hon Members for the efforts that are being made to cause the talks to be successful , and he is right to applaud the efforts of President Clinton . However , does he agree that unless there is recognition of the right of return , as contained in United Nations Security Council resolution 194 , then the prospects for a lasting peace will be severely diminished ? Is it not time that the old people who hold in their hands the crumbling deeds of their houses and the receipts that they paid for property tax , should have a hope of returning to the homes from which they were driven or expelled all those years ago ?\n",
      ">> 2001-03-13a.812.2 0.194 I welcome the objective of treating more people in their own homes . However , is the Minister not alarmed that social services budgets throughout the country are expected to finish the financial year more than £ 200 million overspent ? Although he has announced rises in the standard spending assessment for next year , social services directors expect next year to be even tougher . What hope is there that the services the Government talk about can be provided for people in their own homes , if social services departments struggle to meet even their existing commitments out of their existing resources ?\n",

      "> 1993-05-17a.13.7 0.072 I take careful note of what my hon Friend says , as , no doubt , will colleagues from all parties here and in the other place who serve on the Ecclesiastical Committee , which is to meet later this afternoon and which is now the only possible source of delay . My hon Friend can be assured that the Ecclesiastical Committee will present to the House for his benefit a comprehensive summary of the arguments for and against the ordination of women , I believe with an endorsement to the effect that the measure is expedient .\n",
      "> 1988-10-25a.168.1 0.073 With regard to the right hon Gentleman 's point about Piper Alpha , as he knows , that has yet to be decided . I think that there is a delegation to my hon Friend the Minister of State this afternoon to discuss the possible payment of costs on the inquiry . With regard to the IRA and the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board , I take note of his point and will pursue it .\n",
      "> 2003-03-18.746.1 0.085 I take the very simple view—I think that my hon Friend shares it—that if we want more out of the national health service , we simply have to put more in . That is what the Government are committed to ; it is what the Conservative party opposes .\n",
      "> 1981-06-17a.1005.11 0.087 The closure of schools , to which the hon Gentleman is perhaps referring , is in the first instance a matter for the local authority . We take the view that the closure of rural schools is of particular importance in the local area , that proper consultation must take place if a closure is planned , and that the distance between a primary school and another where closure is contemplated must not be so great as to impose a strain on the children or parents .\n",
      "> 1994-07-11a.654.6 0.091 As we indicated in the White Paper last week , we believe that the BBC should provide published objectives for each of its radio services and that the character of its services should not be changed without giving audiences an opportunity to comment on the proposals . I understand what the hon Gentleman says about the potential confusion that can arise .\n",
      "> 1999-10-21a.572.4 0.091 I understand the strength of feeling that underpins the decision that Budgen has made on , I believe , apples and pears . It is selling British produce and not purchasing any more from France . There is a great deal of strong feeling in this country about the French behaviour , and some people take the view that while the French are imposing a ban on our beef we should not buy their products .\n",
      "> 1996-05-14a.758.1 0.091 I am sure my that hon Friend will welcome the fact that , especially in the London ambulance service , increased use is being made of paramedics both in ambulances and on motor cycles . I take his point that we must provide the best possible accident and emergency service for everyone . It is for clinicians to guide how that can best be offered in the circumstances . I am sure that my hon Friend welcomes the great increase in the number of accident and emergency specialist consultants .\n",
      "> 1984-01-23a.617.8 0.091 Of course . My hon Friend will understand that he need not tell me , the right hon Member for Pembroke , about the importance of the milk sector . Nevertheless , there must be adjustments and restraints on prices if the Community 's problems are to be resolved . One of our principal objectives is to ensure that any changes are on a non - discriminatrory basis and that Welsh producers are fairly treated in relation to producers in Europe as a whole .\n",
      "> 1980-12-04a.412.8 0.094 I am grateful to my hon Friend . I recall that at the meetings we had the farmers asked that , whatever conclusions we came to , we would give them the opportunity of expressing support for the possibility of a producer - financed eradication scheme . We are considering the details of that at the present time . The number of outbreaks this year is very similar to the number in the year before . There is no indication of the type of flare - up of the disease that had been feared in some quarters . I should like to eradicate every disease , but there is a priority in terms of public expenditure as to what we can eradicate . If producers are willing to finance an eradication scheme , obviously I must consider the proposal .\n",
      "> 1981-01-13a.842.0 0.095 We shall undoubtedly take note of all views that come to us . One factor that is involved is the tendency of education opinion to move back , I think rightly , to the idea of a balanced curriculum instead of single subject examinations . It is important that whatever examination we introduce has national currency as a passport that is understood throughout the country .\n",

Their problem is the shortage of financial help from the Government to ILEA.

Is it not also the case that , in the light of the climate change review programme published this week , sooner or later all parties in the House are going to face up to the fact that an above - inflation rise in fuel duty is the most effective means of reducing congestion , and of reducing CO 2 emissions in the transport sector ?\n",

      "> 2005-06-23a.944.5 0.078 I thank my hon Friend for his kind comments , and I agree with what he says . The Women and Work Commission was set up because achieving equal pay for women remained a problem even many years after the Equal Pay Act 1970 was introduced . The gender pay gap has narrowed significantly but it remains wide , especially in respect of part - time working . This is a complex issue : occupational segregation is one element , but there are many others . I assure my hon Friend that the commission is fully involved with trade unions and the EOC , and with the representatives of many businesses and employers .\n",

If I might expand on the remarks of my hon Friend , there were reports in The New York Times , during the past two days— [ Interruption . ] I was going to read them out in response to further questions from the Leader of the Opposition , but I never got any . In The New York Times , for example , it was reported that the wave of flu has become widespread , overwhelming emergency rooms , filling hospital beds , and forcing postponement of operations . In many overcrowded rooms , people are simply leaving without being treated . In Ireland , hospitals in Dublin and around the country were forced again to cancel almost all routine surgery and procedures . In Sweden , all the intensive care facilities are full ; some non - urgent operations have been cancelled and closed - down wards are having to be reopened .

I am grateful to him for having recognised how valuable a contribution they will make . On the question of fraud , I understand why the right hon Gentleman seeks to clear his name , but he will know that it was not until 1995 that any serious attempt was made to measure fraud and error in the system . It is true , as I said , that in 1997 some efforts were made to deal with the problem ; however , they focused almost entirely on simply detecting fraud that had already entered the system . The National Audit Office recognised the shortcomings of that as the sole strategy , because it almost encouraged people to let in fraud by rewarding them for detecting it . We have stopped fraud entering the system in the first place . As I have told Opposition Members who have asked the question , the fraud and error r\n",

      "> 2008-07-22c.652.1 0.083 My hon Friend raises a very important point . In fact , he must have raised it in his constituency , as the rates of MRSA and C. difficile infection in the Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust were in decline in March this year . All health staff in the area are to be congratulated . We have reduced infection rates significantly for MRSA and C. difficile . Latest data from the Health Protection Agency for January to March show that MRSA bloodstream infections are down 33 per cent . from the same quarter of last year , and by more than 49 per cent . from the 2003 - 04 monthly average . The same is true for C. difficile infections : in the most vulnerable group of those aged 65 and over , the rate is 32 per cent . lower than in the same quarter of last year . NHS staff work extremely hard to drive down the number of infections . I agree that we must not take our eye off the ball , but we must also recognise such significant improvements .\n",

The baseline survey that we conducted at the outset showed that approximately 95 per cent . of secondary schools and 87 per cent . of primary schools already offered extended activities after school to some extent . There is therefore a great deal of interest and commitment . Extended activities help schools to maximise the attainment of their children and support parents in doing that . Schools that have provided extended activities for some time are convinced of the benefits . I am sure that , as we develop the programme , that will be the case for all schools . The money provided—£840 million so far—is for start - up costs . Schools need to ensure that they sustain activities and we will support them with a charging regime to ensure that they do .\n",
      "> 2004-03-18.445.6 0.087 The hon Gentleman raises several important points . I can assure him that two safeguards are in place as regards any change to trial systems . Such proposals would , first , have to come before this House for its approval following debate and discussion ; and , secondly , they would have to be compliant with our international obligations under the European convention on human rights as enshrined in the Human Rights Act 1998 . As for whether closer work between the Crown Prosecution Service and the police could contaminate the independence of the CPS , the answer is emphatically no . It is a good idea for the police to have early advice on the nature of the charge and what evidence would be admissible . That does not impede the independence of the Crown Prosecution Service , but it will ensure that the police are able effectively to progress the investigation and that the trial works properly .\n",

In my view it is now the case that all our interests are irrevocably bound up with our membership of that body , and it is absolutely essential for Britain 's future to make the best that we can of our membership and to work co - operatively with our European Union partners . The classic example of that is economic and monetary union itself . I do not know whether the right hon Gentleman is suggesting , as he seemed to imply , that the Conservative party has now decided that it does not want to participate in economic and monetary union at any point , but I can tell him that that would be disastrous for British business an\n",

At present , UHT milk in France is selling in Paris at 19 to 19½p , compared with fresh milk on the doorstep here at 21p . There is no way in which that could compete with or undermine the doorstep delivery service in this country .\n",
      "> 2012-01-11b.159.7 0.067 What the Prime Minister said stands . There are no current plans for the MOD to reduce the core police role relating to the security of our national institutions , such as nuclear safety at Coulport or Faslane . National security , including the security of our defence installations , is our highest priority . The reason we have so many MOD police in Scotland in the first place is our huge defence imprint , which would be put at risk immediately if the country were to become independent .\n",

There is evidence of successful setting in certain subjects at certain stages , and other evidence that shows successful mixed - ability practice . What is important is that we enable head teachers to study the evidence that is available and to make the best decision on setting and mixed ability for the children in their schools .\n",
      "> 1982-06-10a.388.8 0.069 The right hon Gentleman wrote to my right hon Friend the Prime Minister . He has made a serious point that deserves a serious and proper answer . First , it is important to say that at no time have we demanded unconditional surrender . We have made it clear that if the Argentine forces in Port Stanley announced their wish to withdraw to the mainland they would be given time to do so with dignity and good order . That is their opportunity . Before their invasion we made it clear to the Argentines that we were prepared to discuss matters affecting the future of the islands with them . Even after their invasion we were prepared to do so if they promptly withdrew . However , their response was to insist on ultimate transfer of sovereignty to them as a pre - condition . That was not acceptable . Since our landings on the islands and the losses that we have incurred , it is unthinkable to negotiate about the future of the islands as if everything was as it had been before . As I am sure that\n",
      "> 2010-10-11c.18.5 0.069 I am grateful to the hon Lady and am delighted to take up the invitation , as I have to many other youth centres and projects around the country ; she may come to regret that invitation . I am afraid that in this financial climate we have to think smarter about how we can provide services . In common with every Department and every other part of this Department 's work , the youth sector is under that scrutiny . My battle is to involve as many providers as possible from the voluntary sector , local authority and others in ensuring that we provide youth services to those most in need of them in the most imaginative way - with less money , because of the previous Government 's disastrous financial legacy .\n",
      "> 2013-05-20b.902.1 0.070 I have said all along that we will keep this under review and talk to local authorities . The Opposition have not once apologised—they did not do so when in government , either—for the fact that , under them , house building fell to its lowest level since the 1920s and that there was more overcrowding . There are 1.5 million spare rooms and 250,000 people live in overcrowded accommodation . There were record levels under the previous Government . Why do they not say sorry for the mess they left housing in ?\n",
      "> 1993-01-28a.1135.5 0.070 The system is not broken , but it has its problems , the main one being that in the main growth area of the market we have been increasingly supplied by imports . We now import 530,000 tonnes of processed products per year , and many of the chips in the great British fish and chips meal are imported . As for seed potatoes , there is no question of a great contraction of British potato acreage in different circumstances . People are not falling over themselves to get out of growing potatoes , but we want more people to grow them . We have more varieties than many continental countries . There is a market overseas for Scottish seed potatoes because we can boast greater variety and expertise than many other countries , and we want to exploit those advantages .\n",

The Minister referred to the Labour Government . Is it not a fact that in 1978 , the last year of that Government , well over 107,000 housing starts were made in the public sector , compared to an estimated 40,000 last year ? This year the figure is expected to be even less . Why do the Government refuse to take action to help people who need somewhere to live ?\n",

When we consider that it took just three weeks to put that event together , it is testimony to what can be achieved with vision and focus . As for the 50th aniversary celebrations in Cardiff , is the Secretary of State aware that while the Millennium Commission has offered £ 1.3 million for those celebrations , to date the Welsh Assembly Government have offered no financial support ?

Is he also aware that the planning of peacekeeping operations is remarkably amateurish and inefficient ? What new proposals is Britain putting forward on that front ?
