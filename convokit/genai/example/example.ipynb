    "# Example of How to Use GenAI with ConvoKit genai Module\n",
    "\n",
    "The ConvoKit GenAI module provides a unified interface for working with large language models (LLMs) while doing conversational analysis in ConvoKit. It supports multiple providers including OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, and local models through a simple factory pattern. This module makes it easy to integrate AI-powered text generation into your ConvoKit workflows for diverse tasks. The module handles API key management, response formatting, and provides consistent interfaces across different LLM providers.\n"

For other models or local LLMs, users can also implement them in similar manner. Here we provide a simple demonstration with configuring for OpenAI's GPT model."
