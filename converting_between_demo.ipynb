    "On the other hand, imagine that you want to take all the data on your webserver and run the latest Natural Language Processing algorithms on it in order to learn something about what people are talking about on your website. This is a computationaly intensive task, that will likely require reading the data many times in a short time period to do the computations. Working with the data in this manner—for computationally expensive operations that only need to access the data over a short time period—would be inneficient to do with the data stored in the database as it would require repeated reads from and writes back to the database; it would be more efficient to work with the data in memory. Thus, we can pull all the data into memory at once by creating a copy of the corpus using the memory storage format, do our expensive computations, then write the results back into the database all at once."
