    "# ConvoKit Forecaster framework: CRAFT demo\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Forecaster` class provides a generic interface to *conversational forecasting models*, a class of models designed to computationally capture the trajectory of conversations in order to predict future events. Though individual conversational forecasting models can get quite complex, the `Forecaster` API abstracts away the implementation details into a standard fit-transform interface. To demonstrate the power of this framework, this notebook walks through an example of fine-tuning the CRAFT conversational forecasting model (Chang and Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil, 2019) on the CGA-CMV corpus. You will see how the `Forecaster` API allows us to load the data, select training, validation, and testing samples, train the CRAFT model, and perform evaluation - replicating the original paper's full pipeline (minus pre-training, which is considered outside the scope of ConvoKit) all in only a few lines of code!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by importing the necessary ConvoKit classes and functions, and loading the CGA-CMV corpus."

    "## Define selectors for the Forecaster\n",
    "\n",
    "Core to the flexibility of the `Forecaster` framework is the concept of *selectors*. \n",
    "\n",
    "To capture the temporal dimension of the conversational forecasting task, `Forecaster` iterates through conversations in chronological utterance order, at each step presenting to the backend forecasting model a \"context tuple\" containing both the comment itself and the full \"context\" preceding that comment. As a general framework, `Forecaster` on its own does not try to make any further assumptions about what \"context\" should contain or look like; it simply presents context as a chronologically ordered list of all utterances up to and including the current one. \n",
    "\n",
    "But in practice, we often want to be pickier about what we mean by \"context\". At a basic level, we might want to select only specific contexts during training versus during evaluation. The simplest version of this is the desire to split the conversations by training and testing splits, but more specifically, we might also want to select only certain contexts within a conversation. This is necessary for CRAFT training, which works by taking only the chronologically last context (i.e., all utterances up to and not including the toxic comment, or up to the end of the conversation) as a labeled training instance. This is where selectors come in! A selector is a user-provided function that takes in a context and returns a boolean representing whether or not that context should be used. You can provide separate selectors for `fit` and `transform`, and `fit` also takes in a second selector that you can use to define validation data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we show how to implement the necessary selectors for CRAFT."
