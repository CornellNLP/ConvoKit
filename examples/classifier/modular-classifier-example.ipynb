      "•       First semester freshman students are not allowed to attend any form of fraternity or sorority sponsored event or activity, regardless of where it is hosted, if alcohol is present.  This includes, but is not limited to, “open parties.”\n",
      "•       Registered events as defined by the Cornell Greek Community’s Event Management Guidelines may continue to be conducted for members and appropriate guests according to Event Management Guidelines, University regulations, and state and federal laws. \n",
      "•       Recognizing that this will fundamentally shift what had become an unofficial recruitment process through social events, which went against the longstanding policy deferring recruitment to the second semester of a student’s freshman year, we will establish a four-quarter schedule so new students may become informed about fraternity and sorority life.\n",
      "When enacted by the Trustees, the amendment serves to align the University policy with those of national fraternities and sororities and the laws of the State of New York.  The amendment to the University’s Recognition Policy for Fraternities and Sororities provides explicit clarification for the University fraternity and sorority community by reiterating the University’s position and policy on these important matters.\n",
      "The University recognizes the efforts of student leaders who have striven to address the high risk behaviors of members; yet, experience shows that risk management through self-governance can fall short of compliance with the law and achieving required objectives without the additional guidance and support of alumni and the University.\n",
      "As a community we must work together to protect our organizations, the students who are members, the alumni who have given so much to preserve the positive experience of fraternity and sorority membership, and the students who seek to become members.  Also critical is the work we do to sustain and support the long tradition of exemplary behavior and values of our Cornell fraternity and sorority system.  Implementation of the amendments to the Recognition Policy requires that alcohol may not be provided, present, or part of any recruitment, education, or initiation process.  Practically speaking, we must alter the ways in which the social programs of our chapters are conducted to conform to the law and the new Trustee amendment.  Compliance by chapters will help alleviate the pressure, real or perceived, placed upon the fraternity and sorority system to serve as the primary social venue for all Cornell undergraduates and specifically for freshmen upon their initial entrance to the University community.   It also will significantly reduce liability by curtailing activities which are unlawful, unsafe, and are typically not covered by the chapter’s general liability insurance.\n",
      "Moreover, in the aftermath of the tragic death of George Desdunes this past spring, the Tri-Council agreed to advance implementation of the amendments.  The $25 million wrongful death suit filed against the Cornell local SAE Chapter, the International SAE Fraternity, and a number of its local officers and members only adds gravity and urgency to our need to cooperate together in implementing the changes summarized below.\n",

They will continue to work with alumni and undergraduates, the Fraternity and Sorority Advisory Council, and the Office of Fraternity and Sorority Affairs to support a strong Cornell Greek System.\n",

Contact with freshmen will be limited to those interactions that occur in the normal day-to-day conduct on campus and in the classroom and through campus related organizations and activities.**\n",
      "       Moratorium commences with the arrival of the freshman class on campus and concludes at the end of fall semester break.  For academic year 2011-2012, this time period will last from **August 19th to October 11th**.\n",
      "       **For freshmen, this period of time should be devoted to academic and residential transition to the new University environment.\n",
      "       Chapter members will not engage with freshmen in chapter organized events or activities during this time period.  This restriction applies to all events and activities including, but not limited to; chapter houses, chapter annexes, residences in Collegetown, or other off-campus locations.**\n",
      "       Chapters may choose to focus on recruiting transfer students and upperclassmen during this time.\n",
      "       The fraternity and sorority system will be presented to freshmen as an option through general informational opportunities planned and guided by the Tri-Council and the Office of Fraternity and Sorority Affairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "o       2nd Quarter – Informal Recruitment\n",
      "       Informal Recruitment is defined as the period when **freshmen are permitted to engage with chapter members in activities that do not involve alcohol or other drugs to learn about individual fraternity and sorority chapters and their members**.\n",

      "       For freshmen, this period of time will be their introduction to the organizations, the facilities if applicable, and chapter members.  The councils may choose to develop and provide a schedule of organized activities during this time period.  For example, the Interfraternity Council (IFC) may create a schedule of supplemental smokers and dinners to allow organized opportunities for freshmen to meet and interact with members to gain an informed orientation to the IFC and individual chapters.\n",
      "       Chapters may host an array of informal recruitment activities to introduce potential members to the chapter’s members, programs, and the values of the organization as well as the physical house itself where applicable.  These events will be free of alcohol, illegal substances, and any form of activities that could be construed as hazing as defined by the Campus Code of Conduct.\n",

Formal Requirement for Asian-Interest organizations commences on January 23rd and concludes on February 3rd, 2011.\n",
      "       **There will be no alcohol or drugs used, furnished, or present during any period of contact with the freshmen.  This includes, but is not limited to; informational sessions, dinners, smokers, day activities, contacts, and night events.  Even if the location of the event or activity is located outside of the chapter house or outside of Ithaca, alcohol and any other drugs are prohibited**.\n",
      "       If they so choose, chapters will extend bids at the conclusion of Formal Recruitment.\n",
      "       Chapters that choose to participate in Continuous Open Bidding will abide by the rules herein stated for the 3rd Quarter.  Continuous Open Bidding must be complete by the initiation deadline, which is April 1st for the spring 2012 semester.\n",
      "       New Member Education is defined as the period when new members/associate members learn the history, values, and responsibilities of membership for their individual chapters.\n",
      "\n",
      "       New Member Education commences with the first day following Bid Day and concludes approximately eight weeks from the beginning of the academic semester as determined by the University.  For academic year 2011-2012, this time period may last from **January 23rd to April 1st.\n",
      "       Chapters will not conduct any social activities or events with alcohol or other drugs if new members are present.  This includes, but is not limited to; activities and events such as “pledge parties” and “mixers” regardless of location.**\n",

      "I don't think I met anyone at Cornell that had a win-lose mentality. My classmates and peers were always happy to collaborate on projects, problem sets, studying, etc. I very frequently lent notes or borrowed notes from students in the instance of missing lectures, for example. I shared notes or borrowed notes from older students who had taken courses that I was currently enrolled in, etc. I would say the collaborative mentality is much more prevalent, largely because Cornell is very difficult. You oftentimes need support to succeed, and people recognize that, so they're willing to support their peers and friends, academically or otherwise. If you try to do Cornell academics alone, you're going to have a bad time.        \n",

      "  \n",
      "  \n",
      "Grade deflation itself isn't prevalent, but getting good grades is difficult. I was an econ major who took a lot of physical sciences and math courses (I was confused and undecided for awhile), and I only experienced one course that was \"curved down\" (deflated). The way curved grading at Cornell typically works is quite simple. The professor will take all of the raw scores at the end of the semester and identify the median grade. Say, for example, the median is a 70, but the professor doesn't want 50% of his/her students to receive a C- or lower. Therefore, the prof will decide on a grade that he/she believed should be the cutoff point. In large, freshmen, intro courses (think general chemistry, calculus, physics, etc.), this is usually a B-. I've heard instances of some courses curving to a C+, and that's really rough but generally uncommon. In upper level courses, it's much more common for the median grade to be a B or B+. That means 50% of students will receive a grade above the median, and 50% of students will receive a grade below the median. How far above or below is based on how many standard deviations you were above or below the original, raw median (or mean). I hope that makes sense. That said, (almost) everyone at Cornell is brilliant, so keeping up with the average Cornell student is very difficult. You have to put in a lot of work, but if you do the work and keep up with the material, you should be rewarded.   \n",

      "&gt; Cornell is notorious for mental health/stress issues, how prevalent is this?  \n",
      "  \n",
      "  \n",
      "I'd say it's prevalent, but I would suggest it's no more prevalent than any other top-20 school with very high achieving and highly ambitious students. It's a stressful environment. Students are usually accustomed to being in the top 1-5% of their high schools, or even their districts. And then they get to Cornell and realize they are no longer in the top 1-5% of performers. This can weigh on you emotionally. Also, a lot in your life changes when you go from high school to college. You move away, you live in a new place, you have to make new friends, you're not with your family, you have new challenges (social challenges, academic challenges, eventually job/professional challenges). And, being 18-22, you're just susceptible to mental illness and stress. None of these factors are unique to Cornell. You will find these at any college, and especially at any prestigious college. Don't let anyone tell you Cornell is a \"suicide school.\" We unfairly received that reputation after a string of suicides, I believe in 2005-2008, but the Cornell student body experiences suicide at rates similar to institutions of similar size. I will say, one thing that is somewhat unique to Cornell is the weather. The long winters without a lot of sunlight can weigh on  you. I moved from South Florida and definitely experienced seasonal affective disorder during my first bad winter in Ithaca. There are ways to handle this though. Counseling, peer support, making healthy decisions, getting outside any time the sun comes out, etc. There are ways to learn to enjoy the winter, and if you're already from a similar climate, you have an advantage.       \n",

      "&gt; What would you consider to be the biggest drawback for Cornell? And what's the best thing about Cornell?  \n",
      "  \n",
      "  \n",
      "This is hard to answer. I think most students will say the location (no major nearby cities/airports) and the weather (tied to the location). I personally loved Ithaca and eventually fell in love with the winter. And, the other seasons are *incredibly* beautiful. It really is an amazing environment with so much natural beauty. Going to college in a college town is a great experience for a young person. And most Cornell students graduate and move to a large city, so they'll have their whole lives to experience that. I think my personal biggest drawback of Cornell was the socioeconomic diversity. Cornell is incredibly diverse in just about every way except for socioeconomic diversity (IE: family income), and this is largely a product of the prestigious higher education industry rather than a product of Cornell policy, though Cornell could certainly improve its policies to attract and sustain more income diversity. Basically, Cornell students are overwhelmingly upper middle class/upper class, with 10% of Cornell students coming from the top 1% of earners in the US (roughly 600,000 dollars of annual income, or more). If you don't fall into this group, you can feel a bit left out. That's not to say you won't have friends, or people will treat you differently. Even wealthy people are genuine and down to earth. But, when you're staying on campus for spring break and some of your friends are flying to Spain or South America, the income inequality really does show. Sort of along the same lines, I think Cornell's biggest strength is the diversity, in all aspects. Diversity of coursework/academic departments, diversity of the student body and where they come from/what they do (everyone at Cornell seems to have an interesting/exciting talent or perspective on life), diversity of buildings, diversity of activities, diversity of Ithaca, etc. I know this is a cliche answer, but I really do believe it. Also, my other biggest  Cornell strength is Cornell Hockey. Our team was really strong this year (finishing #3 in the natioanl standings and #1 in our conference). We also have some of the most supportive and rowdiest fans in the country. Lynah Hockey Rink is famous for the atmosphere, and if you get the chance, definitely check it out, even if you hate sports/hockey. It's amazing. \n",

Of course, if you're into things like environment, sustainable energy, agriculture, etc, you're in the right place.  I'm sure if you know what you are doing that you can find the right people to create tech startups, but something to keep in mind is that at Cornell, you will mostly just be surrounded by people from Cornell.  Going to NYC for example, you will have people from countless universities, and a gigantic startup community all over the region.  I've been involved with startups in Brooklyn, especially Bushwick, and just by virtue of there being sooo many people coming to this one centralized location, there's going to be a larger pool of people.  Then again, at a place like Cornell, you can probably throw a stone and hit a capable person you want on your team.  There's many people at Cornell, but there's no true slackers.  \n",

      "2)My Cornell connections have been so important to me, especially on a personal level.  You're going to find professors who just want to do research and couldn't care less about teaching your class, but you're also going to find some of the most amazing mentors you can ever imagine.  I got to know some of my professors at Cornell, both in music and psychology, and the personal and professional support has been something out of this world.  I came from a culture that told me that \"everyone hates their jobs, and I shouldn't hope for anything better\" and that my only purpose in life was to shut up, get a stable paycheck, and support a family.  My Cornell mentors helped me break out of that mediocre culture and learn to take my talents seriously and to apply myself fully to the world.  When I got my first research job full time out of Cornell, it was my mentor professors whose recommendations got me in the door.  Although I didn't have the explicit technical skills yet, they vouched for my ability to learn and that I'd pick it up.  I spent a lot of time and energy putting my all into my psychology studies at Cornell, and besides developing a very personal mentor relationship with my professors, I made it very clear that I was dead serious and was ready to live and breathe what I was embarking on.  Of course, when I say \"made it very clear,\" I mean that through actions and the best work you can possibly do.  When I got to that first job, just knowing that my professors had that much confidence in me was so inspiring to me that I ended up picking up the technical works, just as they thought I would.  Nowadays, a lot of the research work I'm involved in is based off of those skills.  \n",
      "\n",
      "If you know what you're doing at any state school, you can get a well paying corporate job.  However, a school like Cornell will bring you up to a higher socioeconomic level.  Coming from a culture that was centered around \"work is a 40/hr week miserable tax, everybody hates it, and there's nothing we can do about it, mope mope mope\" to a place where people were truly believed in me and invested in me becoming the most applied member of society I could be was something I never thought possible.  I don't know enough about Harvard or Yale to compare, but there was something about Cornell being up in the middle of nowhere that I think gave it this vibe.    \n",
      "\n",
      "3)When I mention that I did my undergrad at Cornell, there definitely is a \"wow\" factor.  Sometimes, people get defensive and try to one up you, but when I first got out of college, it definitely was sort of a validation with employers in the vein of \"oh, he went to Cornell, let's talk to him.\"  You still gotta have the goods to get hired and it's no magic card, but it doesn't hurt.  I'm currently studying at Rutgers, and it seems to me that if you know your specialized skills, make connections everywhere you go, and take advantage of all your resources, a Rutgers degree will be just as fine as anything else.  Then again, there certain connections and experiences available at Cornell that you'd never get at Rutgers.  Nowadays, the fact that I have a Cornell degree doesn't really matter much anymore.  The personal support from my mentors will always be so important to me, and I keep in touch with them regularly.  Also, the lessons I learned at Cornell, especially from my experiences in the jazz program, about hardwork, dedication, and fully applying yourself are integral to everything I am today.  \n",
      "However, at this point, it's really the work experience and the skillz that matter. For example, when it comes to programming and data analysis, there's a certain point where nobody cares where your degree is from...they want to know you can efficiently and effectively do your data analysis, or at least be ready to quickly pick up a new method of doing it.  The bottom line is that a lot of that is not stuff you learn from your degree, but you learn once you get the foot in the door at a job and are faced with the real world.  If you ask me, real world experience is both higher stakes and more rewarding than anything in the classroom....do an assignment the night before in a class, you might get a B on the project, and still get an A in the class.  Get an A on the project, and it's like whatever.  In the real world, if you half ass a project, you're toast and will torpedo your career because somebody will always be waiting in line.  You will also have wasted everybody's time and money, including your own.  If you ace a project, you will build your skills, build your reputation, build your career, and increase your personal value of what you can produce for society.  \n",
      "I've also noticed that when it comes to grad/med school, professors from college are definitely great for recommendations and referrals.  But once you get into the working world, referrals from places you've worked or supervisors become important.  At your first job out of college, they won't expect you to have a previous place to give a referral.  However when I started working at the second lab I'm at professionally, they wanted a referrence from the first lab I worked at professionally, not just a college professor.  Places that are interested in your work skillz will want to hear from places that are familiar with your work skillz.  Of course, at the beginning of all this was my experience at Cornell.  In a sense, college is like a launching pad to the rest of your life and career.  \n",

      "Hey, graduating senior here! Here's my take on your questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) Pretty big. CS 1110 (intro to CS) is like 575 students and CS 2110 (OOP and data structures) is around 675 students this semester. Intermediate classes like CS 3410 (systems) and CS 3110 (functional programming) are more for majors/minors than for everyone, so the class sizes hover around 200 to 330 (depending on the semester). Upper level classes (4000-level) usually have 50 to 90 students in them, so not too many. There are a few exceptions (e.g. Machine Learning, which has 330 students I think. h u g e for an elective class.\n",
      "\n",
      "P.S. Course names are usually split around the middle: \"eleven ten\", \"twenty-one ten\", \"thirty-four ten\", \"thirty-one ten\", etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Quite easy if you go to office hours regularly, participate on online discussion regularly, ask questions in lecture regularly, etc. Anything to make yourself known! That said, not all professors will be super open/available, so maybe you won't be able to get to know *every* professor that you have.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) I think the other contributor (`sampsyo`) is a professor here, and students do research with him! He's pretty cool, and I think exemplifies the idea that it's not too hard to get research opportunities here as an undergrad. If you take some more specialized classes to concentrate in a direction (read: a few 4000+ electives), you'll probably gain enough experience to begin doing research with someone. That said, I've met students that had significant experience from high school and were able to jump into research right away. My point was that even if you had never done CS before Cornell, you could still learn lots in your first two years to begin doing research in your third year and even turn out a publication by the time you're a senior, I imagine.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Lots! There's the Association of Computer Science Undergraduates (ACSU), Women in Computing at Cornell (WICC, not just for women!), various project teams (CDS, CornellCup, CUAIR, CUAUV, etc.), and then just random small things that people do here and there (e.g. some of my friends had some sort of small computational finance thing called Sparkstone, etc.). Feel free to ask me about any of these!\n",
      "\n",
      "5) Yes, it's definitely possible. I've TAed a class for every semester I've been here except for the first. It's not *that* competitive but then again there are between 15 to 40 TAs for most CS classes and over 600 majors to choose from. CS employs around 350 TAs per semester to meet course demands, so that's not *too* many TAs, but it's also definitely not a small number. As long as you get a good grade in a class (e.g. an A or A+), you should be able to ask a professor if you can TA/consult for it (consultants are like TAs but just hold office hours, i.e. they may not actually hold discussion sections). Honestly sometimes grades matter a little less than willingness to help and general approachability, though. Nobody wants a perfect-A+ TA who can't explain things or is condescending to people.\n",
      "\n",
      "6) Some students do, not sure about most. I found one through personal connections, though that was before the creation of Handshake, which is a decent career services portal we have set up. There are also some internships just for freshmen! Microsoft, Google, and Facebook have some things like that (\"Google Practicum Intern\", \"Facebook U Internships\", etc.). Check those out, because they feed back into the real internships by the time you're a sophomore/junior!\n",
      "\n",
      "7) There's no difference in terms of what employers see. The difference to you is not in the degree requirements for CS, either. The only part that's different is the *other* requirements, like liberal studies, college requirements for distribution classes, foreign language requirement, etc. It's not really that different at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "8) CS 1110, CS 2110, CS 2800 (discrete math), and MATH 1920 (multi. calc) in Engineering, I believe. You need a 2.5 GPA across those classes and a C+ or higher in each class (might be a C-, idk) to affiliate. You can definitely do it after first semester with that credit. I also affiliated after first semester --- just make sure to take both CS 2800 and CS 2110/2112. Though I've seen from the people on this subreddit now that 2800 is apparently much harder. Back in the day I don't think anybody would have sweated a 2110 + 2800 combo, but who knows, times change. 2017 isn't 2014.\n",
      "\n",
      "9) Doable for sure, especially since you're already here. Again, your credit will make it easy. Just get decent grades and I think you have to write some small essay about why you want to do it? Just take Engineering requirement classes instead of the Arts &amp; Sciences (e.g. MATH 1920 instead of MATH 2220, MATH 2940 instead of MATH 2210, etc.). These numbers will become more familiar to you once you get here, I promise!\n",
      "\n",
      "10) These days, a LOT! I've heard that the number of CS majors per graduating year is now nearing 400, and only increasing. For reference, that's around 250 engineers and 150ish Arts students, and there are only 750 engineers in total. So a lot.\n",
      "\n",
      "11) I think it used to be more popular, but people do internships more often than they do co-ops in CS, I feel. There are always exceptions, but maybe I'm not the best person to ask for this. Almost everyone I know has never done a co-op.\n",
      "\n",
      "12) Lots of things! I'm not in a relationship, most of my free time is spent by myself. I play piano, I run outside, I enjoy the nature, I teach, I write (a lot), I play games, and I learn random things (usually not CS-related). Different people do different things for fun.\n",

      "\n",
      "&gt;All potential affiliates are reviewed on a case-by-case basis relative to the following criteria:\n",
      "&gt;\n",
      "- at least a grade of C (not C-) in all completed CS and math courses\n",
      "- a GPA of 2.5 or better in CS 2110/2112 and 2800\n",
      "- a GPA of 2.5 or better in Math 1120/1220/1920, and CS 2800.\n",
      "\n",
      "In case you didn't know how the GPA system works here, each letter is an exact point-oh and each sign adjusts by 0.3. So, you need an average grade just between a C+ and B- across the relevant classes, which is above passing by just a smallish bit. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now let's talk about those classes. 2110 is Java. (I do not recommend 2112 unless you are for some reason dying to jump in the deep water for an honors class unrelated to the honors degree and that won't get you ahead in the subject.) You are only supposed to take this immediately if you have credit for AP CS, in which case you already know Java so this should only be as hard as following the minimal design ideas and data structure concepts they lecture on with object orientation. Otherwise, you take an intro to programming first, like Python, which should prepare you very well for the kind of assignments expected; you just need to learn the new language and paradigm. \n",
      "\n",
      "1920 is multivariable calculus, and is the course you will likely be taking as an engineer. As an engineering math course, it will probably assign problems sets in roughly the same manner as in highschool, and will be more calculation based than proof based. If you can remember formulas and manipulate ugly expressions well, it shouldn't be too painful. I got really bored with it (which might've hurt my grade a little due to lack of attention), but that is engineering math for you: tedious calculational techniques. Just keep doing calculus as you have been for the past two years in highschool. (I like the course the worst of the 3.)\n",
      "\n",
      "2800 is discrete math. For many CS majors, it is the first real, proof-based math course they will have ever taken. Many may even have had a misconception that CS was the same as software engineering, rather than a very distinct branch of mathematics. And many will never need to take another proof-based course again (besides algorithms), so they might not even be too wrong. If you have any mathematical intuition and reasoning skills, and can get used to writing clearly for that purpose, you will find that this course is not really too hard, though the material may seem very new compared to any other math you have taken before. That being said, mathematical competence varies wildly. For some, this will actually be a trivial class, and for others, this course will fail them miserably (though I feel more are in the first camp). If, however, you end up in the latter, CS is really probably not a good fit for you, because understanding a modicum of math like this is enormously important in pretty much all later CS courses. The material is piecemeal, but, once learned, is easy and is core to understanding in pretty much any later CS class. And, if you ever do start to struggle a little, there are tons of undergrad TAs who have taken this course and should be able to get you on the right track, so if you actually like CS and keep at it, failure should not happen. (I liked this course the best of the 3.)\n",
      "\n",
      "For perspective on the grading, averages in the ~75% range are common, and can even yield As when a few higher scores are mixed in. This is the grading trend you end up seeing: classes curve to somewhere in the B range (which is more than good enough to affiliate). Look at the average (statistics are always provided in CS courses) to estimate where you fall; getting above average consistently might as well be an A. Non-core courses may even curve higher than these, too. \n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;Good grades in critical courses may be considered to offset deficiencies in meeting the above criteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which means that, *even* if you do particularly poorly, you *still* have a chance of coming back. But they do discourage reapplying, and with good reason. This these classes are pretty much the most basic fundamentals, so if you can't even *pass* these classes, you really *should* consider another major for *you*, because you simply will not do well with CS. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, with all that aside, I have never heard of anyone being rejected who meets these requirements. (I imagine, even if you meet the requirements, they reserve the right to reject you for whatever reason and probably only use it for egregious academic integrity violations; I've just not seen this happen ever.) I *have* met people who did poorly in one class and could not affiliate with the major, but very few. And they can often successfully fall back on the similar, but less technical majors in the Engineering School, like operations research or info science. (Note: this is not to disparage those majors; there is simply a good transference of the process/design oriented ideas of CS, just without the stricture of perfectly specified and analyzed code that some people find doesn't fit their mindset.)\n",
      "\n",
      "In total, if CS is actually an interest that you have looked into, if you understand it takes a little more than just being a code-monkey, if you aren't in it just for the money or flashiness of the tech industry, then you really shouldn't expect the affiliation requirement to be a big or dangerous hurdle. It won't be free, but it should come. Yes, the average grade is lower here, but also don't forget that comes from a variety of factors besides sheer difficulty, and you can expect to do best in your core subjects, since they should interest you the most.\n",

      "Thanks for the correction on Matthew Shepard. I do appreciate that. And for the record, I would **NEVER** consider harming someone in a situation such as you described, or any situation, other than my own self defense. I do NOT think that's okay, nor do I advocate for that anywhere in my writing or my life. You seriously misconstrued my words. I absolutely respect your right to hold political opinions, but that doesn't mean you are protected from being socially ostracized for those opinions. You have the right to be a white supremacist (an extreme example), but you probably deserve any social ostracism that comes from it. Note: I do NOT think you should be met with violence in that example. And I recognize that if I move to a conservative, religious city and live my best gay life, I'm not protected from any ostracism or judgment that comes from it. Hence my living in a liberal and accepting city.\n",

      "The religious right tends to say that gays being given rights (IE: the right to adopt, to marry) is a violation of their right to practice their religion. Then, they work to expand their right to \"practice religion\" to include things like depriving gays from being gay in the workplace. That's why I related the two. Here's a great explanation of this, and how it relates to workplace protections and the GOP: [https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/403951-16-states-ask-supreme-court-to-legalize-discrimination-against-lgbtq](https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/403951-16-states-ask-supreme-court-to-legalize-discrimination-against-lgbtq).\n",

      "And if it's legal to discriminate against gays, people will **absolutely** do it. This happens worldwide in disgusting ways. It's legal to be executed for being gay in different parts of the world, and **people do this.** In the past, in the US, you could be fined and arrested for engaging in homosexual activity, and **this happened. It was legal, and it happened.** Your rhinoceros example is such an absurd false equivalence that I won't even address it.\n",

      "And to say that my safety won't be threatened for being publicly gay, or that people won't stop me, is just such a massive denial of reality. A lot of research has gone into hate crimes committed against LGBTQ individuals; you can read some of it here. [https://www.hrc.org/blog/new-fbi-data-shows-increased-reported-incidents-of-anti-lgbtq-hate-crimes-i](https://www.hrc.org/blog/new-fbi-data-shows-increased-reported-incidents-of-anti-lgbtq-hate-crimes-i)\n",

      "\"In 2016, 6,121 hate crime incidents were reported --an increase of five percent from 2015. Of the 6,121 incidents reported,**1,076 were based on sexual orientation bias and 124 were based on gender identity bias.** These numbers reflect a two percent and nine percent increase, respectively. ... However, these numbers likely represent only a fraction of such cases, given that reporting hate crimes to the FBI is not mandatory. Thousands of law enforcement agencies throughout the country did not submit any data. And while the number of jurisdictions reporting hate crimes data increased to 15,251 in 2016 from 14,997 in 2015, this is still less than the 15,494 agencies that reported in 2014. The lack of mandatory reporting means that the FBI data, while helpful, paints a very incomplete picture of hate crimes against LGBTQ Americans.\"\n",

      "The marriage debate was propelled by \"protecting the institution of marriage\" on religious grounds. Christians and the religious right felt that gay unions were \"less\" than their God-sanctioned marriage, and thus wanted to deny gays from achieving **equal rights. This is literally about gay rights.** Read what you just wrote - \"I want to preserve the current institution of marriage, and in doing so, I will deny you your right to marry.\" (the gist of preserving the institution of marriage). How is that not about gay rights?\n",

      "The fact that Shepard's murderer was a very angry and homophobic individual, and that they literally tied him to a fence and left him to die, suggests that he was motivated by bias against Shepard's identity. My point that I'm trying to \"prove\" is that walking while gay (or black/POC, or a woman, etc) is NOT an equitable experience to walking while MAGA at Cornell, in large part thanks to the GOP and \"party of family values,\" and that I am under no obligation to accept or tolerate this. These are very real threats that individuals face daily, because of something they never chose for themselves. The fact that 20 states have hate crime laws EXCLUDING sexual orientation and gender identity is, frankly, a massive shortcoming of the American political system and predominantly fueled and propagated by conservative politicians.\n",

      "Anyway, we're pretty off topic from the original post. Just consider the inherent privilege bestowed upon you for being a straight white male, and that supporting an unfavorable political party is **not** equitable to the experience of living as a minority, day in and day out, who only recently gained the right to marry their partner, could still be fired for who I am, faces a higher threat of violence around the country and world, etc. And, as a white gay man in America, I have to remind myself to check my privilege as well. We have it so much better than gays worldwide, POC gays, the trans community, and more.\n",

      "&gt;Dear Members of the Cornell Community,\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;President Donald Trump’s recent executive order imposing a 90-day ban on immigrant and nonimmigrant entry to the United States from seven predominantly Muslim nations is deeply troubling and has serious and chilling implications for a number of our students and scholars. It is fundamentally antithetical to Cornell University’s principles.\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;Ours is a diverse and global university. More than a fifth of our students are from countries outside the U.S. and our students and faculty are involved in programs and partnerships around the world. Over the last few days, we have been in regular contact with our community members who are directly impacted by the executive order, including students on our Ithaca campus; students, postdoctoral fellows, clinical trainees, and faculty at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City; and students at Weill Cornell Medicine in Qatar. We are offering to each our assistance and unwavering support. Cornell will not compromise its admissions and hiring standards of excellence and will continue to solicit, accept, and process applications from international students from around the world, including from the impacted countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;We share the sentiments of many of our peer institutions who have voiced similarly strong concerns about the discriminatory nature of the executive order and the long-term damage it will have on our nation’s global leadership in research and education. The Association of American Universities (AAU), of which Cornell is a member, issued a statement yesterday, noting that the executive order \"is already causing damage and should end as quickly as possible.\" Cornell stands firmly with that statement, reaffirming our founding principle of \"any person, any study.\"\n",
      "Our collective voices may already be having an impact. A Trump administration official earlier today appeared to reverse a key part of the executive order, stating that those from the affected countries who hold green cards will not be prevented from returning to the United States, and several federal judges across the country have blocked, at least temporarily, the implementation of some provisions of the executive order. Still, there is tremendous uncertainty around this policy and how it might be implemented.\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;As a community, we acknowledge the psychological toll this executive order has taken, most notably on those from the impacted countries and their family members and friends. Cornell offers a number of resources (listed below) that I encourage all students, faculty and staff to use as needed.\n",
      "I also want to underscore the ongoing importance of demonstrating respect towards all community members inclusive of background, ethnicity, gender, religion, or political affiliation. There have been troubling reports of bias-related incidents on campus in the past few weeks. We thank members of the community who report incidents through the Harassment, Discrimination and Bias Reporting System. Reporting helps us to address these incidents swiftly.\n",
      "In closing, I want to underscore these important commitments to the Cornell community, including those I made to you in statements late last year regarding the uncertainty around federal immigration policy:\n",
      "Cornell will assist you if you are detained or prevented from re-entering the U.S. while traveling. See the specific resources and phone numbers listed below.\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;The university will continue to honor its commitments to all our current and future Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) undergraduate and graduate students. While it is still unclear how the DACA program will be impacted by Trump administration decisions, our commitments to these students remain firm.\n",
      "The Cornell Law School will provide legal assistance to undocumented Cornell students who may wish to consult with a lawyer about the implications of the federal administration’s policies for their immigration status. These legal advisory services will be free of charge. We are exploring the extent to which law school faculty can offer legal assistance to students and scholars from all Cornell campuses detained while traveling or prevented from entering the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;A dedicated team of law school faculty will also offer legal assistance in the form of representation for DACA students in potential deportation proceedings, should the need arise. There would be costs associated with this special legal representation service for DACA students, and a legal representative fund will be seeking contributions.\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;We will continue to protect the privacy of our student information and records from unauthorized or unlawful intrusion. The long-standing practice of the Cornell University Police Department (CUPD) has been not to seek immigration status information in the course of its law enforcement activities, unless related to criminal violations or threats of violent behavior. While Cornell representatives, including CUPD, will comply with lawfully issued subpoenas and warrants, it is neither the university’s practice nor expectation to function as an agent of the federal government regarding enforcement of federal immigration laws.\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;We have an obligation to assert our principles when policies and administrative decisions are contrary to those principles. Please join me in staying informed, engaged and intent on protecting the principles we hold dear.\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;Yours sincerely,\n",

      "Ah. I've really only ever found one useful study method but it has two implementations: (1) \"explain\" the class to \"someone\" (which may simply be writing an unsent email to a friend) or (2) tell the story of the class. Cal Newport has relatively recently started writing about this, calling it \"the textbook method\". \"The class\" here can be resized to various things: the entire class (very useful for figuring out what you don't know), the homeworks as a whole, each individual homework, the exams.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first case the act of attempting to teach something very effectively clarifies what you don't actually know (and forces you to learn it to actually teach it) and reinforces that which you do know (in a way that \"reading over the material\" does not); it's part of the reason I'm such a fan of helping others with their homework even if the class is curved and even if I were purely self-interested: sure they benefit and raise the curve, but in helping them I learn the material so well that it doesn't matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "To try to explain \"the story of the class\" idea, I'll have to start somewhere else. When I read a (long) work of fiction the first thing I do when I've finished it is tell myself a summary of the story (the major events that happened and *why* they happened). Start with where we started at and the journey we took to get to the place we ended at. I do this to help digest what I've read, but mostly because I'm always really sad when I finish it and this is sort of a coping mechanism. As a side effect, I find I retain the story for longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "So hijack this: tell yourself about where you started the class and the major events of the class that led to the end of the class, but most importantly tell yourself about *why* you learned each thing. I took CS3410 with a very unpopular instructor. Honestly I thought he was great (he explained things well) but one thing he did not do well was say *why* we were learning things. We started the class learning about how to build AND and OR and NOT gates, and we ended the class building program as a DMA network card driver. But it was really hard to learn about AND and OR and NOT gates when you didn't know why (they're boring). I, however, knew why: you need to know how to build those gates to build transistors, and you need to know how to build transistors to build APUs and memory, and you need to know how to build those things to build CPUs and a system capable of general purpose computing, and you need to know that to understand assembly as a set of bits, which you need to understand assembly (and why it's so rudimentary and simple), which you need to understand C, which you need to understand operating systems, which you need to understand C and other languages, etc... (for more, read \"Joel on Software\"'s blog post on the law of leaky abstractions).\n",
      "\n",
      "You can also hijack this for daily life: every time they teach you something figure out *why* they're teaching you that, it'll make it easier to care and easier to remember and easier to learn the important bits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, personally, I don't take notes. I do better in classes when I don't. This works because of resources like online lecture notes, course books (available at library), the internet, office hours, and friends. The point is, there's a lot of resources outside of class which makes it so that you don't need detailed notes of what happened in lecture (if there's something you don't know a month later, you don't need notes to learn it, there are other (better) resources). For some people the act of taking notes in lecture helps them internalize it. For me, it prevents me from paying attention and internalizing things, instead making me a machine that takes audio input and transcribes it onto paper (without any detours into the understanding or memory parts of my mind). If you're a good student (by which I mean organized and start things ahead of time) (I am not), you can spend 10 to 25 minutes a class reviewing what you learned (e.g., while walking to another class) (e.g., by telling yourself the story of what you were taught in class, like the above study method). Cal Newport wrote about this a while ago, something to the effect of \"the no note method of acing a class\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Cal Newport has extensive posts on varieties of note taking (e.g., \"The Cornell Method\") and studying; he's even written a couple (a few?) books on the subjects, though I have not read any of them. I started reading him to learn time management. I personally mostly value him because of his articles on deep procrastination (absolutely nailed why I almost failed out) and what he tends to deem \"the failure of the passion hypothesis\" (the idea that you have to \"find your passion\" and then make that your life's work to be happy, as opposed to the idea that passion is something you build with dedication and effort and deliberate practice), but his articles on time management did help me (probably the most of any articles on time management). The point is that I've pretty much said all that I know on note taking and studying, as a counterbalance you might want to read about other methods and I've found study hacks to be a good resource for that.\n",

      "The shortest version of the tale is that I took a class in combinatorics in my second semester of college as a physics major, ostensibly to try to get into summer research program, but also to serve as a natural continuation for the extreme passion for mathematics that my first semester had cultivated. While my initial days in the class were marked by ebullience and enthusiasm, the weekly homework sets began to prove harder and harder for me. Despite the effort I was putting into the class, I could not see solutions to exercises that others could see in an instant. This is the force behind the angst that my critics would say produced this paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "The natural question to ask is \"what went wrong?\" I place the blame partially on myself for my incompetence, but also on the way combinatorics is taught. My claim is that the culture cultivated in undergraduate combinatorics promotes a very steep learning curve for the subject, and then proceeds to punish those on the wrong side of the curve instead of uplifting them. Whether or not such a culture is a fundamental property of combinatorics itself is a matter of further investigation. The first thing I noticed in the class was a distinct lack of an overarching theme besides \"counting things\" and perhaps \"graphs\". The class was almost taught like a dry analysis textbook, where theorems were stated, examples were exhibited, and proofs were demonstrated. Often times, there was little motivation for the next step in the class. Perhaps this characteristic of the course was partially what made it difficult for me to catch on, but my main problem lies in the culture of the combinatorial community.  \n",

      "There is a jocular saying in mathematics, that all solved problems are \"trivial\". Often times this is true: It is absolutely not clear at first how to solve the differential equation \n",

      "\n",
      "but once a general method for solving these types of equations is understood, a good student (or even a poor one like me) will understand exactly where it comes from and consider the result \"easy\" and \"expected\". I am afraid that in the culture of combinatorics, the above saying is taken all too seriously. When a group of students work together on combinatorial problems, often times one group of students describes the problem as trivial and sees exactly how to solve it, while the other group of students fails to see the solution, so the problem is nontrivial. At the very least, the way combinatorial problems are viewed at the undergraduate level differs from person to person in an extremely severe way, often creating a disconnect between those who see problems as trivial and those who do not. \n",
      "\n",
      "Such a view even extends to the professor. When I went to office hours after a particularly poor homework score, I asked the professor for help on how to think about problems. I got (admittedly clear) solutions to the problems, but not much more other than the assertion that such problems are straightforward. I do not see an issue like this in any other fields besides combinatorics. In the field of analysis, for instance, the culture is to treat problems with the respect they deserve after requiring effort and work to solve. Indeed, I have not heard anyone in my partial differential equations class—much less my professor—describe a problem as \"easy\" or \"trivial\". (My professor likes using the word \"hard\" to describe problems, but I view this as a good thing. In describing one of the problem sets as the \"hardest homework of the course\", it was not to discourage students from solving all the exercises, but it was an expression of respect to the necessary work and thought needed to solve such problems and a categorical denouncing of this so called \"attitude of triviality\". In essence, it was an invitation for all of us to join him on his side of the \"learning curve\", as opposed to derision towards those of us still on the \"low side\" of the learning curve.)\n",
      "\n",
      "I suppose it is now a good time to compare my partial differential equations class to my combinatorics class in the context of mathematical education. While I do not profess to be an expert in this topic, I believe I can say something about it because I have benefited in different capacities from different styles of education. I have nothing but the utmost praise for my PDE professor's educational style, as it is what helped me grow as a student of PDE. A clear example of the superiority of his teaching is when I came to see him at his office hours to ask for a proof of the Arzelà-Ascoli theorem (we had used it in a proof of existence for the IVP for first order ODE, and I wanted to know how to prove it to satisfy my completionist urges). Rather than going through the motions of the proof (which alone would have satisfied me as an auditory learner), he started to build me up on the theory of why we would want such a theorem in the first place. To that extent, he demanded participation from me as well; he had me generate an example of continuous functions that fail to converge pointwise to a continuous function (motivating the idea of \"uniform convergence\"), having me not only show that uniformly convergent continuous functions converge to a continuous function but also explain the conceptual significance of the proof and why exactly we need uniform convergence. (This is to say that he was not satisfied by the correct answer I originally gave where I just cited the earlier counterexample, but made sure I actually understood the reason why uniform convergence somehow worked). \n",
      "\n",
      "The benefits of this form of teaching are clear—the student not only gains the proof of the theorem but also a broader understanding of the (often historical) context of the proof and where the proof \"comes from\". This is perhaps the best way that an educator can not only encourage a student to go beyond what is taught in class, but equip them with the mindset to do so. This stands in stark contrast to the \"definition-theorem-proof\" style of the combinatorics class, where the focus is just on understanding proofs and tricks as opposed to building a general, overarching theory and mindset to progressing further in the field. \n",

      "1a. I don't count credits beyond noting that it's a normal 3/4 credit class; it's typically otherwise irrelevant, since the time/difficulty of the class only loosely correlates. So, here is the rule of thumb on these \"normal\" 3/4 credit classes: 3 is pretty light, 4 is normal, 5 is heavy, 6 is very heavy, and more is basically unheard of. Most people do 4 or 5 a semester. Since it will be your first semester, I recommend going 4, so you can use that extra time to get acquainted with the campus and find the groups and clubs and friends you want to hang out with. Not only is being social important to your mental health, but it is way easier to meet people 1st semester than any time after. And a lot of clubs are really worth it, to the point that some even count as classes (I'm thinking some Cornell music groups and project teams here). As you already list 5 normal courses and 2 mini courses, you are pretty damn packed, and I would definitely not recommend adding more.\n",
      "\n",
      "1b. I notice you mention considering 2112. I recommend 2110, and here is why: People who I knew taking 2112 did not see the light of day, because there is a lot of work. This course is an honors course, sure, but it's not much of a resume booster because 1) it is intro level 2) it doesn't contribute to the honors degree/graduating with honors 3) being harder, it more likely to hurt GPA 4) you will be at Cornell and that is already basically honors. It's not an \"accelerated\" class either, in that you will not be able to skip any classes because of it, or be significantly better off in future classes. Do note that some people still swear by 2112, because it does indeed teach a lot more into the language and gets experience with bigger projects in early, but I personally think they are just trying to justify their decision. I took 2110 and never once regretted it, and I feel like I'm pretty accomplished.\n",

      "2a. I want to lay out some groundwork here: for each degree, there are 2 sets of requirements. I say this because I am a CS major and I have no idea where you think gov applies to CS; I too have AP gov credits, but they go to the Engineering degree.\n",
      "\n",
      "* The first is the degree requirements. This is set by the college. For CAS, this will include your language and a bunch of liberal distributions. For Engineering, this will include an intro programming language, an intro engineering course, and some basic math. You will need to look at the college sites to get the specifics for each, as they have changed slightly since I enrolled. The [Engineering handbook](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/academics/undergraduate/curriculum/handbook/) you will be given a hardcopy of when you come is great guide for both this and the second set of requirements; I don't know if CAS has something similar. AP gov credits definitely cover stuff here, and everything should be able to be double-counted between each different degree unless stated otherwise.\n",
      "\n",
      "* The second is the major requirements. This is set by the department. You will need to see their site (or the Engineering handbook equivalent) to see their policies. Typically, there is no double counting allowed *within* a major's requirements. For instance, CS needs some number of 4000 level courses and a project course. These both must be satisfied separately. But I'm pretty darn sure you can double count between majors and minors, unless stated otherwise (like when there is too much overlap between them, but this doesn't apply to math/cs).\n",
      "\n",
      "2b. Math courses can indeed fulfill technical electives for CS. I'm pretty sure it just needs to be 3000 level or higher. (Recall, though, that they don't double count with the external specialization.) And look [here](http://www.math.cornell.edu/m/Undergraduate/Major/major) about double majors between cs and math; they lay out how they facilitate the double major with double counting.\n",

      "3a. You seem pretty sure you can get those transfer credits without being 100% sure. I don't know your specific situation, but I'd think it would be unlikely to get much unless you already definitely know. It also becomes less likely with higher level courses. But then again, I personally didn't go for any transfer credit. Good luck trying. At the very least, call/email and confirm what you will get before making any rash class choices. [Here](http://as.cornell.edu/transferring-credits) is some stuff about CAS credit transfer, and [here](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/resources/registrar/upload/EN-Transfer-Credit-Form-2015.pdf) is some stuff on transfer from Engineering. Note the credit caps and certain inapplicabilities of the credit usage. In both cases you must have been on the college campus to take the classes and could not have taken them to fulfill highschool requirements. And as for AP, I'm pretty sure there is cap at something like 30 credits. (If I find a source I'll edit it in.) So that means your 12 exams will almost definitely not all get credit.\n",
      "\n",
      "3b. Most of the time exchange between the different intro linear algebra courses is allowed. But the 4000 level courses are definitely above the intro courses. You seem to have taken higher-level math so maybe your mathematical maturity is on point for that level, but for most people it is definitely not. Also, recall that whatever course fills in the linear algebra slot can't be reused elsewhere, so you'd be down a course elsewhere in the degree. I knew a senior electrical engineer that needed to take intro e&amp;m because she skipped it, so don't think over-shooting always gets you out of requirements. So I would recommend the intro course, but otherwise call/email Engineering to make sure the 4000 level would count properly. \n",

      "\n",
      "5 . If you meet the listed requirements, its pretty much a foregone conclusion that you will be accepted. For CS, the listed requirements basically boil down to getting above a C+ average in 3 courses that are curved to the B range, so it shouldn't be difficult.\n",

      "Let me briefly tell you my sentiments as a kind of disclaimer: I love Cornell, but I'm very unhappy in engineering and with the general engineering program as a whole. At this point, I'm willing to throw my advanced standing away and switch majors. I am considering switching into Applied Economics and Management, the business school here at Cornell, while pursuing a minor in Operations Research and Management Science (the only part of engineering that I'm actually interested in). I would never, however, consider switching universities, nor have I actually chosen to depart from engineering quite yet.\n",

      "My advice for you, don't be disheartened that you don't have BC credit; 1910 will whip you into shape for math, and you'll end up more prepared than your average freshman entering with BC credit. Having been through 1920 in my first semester, I can say that I definitely was not prepared for the rigor that Cornell expects of their engineers; not just with BC. 1910 and 1920 have lousier curves, but most courses (if my research serves me correctly) curve in the B range, depending on the class. Others that lack curves may have substantial opportunities for you to succeed (for example, this semester of 1920 allegedly has no curve, but you are allowed to correct your tests for 1/2 credit back).\n",

      "Test-wise, be prepared to do significantly worse than you did in HS. I was a straight-A student in a highly competitive top public high school. Here, I'm good enough to be Dean's List-ed in Engineering. You've got to get used to getting a paper back that has a grade in the 60s or 70s, even if you worked and studied like crazy. It's depressing, but you've just got to keep a sense of self-confidence. Often times, you'll get your exam back, and with such a grade, still be on or near the mean. As long as you do your work and attend lectures, you'll be ahead of a lot of people. Remember, everyone else is in the same boat, and many can't be bothered to actually try.\n",

      "Probably the second-greatest merit of Cornell Engineering (besides the career placement), however, is entirely non-academic. Your advisors don't really know much about the first two years: They will be able to help you if you choose to enter their department, and try to sell you their major otherwise. Engineering advising is horrifically bad and have given me poor advice on several occasions. You'll learn more about yourself, by yourself, than you could ever imagine. You'll learn how you work, how you socialize, how you manage time, how you can live, how you best succeed, and what you can and can't do for a living. I can easily say that I've learned more about myself in the past year than I had all throughout HS. As for class issues, you'll learn the workings of the engineering program through your upperclassman peers (hint: join clubs!), what courses to take, and how best to take them. \n",

      "Use your freshman year, meet and connect with others both in your major and out. Work closely with them; they will be your support network through the good and bad. I have time to socialize on the weekends; the fraternity life doesn't appeal to me, but I would surely have enough time to do it. I am heavily involved in a couple of organizations on campus, and definitely have time left in my day. The severity of the workload isn't bad at all, provided that you stick to somewhere between 15 and 18 credits. Just know that not all credits are created equal, and there are classes that have \"reputations\" for being not worth their credits relative to time invested.\n",

      "Last but certainly not least: In engineering (both here and anywhere), the first two years are the hardest. If you can make it out with your interest, confidence and GPA intact, you're set for the remainder of your time here. The program is designed to naturally push you to a field of study that you're a good fit for. If you know you're not liking something, reassess yourself. I personally don't like the engineering prerequisites and distribution requirements that are required; I have a legitimate interest in ORIE, but it is very difficult to find application to my intended field of financial analysis and management in most parts of the engineering distribution.\n",

      "P.S. Just as a shade of advice, CS majors have people throwing jobs at them right now. At the rate that it's going, the CS job market might become oversaturated in the near future. I would suggest that you go first with the added specialization in ECE (which will teach you some coding courtesy of the recommended CS2110 course), then do a minor or something in CS. What's more key (as far as I've gathered from career fairs) is that you know how to program; I'd suggest that you don't dedicate all your study to the art of programming. That's just my analysis, not sure how correct it is or will be.\n",

      "I went to Cornell and I'm at Princeton for grad school. I did CS. Having TAed for CS classes at both schools, I'm glad I chose Cornell for undergrad. The classes were just a lot better at Cornell, and there was a lot more variety. For example, there is not even a class on databases at Princeton, and the requirements to graduate are too lax, leading to people who are CS majors with lack of experience in certain classes unless they did outside projects. The same could be said about Cornell's curriculum at times, but at least Cornell _offers_ those classes. The one thing is that Princeton has very reasonably sized classes with only around 100-150 CS majors out of each class of 1250. For example, compilers this semester is 5-8 students. At Cornell, it was 60 students in the past and I hear well over 100 were enrolled this semester? Professors can get to personally know you at Princeton, which is nice (although quite possible at Cornell too, just requires more effort). Very few CS classes at Princeton fill up. Almost all of the CS classes at Cornell fill up instantly with waitlists. But I still had no trouble graduating with the classes I wanted, and most people are the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "Medians are about the same, and employment is mostly comparable as well as far as salary goes (see below for a discussion of companies). I wouldn't pick Princeton for the prestige if it's for CS. Honestly, think things through -- just because your degree name has one Ivy League name over another won't actually make a difference in the long run if you're not doing something on Wall Street (I worked at a bank on Wall Street one summer btw -- I could see that there was a palpable difference between HYP and Cornell there, a dichotomy which you wouldn't find at tech companies). Princeton undergrads also seem to work at different companies (Bridgewater, Two Sigma, Goldman, Bloomberg) for CS internships when compared to Cornell (I can't even count how many people I know who worked at Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, Google). Obviously there are exceptions to both but overall Cornell seemed to give very strong employment prospects via relevant tech internships that I don't see at the same level with Princeton undergrads.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you ever change your mind about what kind of engineering you want to do, Cornell has options. Princeton's engineering school outside of CS is meh. It's very theoretical/rigorous, which is great for sending kids off to grad school (many of the undergrad EEs here go off to grad school, for example). ECE at Cornell, for example, is very well structured, very challenging, and has excellent employment opportunities without just forcing you to work as a SWE at a tech company (although some do that). When I came to Cornell, I wasn't sure if I wanted to do CS or ECE, and one of the reasons I chose Cornell over other schools was the diversity of options and the strong/rigorous curriculum no matter what I ended up choosing. Princeton is certainly prestigious, but I get the vibe that that is because of its equivalent of the Arts and Sciences school's majors (and obviously Woody Woo). I don't think that the other engineering majors at Princeton are very practical at all, which is unlike what Cornell offers (a mix of theory and practice). Project teams and practical clubs also abound at Cornell, and getting that same experience or even level of choice at Princeton is nigh impossible. Like I said -- easier to find your niche at Cornell because there is no notion of \"mainstream\" hanging around the air.\n",
      "\n",
      "The social culture is a lot more forgiving at Cornell, too, and you can find what you want a lot more easily with a bigger school. Princeton undergrad culture is just super toxic IMO... I've hung around undergrads here and the eating club culture/pressure to not go independent is real. It just feels very cult-like here, with the residential colleges (you live in the same one for all four years), Zee groups, eating clubs, etc. Everything is sort of centered around \"being part of a group\", which IMO limits a lot of individual freedom that college is supposed to be all about.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, I must tout Princeton for having an insane amount of safety nets in place for their undergrads. They really care to make sure undergrads succeed at Princeton, which means that your residential college dean will be involved in your academic life if things go south (mental health issues, a bad class, etc.). People at Cornell wouldn't really care if you got a C in a class, but at Princeton they stop and email the professors to make sure that you're doing OK. That level of individual concern is really only something that a smaller school could do. OTOH I feel like Cornell helped me experience failure without softening the blow for me, which is an improtant experience to have early on. Princeton gives a much cleaner transition from high school, but they hold your hand a lot (and sort of restrict your freedom). They're very old-school/traditional in a lot of ways, and often wouldn't be willing to change something in the name of tradition. Cornell is a lot more free in that way, which is why I preferred it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mental health resources at Princeton are about the same as at Cornell, which surprised me, as Princeton should be able to do a lot better with the money they have. But it's not a priority for them I guess. About money -- Princeton definitely does a better job with financial aid via grants, so if that is a major concern then definitely I would choose the school that gives you better aid (comparing the schools on the finer points above doesn't make sense if one school is a clear victor in terms of financial choice). I mean going to Princeton won't hold you back, so if aid is the reason, then by all means go there. But if they are more or less comparable, then I would consider what I said above.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah anyway think things through and visit both schools! It's up to you, but because you asked here, I'm obviously going to tell you to pick the better school for what you want to do, which is unquestionably Cornell ;) YMMV.\n",

      "Many professors and faculty are self-proclaimed anticapitalists, anarchists, socialists, and communists. You will spend many classes ~~being indoctrinated~~ having discussions about the plight of labor vs ~~evil~~ management. The closest thing to \"business\" you will get from ILR is Human Resource Management. Human Resources is basically just management's department to deal with labor in order to prevent lawsuits. Basically, give the employees just enough so they don't unionize. They also handle other tasks like compensation, benefits, hiring and recruitment. ILR likes to play up the role of HR to save face, [but they're not exactly cutting edge business professionals.](http://cunooz.com/2013/09/26/ilr-undergraduate-dreams-of-becoming-hr-professional/) In most companies, HR is an isolated department that plays very little role in the core business operations.\n",

      "Everything else either prepares you for law school or prepares you to go work for a nonprofit like a union or for a social justice political campaign or something. If you're interested in finance and entrepreneurship, these careers couldn't be further from what you want. In ILR, you will take law classes and law-like classes. But they are all focused on labor law. If you're interested in doing any other type of law, the stuff you learn (besides for law 101 stuff and study habits) will hardly be applicable. It will give you soft-knowledge and preparation to do well in law school. But do you really need to spend 4 years to prepare for a 3 year degree? It's reading and writing. Yeah, the workload in law school can be demanding, but it's not rocket science.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can also enter law school from any major. You just need a high GPA and a high LSAT. That's it. Going to ILR just to go to law school is a waste of a bachelor's degree in my honest opinion. But still, the majority of ILR'ies end up at law school sooner or later. Maybe they do a few years in HR first, but eventually, many of them will realize how shitty HR is and go to law school to escape the field.\n",

      "1. ILR admissions stretching the truth of what their program actually is to prospective applicants by trying to convince them that it's some magical interdisciplinary program that will prepare you for both business and law. To their credit, it's a solid (even if manipulative and dishonest) strategy since  high school students are used to having a multidisciplinary education without specialization. In high school, you take classes in a full range of topics (math, science, English, history, language, and electives like psychology, economics, etc. etc.) When it comes time for college though, you need to start specializing. Sure, you can take general education courses to fulfill those requirements for 1-2 years, but it's really in your best interest to pick a path sooner than later. It makes sense why prospective students would be allured by a course of study that allows them to have it all without having to narrow their focus.\n",
      "   1. The problem is that it's not \"magical.\" In your 4 years, you're expected to develop knowledge and skills within your discipline so you can apply what you learned in the workplace. ILR though, like other non-specialized liberal arts programs, do not set you up for that. You will graduate with soft-skill knowledge about topics most people don't care about and hardly any skills. Hence, law school or graduate school are often times your only option.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Alumni and current students talking about how many ILR students go to actual business/finance careers.\n",
      "   1. Is this true? Yes. But what they don't tell you is that these students supplemented their ILR curriculum with as many finance and business classes as they could get into (as well as business/finance extracurricular). If they only did ILR, they would not have a chance in hell. So it wasn't that ILR allowed them to do business, it's that ILR didn't get in their way so much that they couldn't do business/finance on the side. Indeed, the ILR curriculum, though as toxic as it may be for a would-be business professional, is not tremendously rigorous in terms of number of required courses. You can even replace some of your higher level ILR requirements with some approved business courses. So basically, you bullshit your way through your ILR courses, pretend to share the same anticapitalist and antimanagement sentiment as your professors, and put your honest effort into the business courses you're taking on the side. This is a very common strategy among ILR students. Even if it's possible, why even have to put up with ILR in the first place if you can just take the business courses without the ILR crap? Instead, if you applied to Dyson, the business classes would be your main focus - you can concentrate in multiple business concentrations like finance AND entrepreneurship, or even take other useful non-business courses such as courses that focus on programming, data science, math, and statistics (stuff that are basically required for new finance recruits these days anyway).\n",

      "From what I gather in your post is that you're looking for specific instances in which students were physically attacked. Something tantamount to hate crime status right? You're looking to put some physical example to describe an overall climate. I recommend that you look the effects micro aggression to get a better understanding of not only why this is a form of the term \"violence\" and how it can have affects on people's lives. For example, there's a study where one group of students of color and women were reminded that historically they under perform in math and the other wasn't told anything. Once each group was given a math exam, the group that was reminded under performed. This is just one example of how different types of microagressions do matter. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'll give you three examples at the bottom of the post from personal experience but first - if you read nothing else, I really just ask you to consider coming at this with an open mind. Right now you're calling your classmates \"cry babies\" and \"children.\" These young men and women are in the same place that you are - an elite institutions. I would hardly classify anyone like that a child. Further, because of what I think is your current mind set, then the examples won't mean anything to you and then everyone's back at square one. And frankly, it's the weekend I don't need to have huge discussions on race tonight,(there's Netflix to enjoy haha.)\n",
      "\n",
      "I think it's also important to consider how you're defining \"truth.\" In a situation in which we're talking about racial bias, truth does depend on the person and the situation. How one person perceives the situation is different than how someone else does. That's why, for example, intent is often less important that how a message is received. And this reality is really frustrating and easy to blow off. How is it that something that's causing so much turmoil and causing a literal list of demands still be really difficult to put your finger on?\n",
      " \n",
      "You've also mentioned that this is by far the most diverse place that you've ever been to. Given that Cornell is primarily white and has small percentage of people of color, perhaps you may consider that your personal experiences might being be affecting your judgement of the situation as well. If you think Cornell is \"diverse\" then (to flip the script on a sentence in your post) you still have a few things to learn about the real world. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'll end this response by just saying that there are definitely, definitely people who \"take things too far.\" In the sense that *everything* becomes a race issue, or a class issue, or a sexuality issue. That absolutely happens. But that doesn't take away from the fact that for every person like that, there's are plenty others who don't over exaggerate and has legitimate claim. Further, yea...sometimes people need to just suck it up. I did. I didn't complain about every single micro aggression or become offended when someone asked me when I learned english (I'm born and raised in NYC). But that's not my struggle - I had bigger fish to fry. These kids...this is their struggle. With every generation new needs and demands are formed and that's okay - it's all about understanding everyone's POV.\n",
      "\n",
      "Examples: \n",
      "\n",
      "1. I constantly had to fight my advisor to let me take more than 15 credits a semester because she assumed that I was a HEOP student (which I wasn't). In fact, at one point she forcibly dropped a course and I had to talk to several people to let me back in. I was never below a 3.3 GPA and was trying to do two minors and a major - I need to make sure that I had all the courses I could - but because all she saw was a person of color she assumed I couldn't do it. This event took up time in my schedule and is just an example of how it was just assumed that I couldn't do something specifically because she thought I was a HEOP student.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. One of the clubs that I joined had an auction as a fundraiser where members auctioned off specific skills that they would teach the winning bidder. One black classmate was auctioning an item and another classmate made a really tasteless joke about slavery. The room got really quiet and the subject was quickly changed. This is an example of how this black student was called out as an other, and reminded of slavery - which obviously isn't what you expect when you're just trying to hang and be like everyone else. Another reminder that maybe you just don't belong.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. There wasn't a director for Haven (the LGBT center) for ages. It was entirely student run - despite there being a handful of clubs and a really legitimate need for a staff employee to provide a voice and credibility to the group. There were students who essentially were there to keep the doors open for anyone who needed a \"safe space\" (I know this isn't your favorite word, but it's the word that fits). After years of demanding, Cornell finally appointed someone part time. This allowed students to actually become not the directors, but the users of services, this allowed for incredible growth in the clubs and activities, and this allowed for a validation from the students that Cornell actually saw them as a legit organization.\n",

      "\n",
      "Dorms.  You'll receive papers soon that allow you to specify roommate and dorm preferences.  According to your personality, you'll want to find a good fit.  Here's how they go:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Mews, Court/Kay/Bauer - the newest and nicest dorms.  Not very social, but beautiful rooms.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Donlon - by far the most social, but an older building.  Rooms are still acceptable.  Design funnels everyone into a central lounge, and there's 90 people per floor.  There's floor v. floor athletic tournaments throughout the year, plus it has the best quiet study space in any dorm.  Always a good time, plus right next to Bear Necessities (Nasty's) and RPU dining hall. (If you can't tell, I lived in Donlon and fucking loved it.)\n",
      "\n",
      "* Highrises - still social, but smaller floors.  Relatively crappy rooms.  Advantage, also close to RPU/Nasty's.\n",
      "\n",
      "* JAM (Low-rise 9) - the music house.  Only live here if you're a band geek.  If you are, it's paradise, if not, you probably won't like it.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Risley - A.K.A. the Freak Show.  Home of the art/theater majors.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Eco-house - Much as it's name suggests, it houses a lot of the more environmentally-inclined students.  Also, it's an overflow dorm, so it can end up with a very weird, not-so-cohesive mix.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Akwekon, Ujamaa, Latino Living Center - Cornell's wonderful racially segregated houses.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Balch - I'm assuming you're a guy.  In that case, you can't live in Balch, but if you want a full Cornell experience, you haven't lived unless you've snuck out of a girl's room in Balch trying to be all ninja-ish to avoid RA's and staff (it's an all-girls dorm, men need escorts to walk around.)\n",
      "\n",
      "* Clara Dickson - Also pretty social, but not really designed well.  Doesn't have good central meeting places.  Does have a beach volleyball court.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Townhouses - If you're prepared to essentially live in an apartment, do this.  They have kitchens, and decent common areas.  You generally won't need to hit up the dining halls if you live here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Food.  RPU will be your best friend.  Appel is also good, but not as good.  Bear Nasty's is your best source of late-night food.  On central campus, Okenshield's has the nickname Oken-shits, but it's not that bad, and they accept meal plans.  The Ivy Room in Willard Straight is cash/Big Red Bucks, but it's by far the best food on central campus.  There's also Trillium, if you're an engineer, and Mac's, under the Statler, if you're a hotelie.\n",
      "\n",
      "Parties.  You'll be fratting your freshman year.  It's the best way to meet people, to decide if you want to rush, and frankly, the best way to get fucked up.  Cornell is a dry campus, so you're not allowed to have any alcohol in the dorms.  Considering that any semblance of a dorm party will get shut down immediately, it's just not worth the hassle of getting in trouble.  Just walk down to University Ave (AKA frat row) and do your drinking there.  Also, The Hot Truck on west Campus and Louie's Lunch on North are the two greatest food trucks you will ever experience.  Take advantage of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Girls.  I may be a bit biased given that my current girlfriend went there, but gentlemen, Ithaca College is the place to be.  The girls are simply more attractive, bigger partiers, and way less concerned about making it to class the next day.  If you can trek over to the other hill, go have fun.  In addition, half the girls at any frat party are probably IC girls.\n",
      "\n",
      "Academics - fuck this.  I'll tell you the only thing, as an Arts student, that you need to know.  You can take one class per semester pass/fail.  Use this to get rid of every stupid breadth requirement you don't want to take.  In A&amp;S, you have to take a foreign language, a science, a math, etc.  Take them pass/fail so you can devote more time to your major GPA.\n",
      "\n",
      "The town.  Explore Ithaca.  A lot.  It's a great city, and there are lots of fun people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Weed.  Approximately 50% of the people in Ithaca smoke weed, no joke.  If you're an ent, this'll be paradise.  If not, you've gotta at least try it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your Advisor.  Cornell will assign you an advisor when you get there.  As soon as possible, I would advise finding a professor you like in your interested field of study, and asking them to be your advisor.  They'll be infinitely more helpful than your randomly-assigned advisor, and will most likely develop into a solid recommendation letter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Libraries - You'll discover different nooks and crannies depending on your study style, but there are a couple places you have to check out:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Olin - The carrels.  Each floor has carrels lining the entire outside walls of the building.  They're all technically reserved for grad students, but you can always find a free one.  The basement - best place in the summer, it's cool and has outlets everywhere.  You'll find that you want your computer charged at all times before going to the libraries, as outlets are not exactly a priority in a lot of the old buildings.\n",
      "\n",

      "Athletics - Cornell hockey is amazing.  Basketball was great while I was there, not so much anymore.  However, no matter what, at least once, you have to go to a Cornell-Harvard hockey game.  Best sports environment in the Ivy League.  Also, I'm not sure if you can still do this, but you used to be able to get a big red sports pass for free that either let you into damn near every athletic event for free, or at least massively reduced ticket prices.  I think I only ever paid a couple bucks a game for basketball, maybe a couple for football, and then hockey was the biggie.\n",

      "So I had some extra time because July 4 and all, and I thought I’d do something personally interesting. I’m not that open for being identified, but I’m a recent engineering grad (past 5 years). I know freshmen (incoming and first/second semester students) tend to worry a lot about grades. I saw the median grade spreadsheet that includes data from different classes, and thought it would be interesting to see what my own experience summarized would look like \\[[imgur album](https://imgur.com/a/Tgk4mkN), individual pics linked below too\\].\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I made a [distribution of median grades of classes I took by semester](https://i.imgur.com/svQ3yzb.png). These aren’t weighted by number of credits, just number of classes. The numbers in the boxes correspond to the level of the course. This isn’t all inclusive because 5000 and 6000 level courses don’t post median grades. This also doesn’t include classes taken S/U. The major category includes classes required specifically for the major (affiliation requirements and any class under the department). The non-major STEM category includes the engineering core curriculum (math, chem, physics, etc.) and other classes taken in a science or engineering department that weren’t my major. Non-STEM is everything not included in the previous categories (FWS’s, liberal studies, etc.). I came in with some AP/IB credit, so I placed out of a couple engineering core classes, otherwise there might have been a B- or C+ median, but I don’t think that’s too significant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Observations about this first chart include a few main ones. All of the non-STEM classes I took had a median grade of at least an A-. This is likely heavily skewed by electing to take easier liberal studies classes, but not all of them are necessarily known as easy A’s. In contrast, none of the classes in my major (that I took) have a median grade of A. The only ones with a median of A- were taken during my senior year. 3000 level classes also don’t mean higher median grades. Most of the 3000 level classes I took were within my major and none were liberal studies, so that could also explain it, but only one 3000 level class I took (which had a reputation of being an easy A) had a median above a B+.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next thing I looked at was inspired by the [median grade spreadsheet](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/8o539b/median_grade_spreadsheet/). I looked at the some [statistics of the median grades](https://i.imgur.com/z7Kl7Vx.png), which isn’t great given the limited sample size, but that’s all I have at my disposal. I looked at the average median grade point, the weighted average (by credit) median grade point, and the median median grade point (didn’t do a weighted by credit). The results were unsurprising (at least to me). Classes taken for my major had the lowest average and weight average median grade points. Non-STEM classes had a significantly higher median grade point, but again, these are highly elective classes. The STEM classes outside my major were higher than inside my major, but that could be skewed by that one easy A course. The median for both major and non-major STEM courses was a B+, as was the overall median median grade point for all of the classes I took.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I looked at these [statistics by semester](https://i.imgur.com/T7GxEOp.png), which is even more flawed due to the even smaller sample size of each group, but oh well, I thought it would be interesting. This time, there is no differentiation between class type, only by semester. I don’t think you could say there is a significant increase in median grades in my case until senior year. The red sparkline is a general trend (not actual values) in my overall GPA.  Interestingly enough, it does follow the general increase and decrease with median grades, but to a smaller extent in later semesters, suggesting your GPA can’t change too much in your senior year due to the large number of existing credits, despite higher median grades. This observation is also not great, because it doesn’t account for the 5000 and 6000 level classes that I took in my junior and senior years, as they don’t have published median grades.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, I’m not sure what real conclusions you can get from this post, but it’s something concrete to look at for those curious. I don’t really know if there are good takeaways from this either. I guess liberal studies do tend to increase your GPA. Don’t be too worried if your GPA is lower than what you had in high school. Don’t be worried too much about grade deflation (because honestly, a B median isn’t grade deflation. It’s just not grade inflation. But also, with the number of classes with an A- and A median at Cornell, it could also be argued that there is a decent amount of inflation). There’s only so much you can do about your grades. Try your best, but also keep up your mental and physical health. Everything will be all right in the end. I’ll answer general questions, but nothing too identifying. I hope someone else other than me found this interesting. Enjoy your Independence Day, Cornellians.\n",

      "When I was in the process of applying to college in high school, the first thing that I looked for in a university was a great undergraduate engineering program. As such, Cornell was on my list from the beginning. I was sure that I wanted to do engineering, but wasn't sure what exactly in engineering I was interested in (CS, materials science, biomedical engineering, and chemical engineering were my main interests at the time), so I wanted a university that had a lot of options for when I made up my mind. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, I chose Cornell less for its academic prowess and more for the feeling that I got on my first tour. My dad went to Cornell Engineering for his undergrad, so I had been on campus several times before, but Cornell was the first place where I stepped on campus and felt like I could actually live here for four years. I love the huge campus, and I love the fact that Cornell still feels like a small community in spite of its size. I met and had lunch with students in engineering, and they seemed like people I'd want to spend time with. They didn't fit into the \"engineer\" stereotype, and were able to balance their work with their extracurricular interests. They were also able to take liberal arts classes (I'm into languages and creative writing), which was something that seemed difficult to do at many of the other universities that I attended.\n",
      "\n",
      "So far, I have not been disappointed. I'm a sophomore now, and I've throughly enjoyed my experience at Cornell. I'm a member of four or five clubs, I participate in my residence hall community, I've made friends with some really cool and interesting people, and I work in a research lab doing work that could have significant positive impacts on the medical community.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of the student environment, engineering is extremely collaborative. I've made some of my closest friends through homework and group projects that I needed help on. The College of Engineering places a huge focus on collaboration and teamwork, so everyone is always happy to help if you're confused on something, or work on a problem set with you, or study for an exam. I've walked up to random people in Duffield Hall (the engineering social hub) who were working on homework for a class that I was taking, sat down, and asked them if they want to work on it together, and I've never been turned down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, I've never been bored. Given that we aren't in a city like NYC, most events/activities occur on campus and are run by student organizations/the university/greek life. At any point in time, there are festivals and athletic events (hockey games are super fun) going on that are open to the public. If you like to go out a lot and party, you can totally do that. Greek life tends to facilitate that, and most of the fraternities are situated very close to campus, so you can go out whenever you want. There are also a few clubs in Collegetown. If you're interested in social outings, there are an infinite number of options for that, especially given that freshmen get a free bus pass. There are fun formal events at the Johnson Museum where everyone gets to dress up, and there's a restaurant/bar near campus that does salsa nights on Wednesdays that I've heard are awesome. We also have things like Slope Day, a giant music festival in the spring.\n",
      "\n",
      "I like the blend of technical and non-technical courses that I get to take in engineering as well. We're required to take 18 credits of liberal studies courses to graduate, which amounts to about six classes over five years. Most freshmen don't take liberal studies courses, so you end up taking one every semester from your third semester on. I came in with a lot of AP credit in the humanities, so I don't have to take all 18 credits (I came in with 12 of the 18 credits), but I'm planning on doing a creative writing minor and taking several French courses. Obviously, our curriculum focuses on the engineering courses, but it is also flexible enough to allow you to take classes outside of engineering .\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking more generally, food was an important part of my college search, and Cornell has some of the best food I've had in general. I'd recommend the 14 meals/week plan to start, because you may eat breakfast and dinner on North campus as a freshman, and eat something smaller on central campus for lunch. There are a ton of options for food, so you'll never be bored with it (escpecially if you eat on west campus).  Statler has the best food on campus IMO, and they have a student run restaurant that does fun themed dinners every week. The food there is amazing, and pretty cheap ($15-20 for an entree and appetizer/dessert). \n",
      "\n",
      "The dorms are generally pretty nice. North campus has a lot more variance in quality, because the dorms have been build over the past few decades, but everyone I know was happy regardless of where they were. I lived in Dickson, the largest dorm on North, and I loved it. It is mostly singles, which was what I wanted, but it's really social. I made some of my closest friends through my hall. Court-Kay-Bauer and Mews are the nicest/newest, and have air conditioning. Donlon is the party dorm. \n",

On a whim, I checked out housing co-ops and found that they were filled with caring, smart, and talented people who were interested in more than the rat race.

But maintaining my intellectual curiosity by taking classes that involved actually creating something (sculpture, narrative writing, creative writing, wood construction (RIP)) or learning something completely frivolous (human bonding, mushrooms, wine and beer, food science 101) was so critical to keeping sane for me. One of the best things about Cornell is that you can take a class in literally any subject, and you'll be taught by one of the leaders in the field.\n",
      "\n",
      "* being part of one or two clubs that allowed me to have *structured* time to hang out with others. For me, this was a music ensemble. For others, rock climbing, or joining a D&amp;D campaign, or being part of a religious group, or playing a club sport were all extremely worthwhile.

Chilled on the fourth floor of the museum, looking out over the lake on a nice day? Listened to a chimes concert from the top of the clock tower?

If you don't know how to get one, just start asking people you have classes with or are on a project team with. I went through my undergraduate work on my own because I wanted to prove something to myself. But that was stupid.

Here are my suggestions that are specific to you:\n",

      "I have to agree with this, but I feel the need to elaborate more on the harsh reality. If you failed gen chem, then you should seriously think about your ability to succeed on this track. Truthfully, gen chem may be one of the hardest classes you'll take in undergrad, but the ability to succeed in it is a good predictor of success later on. Gen chem requires you to be able to look at a problem, frame it in a certain perspective, and quantitatively answer it - not just memorize things. These are skills every doctor should have. If someone can't succeed in gen chem, then I wouldn't want them to be my doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, if you can remedy this over the summer, then give it a shot and do organic in the fall. Sometimes organic clicks for people in a way that gen chem doesn't. If that's you, then don't despair too much. But if you also struggle in organic, then this path may not be for you. It only gets harder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly, you should do some soul searching. Ask yourself why you want the MD. An MD has a tough undergraduate curriculum, requires immense work beyond your course work, another 4 years of school, a residency, and will put you in massive debt. Further specialization is going to cost you even more time. You won't start your life until you're almost 30. Are you following this path because the MD is the only way to meet your goals? There are lots of peripheral jobs that require different skill sets and less training that have just as much impact for patients. What are you good at? What occupations use those skills? You are young and at the beginning of your undergraduate education, now is the time to reflect on the past year and figure out how to move forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you intend to stick to pre-med, then this is the advice I give to all pre-med students.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Don't be a grade monger. Most programs only want to see you meet a certain minimum for your GPA. This ranges from 3.2 to 3.7 generally. They also want to see particular grades for particular classes (the weeding classes mostly). Fretting over points will just make the professors, teaching staff, and fellow students dislike you. It comes across as \"I'm not interested in improving or learning, I want you to give me more credit for what I've already done\". In the end, the extra points don't matter. The points students get for being annoying aren't changing their letter grades, and if they do, you probably could have gotten that letter bump through a more amicable relationship with the professor.\n",
      "2. Get a hobby, now. Find something that you are passionate about and get to it. It doesn't have to be relevant to being an MD, but most programs are looking for students with interests and personalities, not just boring academics slogging through courses. Committees want to see that you have interests and that you're able to pursue them on top of all the work you've been doing.\n",
      "3. Get involved with something. Research is probably the best in terms of something to put on your application, but any leadership or long-term volunteer position should work. Successful undergraduate researchers have all the skills committees want in their candidates. However, it might be hard to find a lab if you failed gen chem. The point is to find something 'professional' and commit to it for 2-3 years.\n",
      "4. Learn the material. Think about the problems. Don't just memorize everything! Make sure you understand the prerequisites for the class (that includes the math required to succeed). A lot of students struggle with 'weeding' classes because they require critical thinking and abstract thought. No offense to the biology classes (I'm a biologist myself), but they rely too much on memorization. Let's look at gen chem, which is basically simple algebra applied to word problems. Most students can answer direct questions like \"Calculate the hydronium ion concentration of a pH 9.00 solution.\" That doesn't require any thought, it's just a formula. Students tend to struggle when that same concept is now obscured in a word problem, or is part of a larger sequence of steps - like you're given several solutions and you need to calculate the pH after mixing them and achieving equilibrium. Students can do each individual step, but they're unable to do so in the context of a 'real' problem. This happens because they're not actually learning the material. Instead, they've learned a mechanical practice that this piece of information is used in that formula to get an answer. It's particularly heart-breaking when they need to perform simple algebra to rearrange an equation to get their answer and they can't do it because \"it wasn't in the practice problems\". Memorization is not enough. You need to actively think.\n",
      "5. View learning as expanding your model of the world. Frame all problems in the context of your model. This expands on the previous point. Education is cumulative. Particularly the pre-med track. You should have a nice little simulation of the world in your head and as you learn things, you add them to the simulation. Then when you see a problem, you plug it into your simulation and you use that solve the problem. For example, let's look at a 'simple' physics problem. You drop a ball down a frictionless slope onto a flat segment with a known coefficient of friction and a frictionless ramp at the end (something like this - \\\\_____________/). Does the ball go over the ramp? If not, how many times does the ball roll up and down the ramp? In your head, it's simple enough to imagine this situation. Either the ball goes over, or it doesn't and rolls around before coming to rest. Now you need to look at the math behind your simulation, the equations you learned, and figure out which ones to apply here. The first question is, does the ball start higher than the ramp itself? If not, you know the ball will never make it over and you're done. You don't even need math for that. If the ball does start higher, then the question is, does the ball have enough energy to overcome friction and the potential energy of the ramp? That's pretty easy to calculate too just based on how far the ramp is and how tall it is. If it can't make it, then you simply need to calculate how far the ball will roll before it loses all it's energy to friction and how many times it must cross the flat segment to achieve that distance. The key here is that you consider all the possible scenarios and then plug in the values from the problem to figure out which situation is true. As you advance in your field, you'll be able to account for nuances in your simulations of expertise.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I would mull that over. Sorry it's long, but that's how it is.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last, I was a TA for gen chem a few years ago. If point #4 sounds like you, then I have advice on how to succeed in gen chem should you go back for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Get really comfortable with algebra. Be able to work with the alphabet soup and know how to solve for each variable. Substituting in the values and then solving for your variable confounds the algebra and stops you from thinking about how things actually relate to each other. Also, know how to exponentiate and what log(x) means.\n",
      "2. When looking at a problem, ask yourself what should happen. If you say \"I don't know\" then you don't know the material. If you say \"I know what should happen, but I don't know how to quantitate it\" then that means you know the abstract material and just need to locate the right formula. If you know what formula to apply, but not why, then you don't actually know what you're doing and should revisit the material.\n",
      "2. Does your answer make sense? Is it physically possible? If not, you're probably wrong. At least leave a comment that you know it's wrong.\n",
      "3. Do the homework by yourself. Do the pre-labs. It can be grunt work, but you're not gonna learn anything if you don't do it or if you rely on others to do it for you. After you've given it a shot, you can consult with others, but don't work with them from the start. Different professors give different quality homework though... Dr. Hines gives particularly useful homework in that she makes short, challenging problem sets. Textbook questions tend to lame, unoriginal, and minimally productive, except for the last 10 or so in a chapter.\n",
      "4. If you're still struggling, seek out chemistry word problems and tests. You want the open ended questions like you find on tests. Give them your best shot, then look at the answers. The only way to learn abstract thinking is to apply yourself. It's not something you can learn from reading the text and memorizing simple questions.\n",
      "5. Use the faculty and TA office hours. If you're struggling, then demonstrate to the professor that, by God, you're giving it your best. Prioritize the professor's office hours. Most of the gen chem TA's have never TA'd before and haven't taken gen chem since they were undergrads. They can help, but they're not as good as the professor. The professors have decades of experience. They can probably teach you better and have final say in your grades. Schmooze them. Do not nitpick them for points though. Also, remember that the TAs assign participation points at the end of the semester, which basically boils down to \"how annoying was this student?\".\n",
      "6. Be a nice enough and friendly enough person that the teaching staff know your name or at least recognize your face. Most students are wall flowers that you forget about once the course is over - they attend class, but they rarely speak and don't attend any of the extra stuff. The most memorable students are annoying and you never want to talk to or see them again. But our favorite students are the ones that try earnestly and seek out our help when they need it. Those are the ones that we subconsciously bias grades for and give them the extra point here or there because we know what they were getting at. The former we tend to be overly critical of and subconsciously take points from them because we doubt whether they understand the nuances of what they're doing.\n",

      "**Ok, here's the answer you're looking for:**\n",
      "\n",
      "(I'm actually just going to post this directly to /r/Cornell now that I see how big it has become)\n",
      "\n",
      "**1) [Click Here For the Data](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=weather+in+14850+in+2014)** (you can change the 14850 to your zip code to compare.)\n",
      "\n",
      "**2) Here is my commentary on the data:** Cornell weather is not that bad for most people along the northern border of the U.S. It can get down to -10 F (last year it hit -17) but there are only a few weeks when you're below 10 degrees F. Windchill a little worse. Cornell is in a flat section of the state and that means lots of wind, but not as much as any costal town or city. This means windchill can be a factor. At the end of the day, anyone from NYC or Chicago would be fine at Cornell. Cornell only gets such a bad name because it has a big campus and attracts many students from far away who are woefully unprepared.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3) Here is my description of how cold weather works:** I think this is important. Numbers are meaningless without the ability to interpret them. You are from Texas, I see. I know the idea of sub-zero is foreign, but truthfully, it just means more layers. I'm not going to go off on talk about air pockets. Instead let me talk about what it takes to feel comfortable, to feel warm. First, no individual body part can be cold. Second, the body cannot feel its core temperature dropping.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ok, what this means is if any part of your body is exposed to cold objects that *conduct heat* away from you body quickly then that body part is going to feel cold. Things such as carrying books without gloves, walking in thin shoes (*especially* if they're wet, oh god water is a good conductor of heat), or wind on exposed skin will suck the heat from those parts of the body. This makes them feel cold. What that means for you is three things: boots, gloves, hat.\n",
      "\n",
      "But here's the truth about all of this: you are a big bag of circulating water. Your body is more than happy to just throw heat at your hands to keep the tissue at normal temperature. It's more than capable of it as well. The problem is that when your body feels its core temperature dropping it panics and constricts blood flow to your extremities. It is willing to sacrifice some heat in the hands (or feet, or nose) to try to conserve as much heat in the torso as possible. This means the hands get cold and causes pain. A lot of times you'll see someone with gloves on talking about how cold their hands are, cursing the gloves, while someone right next to them isn't wearing gloves and feels fine. The difference is that person has warmer clothes around their legs and torso, and that means the body has excess heat to throw at the hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Try this experiment sometime. Pick up an ice cube. That is literally all you have to do. Roll it around in your hand and feel how it doesn't make your hands hurt. That is because—and I'm going to get kinda patriotic in a \"the human body is awesome\" kind of way—that little piece of crystalized H20 does't have *crap* on the thousands of miles of intricate water circulation system dedicated to keeping that patch of tissue exactly the temperature it should be at. If you can make your torso *hot*, then only 10 degrees or below weather *with* a windchill will be strong enough cause real discomfort to exposed skin.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4) Here is a discussion on clothes:** Truth be told, this question is better answered in terms of what you need to wear. You feel the same in the dead of winter at Cornell as you do in fall at Texas. As the Swedes say: \"there is no such thing as bad weather, just bad clothing.\" This does not mean you need to spend a lot on clothes. There are a lot of ways to design a warm winter wardrobe, but here are some of the basics.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, there are three different kinds of layers: the wicking layer, the warmth layer, and the weather layer. Wicking is just what goes on your skin or near it. It should be breathable and *wick* (pull) moisture (such as sweat) away from your skin. I really don't pay attention to this. I'm a Boy Scout so on weekend long campouts it's important, otherwise t-shirt and underwear is fine. Second is warmth. This can be a fancy parka or jacket, or just sweater. Third is weather, and this means wind and water protection. You do not want water or wind pulling heat directly from your torso! When implemented it looks like this: underwear, t-shirt, winter jacket. The winter jacket has both warm and weather built into one. If you need more warmth, add a sweater, then long underwear, then another sweater.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other things to think about:\n",
      "\n",
      "* You have to be careful about being able to take off layers. Too much and you'll be too warm inside. That's why I have a few different jackets depending on the weather, because ideally you want to be able to take off only your outside layer and be cool enough indoors. I avoid long underwear because of this (if I can). I have a light jacket for fall and a heavy parka for winter, that I can unzip if I'm too hot and take off once inside.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Boots are a big one when snow hits. They prevent wet (and thus, cold) feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Face masks are great for the worst months. I really recommend a balaclava hood. It is a scarf and hat in one, with a face mask that can be pulled up to cover the nose and mouth. If you wear glasses make sure you get one that has holes/thin fabric in front of the mouth to prevent it from fogging up.\n",
      "\n",
      "* I highly recommend any gloves you get have a wind blocking layer. Otherwise they are basically just swiss cheese. Sure they're warm in still air, but add a breeze and they might as well be in your pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Cotton and wool are warmer than most synthetic material, so if you are looking for a hoodie or sweater as an intermediary pick those when in doubt. Note: they suck with wind resistance without other fibers mixed in or special treatments. Coats are often measured in a goose down number. I never understood the details, but basically it means the coat is as warm as a certain packing of goose feathers. You will see \"goose down 600\". The higher the number, the warmer, on a roughly linear scale.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5) Specific clothes to buy:** For the benefit of people who've never shopped cold weather gear before, I'll post some specific products and links. For the most part, I'm posting frugal buys that will get you through the rough of winter. Feel free to dismiss items that don't appeal to you, this is only a set of examples.\n",
      "\n",
      "* LLBean is a great company IMHO that has tremendous warranties, prices, and customer support. Click [here](http://www.llbean.com/llb/search/?freeText=winter+jacket&amp;init=1) for some of their jackets. I would recommend a Jacket that goes down to -25 degrees F from them (because you don't want to have to rely on wearing long underwear and a sweater, as they assume with those ratings). My fav is the [Weather Challenger 3-in-1 Jacket](http://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/83559?feat=3%20in%201-SR0&amp;page=weather-challenger-3-in-1-jacket).\n",
      "\n",
      "* Other options for coats on a budget are surplus military stock. They have no military markings, are made to be stylus in a plan way, durable, and very functional. Two example sites are [Army Surplus World](http://www.armysurplusworld.com/display.asp?subDepartmentID=276) and [Army Navy Outfitters](http://www.armynavydeals.com/asp/Default.asp?). Crappy websites but good products.\n",
      "\n",
      "* You want a good pair of warm walking boots. Mickey Mouse boots are a name given to a particular type of boots used by the U.S. military. They often have ugly yellow text on them, but that's only if you look at them up close and for as cheap as $20 from [here](http://stores.alleghenywholesale.com/usgi-military-bata-black-mickey-mouse-boots-w-valve-20f-brand-new/) they deserve a mention.\n",
      "\n",
      "* [These gloves](http://www.mechanix.com/cold-weather). They are a little annoying because of the logo, but Mechanix Wear makes the most functional gloves out there. Just the $10 [Thermal Knit](http://www.mechanix.com/cold-weather/thermal-knit) will do you well.\n",
      "\n",
      "* If you don't wear glasses, but [this](http://www.amazon.com/Chaos--CTR-Chinook-Balaclava-Windproof/dp/B002ZG7RFI/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1428097222&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=balaclava) baraclava for $20.

You were a smart kid and never had to really study probably. Things just came to you. A little review was all you needed to ace classes. Those days are over. To put this in perspective, I'm going to guess you do alright on most assignments and projects. When you attend class, you probably can follow what's going on and understand it. When you look at a problem and \"walk yourself through it\" you get it perfectly. But when exam time comes, you hit road blocks and bomb an exam or two.... why? \n",

      "You can imagine there are approximately three different tiers of knowledge for any given subject you'll face. There is (1) Novelty, (2) Familiarity, and (3) Understanding.

      "Here's the hard truth though: **being 100% familiar with a subject means nothing about your understanding of that subject**. Read that a few times over. You can go to class, do all of your assignments, and then bomb tests. This is because thousands of people around the world mistakenly assume that because they are familiar on a subject, they understand it. **WRONG**.  Tests look at your understanding of a subject and not your familiarity with it. So if you don't get to the understanding level, you're S.O.L. on exams and will waste countless hours \"studying\" and still under achieving. \n",
      "\n",
      "Fortunately, getting to the understanding level is relatively easy with one specific change to your habits. When you're studying, **you need to persistently test yourself without any mental aids**. Attempt problems without notes, solution sets, or even the book. If you're prepping for an exam or a quiz or even doing homework, take a swipe at multiple problems without the help of notes, books, or solution sets. This forces you to come face-to-face with the areas where you lack understanding. Almost anyone (especially in Cornell Engineering) can walk themselves through a problem with notes or a book or follow a lecture. Not as many can be given a problem and without notes/book/solutions create a solution. By testing yourself on what you'll be tested on, you'll be able to immediately hone in on areas where you may be familiar with a subject but not understand it and focus studying habits there. Without doing this simple step, you'll spend days of your college life chasing your tail. I promise. This is the hard truth about studying. It doesn't sound fun, but do it and you will be amazed at how much more strongly you perform and how much lower the pressure will feel. \n",

      "When I was a MechE, average GPA was a 2.9-3.0, and an honors required a 3.2.  Usually you graduate with a major GPA in that range, then your liberal arts classes bring your GPA up into the low 3s, and that's what you put on your resume when you graduate.  Its different by major though.\n",

      "A lot.  Honestly, if I could go through it again, I would do the following:  the night before class, read the chapter the class is on.  Take notes during the class, but since you've already paid attention to the material, try and understand it.  Use the homework to make sure you understand it.  That will help when studying for the exams, which you should probably leave a ~week for, and study a bit each day.  Buy a calendar at some point early in the semester, and mark down when all your exams / homework / projects are due, this can help you figure out when you need to start studying/reviewing for each class.  But honestly, I wouldn't worry about this.  You'll start figuring it out your first semester.  Everyone's in the same boat together, and you'll know a bunch of people in your classes, by virtue of being a freshman.  You all will figure it out together, and your first few tests will calibrate it for you.  *shrug.\n",

      "&gt; How difficult is the engineering workload? \n",
      "\n",
      "The hardest part of the engineering workload is the engineering workload culture.  If I could give only one piece of advice to every new freshman, this would be it.  You're entering a world class university.  When you graduate, you will literally be able to fly to most countries around the world and land a job based on the name of the university alone.  That means you're probably a pretty high caliber person (whether you know it or not), and you're entering a school with a lot of such people.  There's a real culture in the engineering school to push people to work really, really hard.  Part of it is people want to say \"engineering is so hard, blah blah blah\".  Part of it is professors who try to look tough (there are some in every university, and some on this forum).  Some of it is there are just a lot of students that have never been intellectually challenged before, and are excited by the prospect, or are trying to get through in less time.  Regardless, it breeds a little bit of a culture where people will brag about how many credits they're taking each semester.  IGNORE IT.  Take your standard 4 classes (16 credits) each semester, and no more.  If you want to throw on a writing seminar, or gym class, or project team, go for it, those things are fun, and some of the project teams are real resume builders.  But that's it.  Don't take 5 real classes.  If you take 20+ credits a semester, you're going to spend all your time studying, and your life is going to suck.  A large part of the point of college is the people you meet and become life long friends with.  If you take the normal 4, you'll spend time learning, but you'll have free time to hang out with people, play games, go to parties, play a sport, whatever you want to do that makes things fun for you, and if you need to spend extra time bringing your grades up in a class that seemed more difficult than you thought, you'll have the free time to dedicate.  Life is all about balance, its easier to learn this the easy way.  Not to mention you should always leave yourself some free time just in case life throws you a curveball anyway, because if there's one thing life likes to do, its to throw things at you that you weren't expecting.  And remember, you don't have to prove anything to anybody; you're there to learn and have fun.\n",

First snow is usually over thanksgiving break, the next snow in December.  So if you're (un)lucky, you might not get any fall semester.  Spring semester there'll be snow for the majority of it, but you learn how to dress warm.  Occasionally the wind will bite your face a little bit, but that's about the worst of it.\n",

The hard part, honestly, can be finding it.  Unlike many other universities, Cornell is _not_ centralized.  If you don't explicitly look for what you're interested in, and put real effort into finding people / clubs / classes / places that do that activity, you won't find it.  Its just the nature of a large spread out university.  But it is there, and its important that you find such cliques to have a good college experience.  But this is more advice for your sophmore year and later, your freshman year you're going to be meeting so many new people running around in such large groups of people I wouldn't worry about this at all.\n",

Its the easiest time to meet people of the entire collegiate experience.  Other than that, just have fun!  College is fun.  Even engineering is fun.  And if it isn't fun, go choose something else that you find to be fun.  Learning should come with passion, and you're entering one of the few places in the country where literally any effort you put into any aspect of your life will yield huge dividends beyond what you can image.  Go celebrate the rest of your senior year, and work hard / have fun when you get there.  You're there for yourself, no one else.\n",

AEP majors have a couple more math classes they are required to take, which are extremely advanced, but many Physics majors *will* take them anyways if they’re taking honors level classes after quantum.

      "Physics concentration requires 15 credits, 11 of which must be 3000+. There is a caveat to this; you can’t use classes that are counting towards another major’s requirements. So you have three options here:\n",
      "\n",
      "1: Stick with a concentration\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the easiest option. You can count 2110/1110/2800 as your non-3000+ 4 credits, and then take three 3000+ classes. This will probably be 3110, 3410, and some other elective. This gives you a good foundation, and probably plenty of experience to work as an entry-level code monkey. You’ll gain the skills to do research-level programming and general understanding of computers and their internal software. \n",

      "This is like 1-2 more classes than the concentration. You’ll gain enough experience to pursue independent learning and might consider going all out and getting the major in your sophomore year or something. If you’re considering getting the minor, you might find a bunch of different courses you suddenly want to take after 3110 when you’re looking at your list of options for the 3000+ level electives just to get a bit more experience in shit like ML or AI.  \n",

      "3: Major in both because I hate myself\n",
      "\n",
      "The difference between this and the minor is substantially greater than the minor and its concentration. The CS major on its own is not too bad, but since none of your concentration classes will be able to count towards your major, you either have to take 4 extra CS classes for a total of 7 CS electives (which is a lot by the way) or you concentrate in something else, and end up taking 4+ more courses in a different subject anyway. \n",
      "\n",
      "You’ll need to take all the courses in the minor and two more core classes: CS 4110, and CS4820, as well as 3 technical classes (these can just be physics classes), a stats class, and a practicum (just a project class, ranges from easy as shit to hellish nightmare). Its a doable schedule, but will require some credit scraping so you can avoid bullshit classes with AP and doubling up some of your CAS reqs with classes like Intro to Asian Religion. \n",

      "\n",
      "That’s not really true at all. Cornell’s engineering physics program is considered to be one of the hardest on the planet, usually cited as top 3/5, only surpassed by MIT/CalTech. Lots of employers know the meat grinder that is AEP and will simply assume you can take on most challenging environments and subjects. \n",

      "Plenty of AEP students go into a masters program afterward, but it is more common for Physics majors. It would also be a bit of a waste of time, taking a bunch of classes that would be irrelevant for grad school. However, if you’re asking if doing AEP would hurt your chances of getting into a grad school, it probably wouldn’t make a difference. Your grades will probably be a bit worse than if you had done Physics, which grad schools will look at, but might consider. \n",

      "\n",
      "**What does it mean to be a member of CGSU?**\n",
      "\n",
      "A CGSU member is someone who wants to build power for graduate workers at Cornell, and has signed a CGSU Membership Card (in-person or online). Members of the union get updates about the union organizing drive and invitations to membership meetings, as well as information on how to get more involved. When CGSU makes a big strategic decision, elects members of our Steering Committee, or votes on a collective bargaining agreement, only members can vote on that. Being a member of CGSU is about showing your support for your colleagues, and having a say in your union.\n",
      "\n",
      "**What could a union, and a union contract, do for me as a graduate student?**\n",
      "\n",
      "A union, and the ability to negotiate a contract, means having tangible control over your own working conditions. Right now, graduate students have no meaningful control over University policies. The University can change stipend rates, healthcare benefits, and hour expectations without consulting graduate students. With a union, graduate students could negotiate over the substance of many University policies, and secure them through having a contract. This contract would be legally enforceable.\n",
      "\n",
      "A union is also a resource center for graduate students. Right now, there is very little done by the University to ensure that graduate students understand their rights as workers. This means that many graduate students don’t know what policies guide their working lives, from sick days and vacation days to programs like the childcare grant. Unions work to ensure that every worker knows what rights they have, and how to make sure that the contract is followed and their rights are protected, because a union is only as strong as its membership. If a graduate student feels like the University has treated them unfairly, the union will help (and is currently helping) grads to explore their options and navigate these processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "**What will a union prevent me from doing?**\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a question you might hear from the administration to make you think that you will have limited autonomy within a union. But a union contract is bargained by graduate students, with the administration. CGSU will never put limits on graduate students’ rights and conditions, because it works for grads. CGSU will make an effort to limit the University’s ability to change policies without grad students’ input and consent.\n",
      "\n",
      "**What is a “bargaining unit”, and am I in it?**\n",
      "\n",
      "The bargaining unit is the group of graduate students covered directly within the scope of contract negotiations. The bargaining unit was decided in an agreement between the University and CGSU in May, 2016, and includes all Teaching Assistant, Research Assistant, and Graduate Assistant positions under University Policy 1.3. This does not include hourly workers, nor does it include students on Fellowships (although we fought the University hard on both of these issues).\n",
      "\n",
      "Every graduate student in the bargaining unit will be able to vote in the upcoming recognition election, and will be covered under any contract that is negotiated between CGSU and the University. We know that graduate students will move in and out of the bargaining unit during their time at Cornell. However, regardless of your job title, if you have signed a union card, you are considered a member of the union, and can participate as much as you see fit.\n",
      "\n",
      "**What’s this election I’ve been hearing about?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Before a union can negotiate with administration and bargain a contract, it needs to be “recognized”. Cornell could have recognized CGSU on its own, but did not, instead calling for a “recognition election”. This is where graduate students in the bargaining unit get to vote YES or NO to being represented by CGSU as a union. If a majority vote YES, then the University has agreed to recognize CGSU as the union representing Cornell grads and begin bargaining a contract with us.\n",
      "\n",
      "**I’m an international student. Can I join CGSU? Are there any problems I will face because I am on a visa?**\n",
      "\n",
      "As an international student you are afforded all of the protections American citizens have when it comes to organizing and unionizing. Your visa will not be jeopardized by being a CGSU member. As a union member, you’ll also be part of an organization that will stand with you if you face any issues at the University.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why did the union subpoena my information?**\n",
      "\n",
      "We have an agreement with the administration that’s designed to ensure a smooth process over the coming months, and as part of that agreement, the administration agreed to release contact info so that we can reach out and talk to everyone who might be affected. The administration asked for the subpoena before they would release that information.\n",
      "\n",
      "To make this a truly democratic process, we need to be sure we give every one of our fellow co-workers the opportunity to inform this process and tell us how they would like to improve working conditions at Cornell. The University already has the ability to contact all grad students to dissuade us from unionizing, we have the legal right to be afforded the same opportunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "**What are union dues?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Union dues are money paid by members of the union for the purpose of maintaining a strong union. Collecting dues is one more way to ensure that graduate workers can have a strong union that can win a good contract and defend the rights of grad students. That’s what dues money is used for–winning and maintaining a good contract, and continuing to organize a strong union of grads that will have real power at Cornell and beyond.\n",
      "\n",
      "The campaign for recognition at Cornell is funded by the dues of union members in New York and across the country. Once we win our contract and have a union local, dues will sustain our union’s activities and service our contract!\n",
      "\n",
      "**So, how much do union dues cost?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Right now, there are no dues, and no cost. Once we win recognition from the University, and negotiate a contract, CGSU members will decide how much dues will be. That’s a decision we make, democratically, as members, and that as a member, you could make too. Union dues do not usually exceed 2% of total compensation.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Do you have any specific numbers on dues?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes! Again, right now, there are no dues. However, below is a table detailing the current NYSUT/AFT dues for 2016-17, that more than 600,000 AFT/NYSUT members pay.\n",
      "\n",
      "nysut-aft-dues-schedule\n",
      "\n",
      "**But I don’t want to pay any extra money!**\n",
      "\n",
      "We don’t want you to, either. A contract would never be bargained, much less approved by members, that didn’t ensure that we get more in compensation than go to dues. It would defeat a big part of what unions seek to do: to improve the material circumstances of its members.\n",
      "\n",
      "**I’m worried that my stipend will be cut to pay for others’ raises–will it?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Why would you vote to cut your own pay? We have people involved from a wide variety of fields such as Electrical Engineering, Physics, Biomedical Engineering, Anthropology and English. A democratic union like ours reflects the will of its membership, and no one is trying to pit some fields against others. This is about making improvements that benefit everyone and make it possible for us to do our best teaching and research work possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "**We already have GPSA (Graduate and Professional Student Assembly), so why would we need a union?**\n",
      "\n",
      "GPSA is an important part of Cornell’s shared governance system, and we’re not trying to replace that. But we think that concerns around our working conditions, benefits, and compensation are more appropriately addressed through a union, which has a stronger legal framework to negotiate and hold the administration accountable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, there are many grads that seek support navigating Cornell’s grievance policies. Having a union assures that grads will have the representation they need to navigate this onerous process, while working to improve it and bargain a more just system of due process for grad workers at Cornell.\n",
      "\n",
      "**My field is unique and we don’t want a cookie cutter approach.**\n",
      "\n",
      "Our goal as union members isn’t to conform every department and field to one exact way of operating. Rather, we want to be able to set baseline standards and expectations–and departmental administrators and faculty can figure out the best ways to meet them!

      "* Go to class. Every single fucking class. And study. Most of the stress people end up having is from not doing well. The stress of studying is easy in comparison.\n",
      "* Find out what kind of worker you are: I'm only effective with lots of structure and scheduling, and deadlines to keep me on track. I didn't learn that until after I made a really stupid, lazy roster. Take the first semester to learn how to be effective, and apply it the rest of your 4 years.\n",
      "* Be smart about how much you can reasonably handle per semester. Yes, you're a full time student, but you need time to unwind, too.\n",
      "* If you are a gamer, your room is the WORST place to study. Go outside, or to a library, or to CTB, or anywhere. Just not in front of your computer and its sweet, sweet Counterstrike.\n",
      "* Learn to swim over the summer if you don't know already. CU actually has really fun gym class options, and it sucks to have to spend a semester learning how to swim when you can be rock climbing/pistol shooting/archery-ing/riding horses instead.\n",

      "**Social Stuff**\n",
      "\n",
      "* At orientation, you'll lots of people. It's exciting. One of them may even touch your boner (or lady boner). So, be friendly - but also be realistic. Finding people you click with takes effort, so yes, you have to put your best foot forward and get out there, but that doesn't mean latching onto the first person who tolerates you. Be upbeat, have something to offer everyone, and really feel people out from the perspective of whether you really enjoy spending your time with them.\n",
      "* Talk to everyone. You don't have to be best friends with everyone, but introduce yourself. Ask them about what they like. Listen. You're going to meet people from places you've never been who grew up in ways you never did. Learn and, when possible, have fun with them.\n",
      "* Start a dinner group. Even just two people. It's therapeutic.\n",
      "* DO NOT HAVE YOUR FIRST DRUNKEN EXPERIENCE WITH PEOPLE YOU HAVEN'T KNOWN LONG ENOUGH TO TRUST WITH YOUR LIFE. Teenagers have no fucking clue on how to take care of a drunk. So, yeah, have a drink or two, but don't give into shot pressure if you know you suck at drinking (or have no idea how much you can drink). Also, medical amnesty - if you pass out, call the fucking EMTs. People die when they ignore this.\n",
      "* When you first throw up and get your first hangover, don't be the dick who says \"I'm never drinking again.\" Just suck it up, drink some gatorade, brush your teeth and walk it of. Your liver will be taking much more punishment in the next four years.\n",
      "* I found that the best way to meet people I clicked with was through activities - so make sure you check out the club fairs, and try a lot of things out the first couple weeks. After that, stick around for what ACTIVITY you enjoy most. Trust me, you'll build much stronger friendships if you follow your passion, rather than just joining something because the people seem cool to you.\n",

      "* Be a person of your word. Be prepared to split chores, and even do some things that you dislike, because your roommate will also be doing things he or she dislikes. It beats being passive aggressive and hating the hours you have to spend in your room because you're not allowed to sleep anywhere else.\n",
      "* That said, even when your roommate situation is great, less time in your room is best for everyone who lives there.\n",
      "* Sexile is not completely off-limits as long as you call ahead, and make it worth your roommate's while. He or she will be doing you a solid, so either be prepared to reciprocate in some way or don't do it.\n",
      "* It's not where you live, it's what you make of it. I know more people who are still friends/in touch from Donlon 6 today than from any other dorm I've ever heard of.\n",
      "* On that note, just because you're living in the same building as someone doesn't make it more likely for you to end up as good friends. Hang around people because you like them not because it's easy.\n",
      "* If you piss on the seat, clean it, or vigilante justice IS warranted. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Dating**\n",
      "\n",
      "* This is for guys and girls. Don't rush into or out of relationships. College is a different ball field, yes, but that doesn't mean you should just go all in or all out. This is one of the few times in your life when it's really completely cool to just be unattached - where no one will be in your business and making you feel like an asshole or a slut for dating lots of people (okay, some people may still do that. But, none of them is writing you a paycheck, so fuck 'em). At the same time, don't just bail on a good situation just because you can. You'll stunt your growth in relationships in either extreme.\n",
      "* For the love of god, people, if someone wants to spend time with you, they will make it as easy as possible. If you have to call someone 5 times for them to even answer, they don't wanna hang out with you, holmes. Sorry.\n",
      "* Nice clothes (non-college bum couture) goes a pretty long way in making you noticeable.\n",
      "* Never, ever date someone just because the sex is good. Make that person a FWB. And don't be ashamed of that arrangement. It's actually kind of awesome.\n",
      "* If you're a virgin, it's cool. Lots of people willing to let you practice.\n",
      "* If you want to stay a virgin, that's cool too. There are lots of people who are doing the same thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Cornelliana that I personally really loved**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Go to your corny floor events. Go to the corny dances. Go to all of the things, at least to stop by and see it. You'll miss it after you've graduated.\n",
      "* Go gorge jumping. There's only a short period of time when it's actually warm enough on campus to do. Make sure you a) know how to swim, and b) are with someone who knows how to get to the jump points.\n",
      "* You gotta go to at least ONE frat party. I'm a party animal, and even then frat parties weren't my thing (too many people I didn't know) - but I never would have known that and then learned to throw my own parties if I didn't try one.\n",
      "* Risley is pretty fuckin' cool. If they still have it, ask about pool. Or a Balch run. Also, go to at least one Rocky Horror picture show.\n",
      "* Cornell cinema regularly shows films that you might never see anywhere else. Check it out.\n",
      "* Buy an article of Cornell clothing. There are so many of us in the world that I'm always surprised by how much Cornell gear I see out there - instant connection. \n",

      "I would like to write my first Performance Review about a play which I saw only a few hours ago. It was truly inspiring, and although great writers say that you should let your nerves calm before trying to write about something, I think writing it now will better capture the enthusiasm for which I think this play deserves.  \n",
      "First, since this play was directed, acted, and produced by members of the Actors Workshop of Ithaca, I think that they deserve a collective congratulations as this was the best play I have ever seen. If not for a hand full of movies it would be the best performance piece ever as well, but against the millions of dollars that Hollywood throws around like candy, and with completely local talent, the Actors Workshop has exceeded expectations once again and has displayed that the community of theater is alive and well. \n",
      " \n",
      " \n",
      "At the begining of the play we are given a scene of Mitizi and her boyfriend, Chuck played by the incredible Darryle W. Johnson Jr., as they discover (by way of a store-bought pregency test) that Mitzi is infact pregnent. A mysterious and wonderfully pessimistic spirit, played by the powerful Deirdre Levine, watches on silently from the corner of the room as the couple become estatic. As the soon to be father grows more and more excited however, Mitzi slowly becomes concerned. The changes in emotion throughout this scene are professional level quality. Each is seemless, and is subtle enough to be exactingly realistic while still dramatic enough so that each movement shows intention and shows that the character is very clearly making a choice. \n",
      "It is here that the play becomes decidedly more than a typical play. As Ms. Levine rises from her corner we see that she is dressed in clothing from the past, perhaps in the style of victorian poverty. As she speaks we get a sense of the character instantly, and it is obvious that Ms. Levine plays an Irish drunk perfectly. We can see why her character is named Reckless Mary. Mary spends most of the play foreshadowing the grim nature of things to come, but in each case it is a mystery if she is right due to some supernatural ability to see into the future, or if Reckless Mary is simply less naive then the rest of us. Reckless Mary does not seem like the kind of spirit who would want to let us know. The subject matter is for much of the play to follow, as dark and serious as the title suggests. But I must give the author credit, for aside from the moments so intensly focused on the main topic, there is an entire other realm of day-to-day life which seems to shove its head into the face of our protagonist, Mitzi, played by the charming and talented Dayna Joan. While those who have not seen the play might consider it unfitting for a play about abortion to include light hearted jokes in nearly every other scene, these jokes are in good taste, and only make the audience see the stark contrast between the rest of the world we live in and the dark reality that Mitzi sees infront of her.\n",
      " \n",
      " \n",
      "Before I go on, I must give further credit to the author, Elizabeth Heffron, which is fully deserved. The title is striking. Perhaps too much so, as I'm sure it offends some who would be swayed by the play itself. Nevertheless, the author is very good at fleshing out each character one by one as the story progressed. The writing allowed each actor to display their point of view on the controversial issue. \n",
      " \n",
      "The plot which was crafted by Heffron but clearly driven farther by the director, C.A. Teitelbaum, assistant director, Masa Gibson, and each actor in the seven person cast. The characters are so deep and well rounded that there is no doubt each actor spent hours of work outside of the rehersals, considering how their characters would view the relationships and decisions which are made throughout the play.  \n",
      " \n",
      "Supporting actor Mr. Johnson plays two other characters during the play in addition to Chuck. The variety that this actor has is simply incredible. Each character is very different from the other two, and his second character delivers monologue upon monologue of educational facts. A college professor, dubbed in the program as \"The Expert\", gives us two or three lectures which contain facts all of which are both unbiased, and useful  to those of us who wish to find a meaningful answer to the abortion debate. The writer pokes fun at the ego of those forged by Acadamia however, as The Expert peridoically flys into hilarious fits of rage, yelling into his cellphone about personal bussiness mid-lecture.\n",
      " \n",
      "The play showscases 15 different characters divided amoung the 7 actors, and each character represents a different face of society. Although not all characters are as likable as others, each character has about equal time to shine and the play is fair in showing both sides of the debate surrounding one of the the darkest questions of our time: \"Is abortion ever ethical?\".\n",
      " \n",
      "It is important to point out that our protagonist Mitzi does not want an abortion. She despritely wants to have the little baby boy who is growing inside of her. The case discussed in this play is very specifically centered the ethical questions of what to do when there are unthinkable consequences for a pregnecy to go full term.\n",
      " \n",
      "The excellent Daniel A.P. Taylor and a visiting alumni of the workshop, Ria Burns-Wilder play Tim and Nita, respectively. Both characters are part of the LGBT community, who bring up persuasive arguements from both sides of the debate. Both do a spectacular job in their scene together, and I was enthralled by their connection with one another on stage.\n",
      " \n",
      "The most touching scene however was not revealed until the end when the mother, Verna, played by Kristin Sad develivers a must-see monologue which ripped my heart in half. Three supporting characters are played Aleck Osinski. He is able to bring life to each of these three challenging roles, and plays them in a way that significantly ads to rest of the casts performance. Most impressive however was ability to summon conviction and channel it through his otherwise stoic character, Dr. Block, who decides to help the protagonist by any means nessicary. \n",
      " \n",
      "To top everything off, this magnificant play is performed in the midst of a fabulously designed set, lights, and atmosphere complete with well selected music to fit the themes between each scene. So thank you to Abby Smith, Joey Moro, Katie Spallone and the rest of the Crew under the direction of Jeff Hodge, stage manager. \n",

This isn't weird, it's actually kind of cool, and it makes for a smaller, tight-knit community instead of a big dorm experience. However, if you're not in one of the program houses (JAM for musicians, Ujamaa for african-american cultural living, HILC for international students) it can be sort of isolating. I personally lived in JAM my first year, and it was a blast, but it's very hit or miss - it really depends on how social the average JAMmie is that year. My year, it was great, but I hear that this year there're a lot of awkward folks in there. One downside is that they're really far from Central Campus.\n",

O-Week is a time like none other. Enjoy it. Go to the events, don't party at the frats or in collegetown. You only get to go through it as a Freshman once. Make friends with EVERYONE you meet.

You still have to enroll through your jtf.cornell.edu account, but Chequerd will help you visualize it and figure out what you WANT before it's time to enroll. Some people will tell you about a site called Schedulizer that does roughly the same thing, but Chequerd works way better. It's just not as well known. \n",

It's easy - your grade is based on 4 papers and participation, just make sure those are good and then you're all set - and the material is interesting and fun.

      "Ok everyone. You might have heard bad things about the weather, have experienced northern cold once or twice, or you might just question \"how bad could it be?\" Here's the answer you're looking for. I'll try to give you the actual numbers, the intuition of how cold works and how to fight it, and recommendation and rules for buying clothes.\n",
      "\n",
      "**1) [Click Here For the Weather Data](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=weather+in+14850+in+2014)** (you can change the 14850 to your zip code to compare.)\n",
      "\n",
      "**2) Here is my commentary on the weather data:** Cornell weather is not that bad for most people along the northern border of the U.S. It can get down to -10 F (last year it hit -17) but there are only a few weeks when you're below 10 degrees F. Windchill a little worse. Cornell is in a flat section of the state and that means lots of wind, but not as much as any costal town or city. This means windchill can be a factor. At the end of the day, anyone from NYC or Chicago would be fine at Cornell. Cornell only gets such a bad name because it has a big campus and attracts many students from far away who are woefully unprepared.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3) Here is my description of how cold weather works:** I think this is important. Numbers are meaningless without the ability to interpret them. I know the idea of sub-zero is foreign to some, but truthfully, it just means more layers. I'm not going to go off on a talk about air pockets. Instead let me talk about what it takes to feel comfortable, to feel warm. First, no individual body part can be cold. Second, the body cannot feel its core temperature dropping.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ok, what this means is if any part of your body is exposed to cold objects that *conduct heat* away from you body quickly then that body part is going to feel cold. Things such as carrying books without gloves, walking in thin shoes (*especially* if they're wet, oh god water is a good conductor of heat), or wind on exposed skin will suck the heat from those parts of the body. This makes them feel cold. What that means for you is three things: boots, gloves, hat.\n",
      "\n",
      "But here's the truth about all of this: you are a big bag of circulating water. Your body is more than happy to just throw heat at your hands to keep the tissue at normal temperature. It's more than capable of it as well. The problem is that when your body feels its core temperature dropping it panics and constricts blood flow to your extremities. It is willing to sacrifice some heat in the hands (or feet, or nose) to try to conserve as much heat in the torso as possible. This means the hands get cold and causes pain. A lot of times you'll see someone with gloves on talking about how cold their hands are, cursing the gloves, while someone right next to them isn't wearing gloves and feels fine. The difference is that person has warmer clothes around their legs and torso, and that means the body has excess heat to throw at the hands. Another big things that make a difference is movement/exercise. Walking in the sun vs sitting in the shade can be the difference of 15 to 20 degrees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Try this experiment sometime. Pick up an ice cube. That is literally all you have to do. Roll it around in your hand and feel how it doesn't make your hands hurt. That is because—and I'm going to get kinda patriotic in a \"the human body is awesome\" kind of way—that little piece of crystalized H20 does't have *crap* on the thousands of miles of intricate water circulation system dedicated to keeping that patch of tissue exactly the temperature it should be at. If you can make your torso *hot*, then only 10 degrees or below weather *with* a windchill will be strong enough cause real discomfort to exposed skin.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4) Here is a discussion on clothes:** Truth be told, this question is better answered in terms of what you need to wear. If you are prepared, you feel the same in the dead of winter at Cornell as you do in fall at Texas, just with more clothes on. As the Swedes say: \"there is no such thing as bad weather, just bad clothing.\" This does not mean you need to spend a lot on clothes. There are a lot of ways to design a warm winter wardrobe, but here are some of the basics.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, there are three different kinds of layers: the wicking layer, the warmth layer, and the weather layer. Wicking is just what goes on your skin or near it. It should be breathable and *wick* (pull) moisture (such as sweat) away from your skin. I really don't pay attention to this. I'm a Boy Scout so on weekend long campouts it's important, otherwise t-shirt and underwear is fine. Second is warmth. This can be a fancy parka or jacket, or just a sweater (for the legs it is long underwear). Third is weather, and this means wind and water protection. You do not want water or wind pulling heat directly from your torso! When implemented it looks like this: underwear, t-shirt, winter jacket. The winter jacket has both warm and weather built into one. If you need more warmth, add a sweater, then long underwear, then another sweater.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other things to think about:\n",
      "\n",
      "* You have to be careful about being able to take off layers. Too much and you'll be too warm inside. That's why I have a few different jackets depending on the weather, because ideally you want to be able to take off only your outside layer and be cool enough indoors. I avoid long underwear because of this (if I can). I have a light jacket for fall and a heavy parka for winter, that I can unzip if I'm too hot and take off once inside.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Boots are a big one when snow hits. They prevent wet (and thus, cold) feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Face masks are great for the worst months. I really recommend a balaclava hood. It is a scarf and hat in one, with a face mask that can be pulled up to cover the nose and mouth. If you wear glasses make sure you get one that has holes/thin fabric in front of the mouth to prevent it from fogging up.\n",
      "\n",
      "* I highly recommend any gloves you get have a wind blocking layer. Otherwise they are basically just swiss cheese. Sure they're warm in still air, but add a breeze and they might as well be in your pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Cotton and wool are warmer than most synthetic material, so if you are looking for a hoodie or sweater as an intermediary pick those when in doubt. Note: they suck with wind resistance without other fibers mixed in or special treatments. Coats are often measured in a goose down number. I never understood the details, but basically it means the coat is as warm as a certain packing of goose feathers. You will see \"goose down 600\". The higher the number, the warmer, on a roughly linear scale.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5) Specific clothes to buy:** For the benefit of people who've never shopped cold weather gear before, I'll post some specific products and links. For the most part, I'm posting frugal buys that will get you through the rough of winter. Feel free to dismiss items that don't appeal to you, this is only a set of examples.\n",
      "\n",
      "* LLBean is a great company IMHO that has tremendous warranties, prices, customer support, and everything from them is machine washable. Click [here](http://www.llbean.com/llb/search/?freeText=winter+jacket&amp;init=1) for some of their jackets. I would recommend a Jacket that goes down to -25 degrees F from them (because you don't want to have to rely on wearing long underwear and a sweater, as they assume with those ratings). My fav is the [Weather Challenger 3-in-1 Jacket](http://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/83559?feat=3%20in%201-SR0&amp;page=weather-challenger-3-in-1-jacket).\n",
      "\n",
      "* Other options for coats on a budget are surplus military stock. They have no military markings, are made to be stylus in a plan way, durable, and very functional. Two example sites are [Army Surplus World](http://www.armysurplusworld.com/display.asp?subDepartmentID=276) and [Army Navy Outfitters](http://www.armynavydeals.com/asp/Default.asp?). Crappy websites but good products.\n",
      "\n",
      "* You want a good pair of warm walking boots. Mickey Mouse boots are a name given to a particular type of boots used by the U.S. military. They often have ugly yellow text on them, but that's only if you look at them up close and for as cheap as $20 from [here](http://stores.alleghenywholesale.com/usgi-military-bata-black-mickey-mouse-boots-w-valve-20f-brand-new/) they deserve a mention.\n",
      "\n",
      "* [These gloves](http://www.mechanix.com/cold-weather). They are a little annoying because of the logo, but Mechanix Wear makes the most functional gloves out there. Just the $10 [Thermal Knit](http://www.mechanix.com/cold-weather/thermal-knit) will do you well.\n",
      "\n",
      "* If you don't wear glasses, buy [this](http://www.amazon.com/Chaos--CTR-Chinook-Balaclava-Windproof/dp/B002ZG7RFI/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1428097222&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=balaclava) baraclava for $20.

      "\n",
      "Other than that, a few comments (not an authoritative source):\n",
      "\n",
      " * Take at least one class every semester just for fun. It will remind you that learning used to be fun.\n",
      "\n",
      " * Never take an easier equivalent of a class (ie, econometrics for business majors vs. econometrics for econ majors).\n",
      "\n",
      " * Schedule light semesters around the weeder classes (you'll hear what they are. Usually CS211 or Org Chem).\n",
      "\n",
      " * Learn in class. Really pay attention, ask questions, take active notes (not just copying, but summarizing). Learn the Cornell Note Taking Method. Try to never have to study. Really.\n",
      "\n",
      " * Go to every class. You pay $100 an hour for instruction; don't waste it. You'll never catch up otherwise.\n",
      "\n",
      " * Get to know your professors outside of class. Office hours or department meetings or seminars are fantastic. Some of the best friendships you'll make in college will be with professors - and they'll serve you earliest as you look for jobs and opportunities. Being on good terms with the professor also makes it a lot easier to learn from them - a very strange but obvious mental shortcut.\n",
      "\n",
      " * Join a mastermind group or set one up. Keep each other accountable for each others goals. Assign each other deadlines for long-term projects so you don't cram at the end. Include personal goals too.\n",
      "\n",
      " * Try to join the Telluride Association. It's not a frat.\n",
      "\n",
      " * Learn how to get laid often (or, if a woman, learn how to get a guy to commit). Beyond the immediate benefit, it instills a confidence and charisma that will serve you as well as your education. Particularly if you're an engineer.\n",
      "\n",
      " * Learn a great theoretical foundation. Also learn at least two directly applicable trade skills that relies on that theory. Examples: Set Theory: SQL and Combinatorics. Do this for as many theoretical frameworks as you can. Applications pay off even in academia; very few get away with only knowing theory.\n",
      "\n",
      " * Focus on learning and education beyond grades. It's okay to get a bad grade if you're positive you got the lesson; horrible (though incredibly tempting) to get an easy A. This is not high school; grades here don't matter. Anything above failing is acceptable. Education does matter. Hell, find time to read books on subjects outside your major.\n",
      "\n",
      " * Make really good friends with people who seem respectable, admirable or successful to you. They'll last the rest of your life. The rest of your life is a really, really, REALLY long time. Choose wisely.\n",
      "\n",
      " * Learn enough about yourself that you can avoid the stress of evaluation, your limits, your fears. Learn to relax and things will come a lot easier. People will envy your ability to calmly walk in, take a test, and smile on the way out. They'll think you're a genius instead of someone who learns in class, gets enough sleep, and completes projects ahead of schedule. Learn that no amount of self-discipline, innate talent, inherent intelligence, or willpower is enough for this task. Learn to structure your life to support your work, or else it will overwhelm you.\n",
      "\n",
      " * Dance or sing or paint or do something creative so the right hemisphere of your brain doesn't completely collapse during engineering classes.\n",
      "\n",
      " * If you ever, ever start thinking about suicide, get help right away. It's super easy at Cornell, and even if for some reason it's not, it's the one thing that's worth fighting for. You're allowed to fail all your classes and get kicked out of school and have your parents disown you (hell, my friends who dropped out are doing better than many of my friends who went to graduate school), but you are not allowed to kill yourself. Ever. As one of my best friends said, \"If you kill yourself, I will so kick your ass.\"\n",

      "Word of advice, a high overall GPA isn't the only number they look at. Med school admissions will take into account your BCPM (bio, chem, physics, math) GPA as well as your non-science GPA. On average, matriculates tend to have a higher non-science GPA because they know they can inflate their overall GPA, but also know that the difference between the average applicant and matriculant's BCPM GPA is much higher than the non-science GPA, indicating that med school admissions teams know that the inflated overall GPA isn't the best indicator of preparation, and really look out for those types of students. \n",
      "\n",
      "While you can definitely be in a frat and party while being premed, that's nowhere near a good excuse for trying to be in an easier major. It's not like you're the first one with this idea to try and win a numbers game. If it comes down to say an English major and a BioE major with the same, high overall GPA, the BioE major will probably have more related coursework, have shown a much deeper interest in biology/medicine, and have demonstrated that they can handle a science heavy courseload and will probably be a stronger candidate. Speaking of this, med schools also like to see that you're challenging yourself and like to see medically related courses outside of the typical premed requirements. It's helpful if you can bring more talking points to an interview and impress them if you know about things outside of simply orgo like how to actually apply fundamental knowledge to healthcare. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also take into consideration that easy majors are very subjective. Do you enjoy writing research papers? doing case competitions? memorizing hundreds of facts? working on problem sets? writing proofs? writing code? networking? being an a lab? I would say, go for a major that you are genuinely interested in. This will help loads when it comes down to prelims and finals when you start to lose motivation. If you are invested in the material because you like it, you will generally also do better in the classes. If you find the \"easiest\" major, you will be inclined to do the bare minimum for an A (if that) with little educational value (something your Cornell tuition is supposed to be getting you). \n",
      "\n",
      "One very annoying thing about premeds, is their attitude of complaining about their coursework in an excessive way. While there are definitely easier classes than say biochem, there is a reason med schools want you to learn about the fundamentals of math and physics. It's frustrating that people see these as hurdles preventing them from getting into med school, when it's to make sure that students have the right foundation. If you are really treating your undergrad experience as a way to get into med school, you'll find yourself very disappointed when you don't get into your top choice. If you treat it as a learning experience to help prepare you for a job in the medical field, be it as a doctor or not, you will find yourself in a much better headspace. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you really want to be a doctor, you'll put in the necessary work to be a doctor. Whether it be through an \"easy\" major or not, that's up to you. But also keep in mind, that assuming you're a freshman, prelim season has just started, and you're still not taking the most difficult courses, you have no idea how your grades will hold up over the next several semesters. A 3.85+ may look good, but it's likely you won't be able to keep it that high if you don't work your ass off when you need to. What people don't seem to understand is that there are \"easy A\" classes, but that's in comparison to a course with a median of a B. There's an not insignificant number of people who don't put in the work and don't get A's. Take ILRies for example. They often get the short end of the stick when it comes to easy majors, but the truth is, they just have different work. Sure they're not forced to spend hours stuck in a basement lab or do problem sets extend miles beyond lecture or even take a real science class despite ending in a BS, but they do a hell of a lot more reading and writing than I could mentally handle. And at the end of the day, a lot of them still won't end up with an A. Prelaw ILR students are definitely there, definitely need a very high GPA to get into law school, and definitely have to work their asses off to make sure they maintain a high GPA despite being in an \"easy\" major, but what helps is that the coursework they're doing is relevant to the end goal they want to achieve, and that's how you should approach being premed. If you want to be a doctor, take courses that will help you be a better doctor in the future, not what you think will necessarily get you into the best med school out there. You're in college to prepare you for your future. Cornell doesn't have a sticker price of $60K+ a year for its students to party whenever they want. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you want to be a doctor from a purely financial standpoint, you won't enjoy your undergrad, you med school, your residency, your job, your life as much as if you want to practice medicines for a better reason. Money and the name of a higher tier medical school aren't everything. Premed requirements are there partly to help weed out these people. Also, assuming you can get into one of the best medical schools with just a high overall GPA is super presumptuous to begin with and is not really the goal of those people who just really want to be doctors not for the money. While it's good to set goals for yourself, it's not great to make them expectations. \n",

      "All this being said, it's very possible to have a social life while being a premed in a STEM major at Cornell (there are always some Cornell engineers in some of the arguably hardest majors who have demonstrated skill and desire who get into med school every year), but you really just need passion and the right drive to make it happen. \n",

      "I hate the Cornell Daily Sun with a burning passion so much, that nearly everyone who knows me in real life and who follows me on snapchat will likely consider that one of my personality traits. Here's a short list explaining why the Cornell Daily Sun is a fucking garbage publication: \n",
      "\n",
      "* It's not even daily, but they still call themselves the Cornell Daily Sun. Like what the fuck. \n",
      "\n",
      "* **Sex on Thursdays**. Who the fuck approved this? Whenever I post the headlines of this section on my snapchat, I always will get a reply from at least one person who refuses to believe that it's real. None of this shit is remotely interesting or even humorous, and it sure as fuck isn't classy. No one wants to fucking read stories about how this one person had a hookup with a dude and it turned awkward and she had to see him every day in Psych 1101 for the rest of the semester, every fucking week. What kind of middle school bullshit are you churning out? Every week its the three stories: Some gossippy bullshit about this girl kinda humble-bragging that she had sex this one time with a super hot dude and it wasn't great that leads into a tirade about how men can't make her orgasm but women can, a list of reasons why sex is fun (because this needed convincing) or why drunkenly hooking up with a laundry list of dudes isn't a bad thing, or another generic rant about rape culture. It just seems like the incoherent ramblings of an insecure bisexual who wants to make sure everyone else knows how much sex they have. \n",
      "\n",
      "* I'm taking a single bullet point to complain about a specific person's op-eds. I consider myself moderately liberal, but even taking into consideration that Cornell is a college, and a pretty liberal one at that, I couldn't take some of these articles seriously. Last year, there was literally an editorial written by a woman who was **complaining that when bouncers knew that she was underage and still let her into bars in collegetown, she felt indebted to them and argued this was sexist**, while acknowledging that there were nights when her guy friends were left at the door and her friends and she were let in. She went on to counter the argument to \"simply not drink underage\" by arguing that drinking was a part of college life, and she had a right to *break the law* to meet that goal. I don't think I'm even exaggerating that much, read it for yourself [here](https://cornellsun.com/2018/03/26/hubsher-can-i-see-your-i-d/). \n",
      "\n",
      "* The rest of the columns: A lot of these have the unique and distinctive style of *garbage fucking journalism*. Use of a bunch of buzzwords and phrases that may be independently coherent, but as a whole don't really say much. They're usually written intentionally over-provocative in attempts to make the author stand out and give themselves a sense of superiority. It reeks of modern YouTube/Vine \"look-at-me\" culture that I fucking abhor. Each of these \"texts\" is written with a tone of absolute disgust when its evident that they're actually completely ambivalent to the issue. Another lot of these have absolutely fucking nothing to do with Cornell, or really anything in general. I read some article the other day about some girl who got her credit card number stolen through some phishing scheme or something that played out like that one English paper I shat out in the class it was due freshman year of high school. Nothing was really written about how to avoid scams in the future or how to go about resolving a credit card dispute, or really anything of worth to the reader. Some girl just wrote about the one time she got her credit card number stolen, and then what she got for breakfast afterward or something. \n",
      "\n",
      "* Batshit crazy opinion pieces. There was an article last year written by 3 non-CS grad students that called for the CS department to introduce a Sociology/Diversity Requirement because they were worried about AI being racist. Here's a excerpt from the first paragraph of their article, \"It's August 4th, 2025, and the Chicago Police Department, now relying heavily on facial recognition artificial intelligence software, wrongly identifies and arrests Barack Obama.\" Does no one read these? A newspaper like The Cornell \"Daily\" Sun shouldn't be treated like Twitter, where anyone can say whatever the fuck they want. Someone needs to proof-read this shit before it gets sent to the presses. \n",
      "\n",
      "* The new columnists this year. I thought it would be better with most of the columnists I hate graduating in the spring of 2018. Boy I was fucking wrong. A lot of these new columnists are freshmen or sophomores. How these people got columns freshman year is beyond me; probably some kind of nepotism, especially when you read the kind of stuff they shit out. Basically every complaint I had about the rest of the columnists but taken to the absolute extreme. Like an extreme I didn't even know about. Even my high school paper in South Korea whose main contributors could barely speak English at a 7th grade level had better articles. Nothing interesting is discussed, anything that is discussed is taken to some political extreme, and a lot of opinion articles are written about events that are covered in a report article in the same issue of the paper. This may not seem like a huge deal, but it really is. Its tough to tell if an article about some event is meant to be a report or an opinion at first glance (especially if the opinion piece has the headline and the report doesn't), and it makes the whole paper seem ridiculously political at points and in bad taste. \n",
      "\n",
      "* The Movie section. I know art is subjective, but I happen to know a lot about the filmmaking industry. Not that I can make a good film myself, I just happen to have lots of sources where I can learn how films are made, the kinds of politics that go on behind blockbusters, what a director of cinematography looks for in cameras when trying to shoot a horror vs an action film, and why Casablanca is a great movie. But I can say with absolute certainty that nearly half the campus could be a better film critic than whoever they have at the \"Daily\" Sun. Constantly getting facts and general information wrong is just the tip of the iceberg. Also, in my opinion they all have terrible taste, but again, that's completely subjective. \n",
      "\n",
      "* Anti-Greek Life articles. I hate Greek Life roughly ten times more than the average Cornellian, but the number of articles complaining about Greek Life that all say the same fucking thing is ridiculous. If it was once a semester, or whenever some frat pulled some stupid stunt, I'd be okay, but every other fucking week is too much man. \n",
      "\n",
      "* The Sudoku Section. The quality of this thing fluctuates more than my cardiograph when The Cornell \"Daily\" Sun comes up in conversation. Some days they're ridiculously easy, some days they're actually difficult, usually the former.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I could rant about this for another ten thousand characters, but let's face it, no one read past this point so I'm gonna stop because I'm nearing the character limit for comments (also because I'm gonna fail my algo prelim on Thursday, and really need to stop procrastinating studying). \n",
      "\n",
      "But, I will give credit where credit is due. I think there are a couple of good writers on the team. I especially like DongYeon (Margaret) Lee's stuff because I think she raises questions that are remotely thought provoking, and makes arguments that are interesting and have actually have the capacity to change my mind. They also are always about life at Cornell instead of some fucking bullshit. Take a note other writers, because Cornell fucking deserves it already.  \n",

      "Ok everyone. You might have heard bad things about the weather, have experienced northern cold once or twice, or you might just question \"how bad could it be?\" Here's the answer you're looking for. I'll try to give you the actual numbers, the intuition of how cold works and how to fight it, and recommendation and rules for buying clothes.\n",
      "\n",
      "**1) [Click Here For the Weather Data](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=weather+in+14850+in+2014)** (you can change the 14850 to your zip code to compare.)\n",
      "\n",
      "**2) Here is my commentary on the weather data:** Cornell weather is not that bad for most people along the northern border of the U.S. It can get down to -10 F (last year it hit -17) but there are only a few weeks when you're below 10 degrees F. Windchill a little worse. Cornell is in a flat section of the state and that means lots of wind, but not as much as any costal town or city. This means windchill can be a factor. At the end of the day, anyone from NYC or Chicago would be fine at Cornell. Cornell only gets such a bad name because it has a big campus and attracts many students from far away who are woefully unprepared.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3) Here is my description of how cold weather works:** I think this is important. Numbers are meaningless without the ability to interpret them. I know the idea of sub-zero is foreign to some, but truthfully, it just means more layers. I'm not going to go off on a talk about air pockets. Instead let me talk about what it takes to feel comfortable, to feel warm. First, no individual body part can be cold. Second, the body cannot feel its core temperature dropping.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ok, what this means is if any part of your body is exposed to cold objects that *conduct heat* away from you body quickly then that body part is going to feel cold. Things such as carrying books without gloves, walking in thin shoes (*especially* if they're wet, oh god water is a good conductor of heat), or wind on exposed skin will suck the heat from those parts of the body. This makes them feel cold. What that means for you is three things: boots, gloves, hat.\n",
      "\n",
      "But here's the truth about all of this: you are a big bag of circulating water. Your body is more than happy to just throw heat at your hands to keep the tissue at normal temperature. It's more than capable of it as well. The problem is that when your body feels its core temperature dropping it panics and constricts blood flow to your extremities. It is willing to sacrifice some heat in the hands (or feet, or nose) to try to conserve as much heat in the torso as possible. This means the hands get cold and causes pain. A lot of times you'll see someone with gloves on talking about how cold their hands are, cursing the gloves, while someone right next to them isn't wearing gloves and feels fine. The difference is that person has warmer clothes around their legs and torso, and that means the body has excess heat to throw at the hands. Another big things that make a difference is movement/exercise. Walking in the sun vs sitting in the shade can be the difference of 15 to 20 degrees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Try this experiment sometime. Pick up an ice cube. That is literally all you have to do. Roll it around in your hand and feel how it doesn't make your hands hurt. That is because—and I'm going to get kinda patriotic in a \"the human body is awesome\" kind of way—that little piece of crystalized H20 does't have *crap* on the thousands of miles of intricate water circulation system dedicated to keeping that patch of tissue exactly the temperature it should be at. If you can make your torso *hot*, then only 10 degrees or below weather *with* a windchill will be strong enough cause real discomfort to exposed skin.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4) Here is a discussion on clothes:** Truth be told, this question is better answered in terms of what you need to wear. If you are prepared, you feel the same in the dead of winter at Cornell as you do in fall at Texas, just with more clothes on. As the Swedes say: \"there is no such thing as bad weather, just bad clothing.\" This does not mean you need to spend a lot on clothes. There are a lot of ways to design a warm winter wardrobe, but here are some of the basics.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, there are three different kinds of layers: the wicking layer, the warmth layer, and the weather layer. Wicking is just what goes on your skin or near it. It should be breathable and *wick* (pull) moisture (such as sweat) away from your skin. I really don't pay attention to this. I'm a Boy Scout so on weekend long campouts it's important, otherwise t-shirt and underwear is fine. Second is warmth. This can be a fancy parka or jacket, or just a sweater (for the legs it is long underwear). Third is weather, and this means wind and water protection. You do not want water or wind pulling heat directly from your torso! When implemented it looks like this: underwear, t-shirt, winter jacket. The winter jacket has both warm and weather built into one. If you need more warmth, add a sweater, then long underwear, then another sweater.\n",

      "* You have to be careful about being able to take off layers. Too much and you'll be too warm inside. That's why I have a few different jackets depending on the weather, because ideally you want to be able to take off only your outside layer and be cool enough indoors. I avoid long underwear because of this (if I can). I have a light jacket for fall and a heavy parka for winter, that I can unzip if I'm too hot and take off once inside.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Boots are a big one when snow hits. They prevent wet (and thus, cold) feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Face masks are great for the worst months. I really recommend a balaclava hood. It is a scarf and hat in one, with a face mask that can be pulled up to cover the nose and mouth. If you wear glasses make sure you get one that has holes/thin fabric in front of the mouth to prevent it from fogging up.\n",
      "\n",
      "* I highly recommend any gloves you get have a wind blocking layer. Otherwise they are basically just swiss cheese. Sure they're warm in still air, but add a breeze and they might as well be in your pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Cotton and wool are warmer than most synthetic material, so if you are looking for a hoodie or sweater as an intermediary pick those when in doubt. Note: they suck with wind resistance without other fibers mixed in or special treatments. Coats are often measured in a goose down number. I never understood the details, but basically it means the coat is as warm as a certain packing of goose feathers. You will see \"goose down 600\". The higher the number, the warmer, on a roughly linear scale.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5) Specific clothes to buy:** For the benefit of people who've never shopped cold weather gear before, I'll post some specific products and links. For the most part, I'm posting frugal buys that will get you through the rough of winter. Feel free to dismiss items that don't appeal to you, this is only a set of examples.\n",
      "\n",
      "* LLBean is a great company IMHO that has tremendous warranties, prices, customer support, and everything from them is machine washable. Click [here](http://www.llbean.com/llb/search/?freeText=winter+jacket&amp;init=1) for some of their jackets. I would recommend a Jacket that goes down to -25 degrees F from them (because you don't want to have to rely on wearing long underwear and a sweater, as they assume with those ratings). My fav is the [Weather Challenger 3-in-1 Jacket](http://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/83559?feat=3%20in%201-SR0&amp;page=weather-challenger-3-in-1-jacket).\n",

Two example sites are [Army Surplus World](http://www.armysurplusworld.com/display.asp?subDepartmentID=276) and [Army Navy Outfitters](http://www.armynavydeals.com/asp/Default.asp?). Crappy websites but good products.\n",

      "\n",

      "I would like to write my first Performance Review about a play which I saw only a few hours ago. It was truly inspiring, and although great writers say that you should let your nerves calm before trying to write about something, I think writing it now will better capture the enthusiasm for which I think this play deserves.  \n",
      "First, since this play was directed, acted, and produced by members of the Actors Workshop of Ithaca, I think that they deserve a collective congratulations as this was the best play I have ever seen. If not for a hand full of movies it would be the best performance piece ever as well, but against the millions of dollars that Hollywood throws around like candy, and with completely local talent, the Actors Workshop has exceeded expectations once again and has displayed that the community of theater is alive and well. \n",
      " \n",
      " \n",
      "At the begining of the play we are given a scene of Mitizi and her boyfriend, Chuck played by the incredible Darryle W. Johnson Jr., as they discover (by way of a store-bought pregency test) that Mitzi is infact pregnent. A mysterious and wonderfully pessimistic spirit, played by the powerful Deirdre Levine, watches on silently from the corner of the room as the couple become estatic. As the soon to be father grows more and more excited however, Mitzi slowly becomes concerned. The changes in emotion throughout this scene are professional level quality. Each is seemless, and is subtle enough to be exactingly realistic while still dramatic enough so that each movement shows intention and shows that the character is very clearly making a choice. \n",
      "It is here that the play becomes decidedly more than a typical play. As Ms. Levine rises from her corner we see that she is dressed in clothing from the past, perhaps in the style of victorian poverty. As she speaks we get a sense of the character instantly, and it is obvious that Ms. Levine plays an Irish drunk perfectly. We can see why her character is named Reckless Mary. Mary spends most of the play foreshadowing the grim nature of things to come, but in each case it is a mystery if she is right due to some supernatural ability to see into the future, or if Reckless Mary is simply less naive then the rest of us. Reckless Mary does not seem like the kind of spirit who would want to let us know. The subject matter is for much of the play to follow, as dark and serious as the title suggests. But I must give the author credit, for aside from the moments so intensly focused on the main topic, there is an entire other realm of day-to-day life which seems to shove its head into the face of our protagonist, Mitzi, played by the charming and talented Dayna Joan. While those who have not seen the play might consider it unfitting for a play about abortion to include light hearted jokes in nearly every other scene, these jokes are in good taste, and only make the audience see the stark contrast between the rest of the world we live in and the dark reality that Mitzi sees infront of her.\n",
      " \n",
      " \n",
      "Before I go on, I must give further credit to the author, Elizabeth Heffron, which is fully deserved. The title is striking. Perhaps too much so, as I'm sure it offends some who would be swayed by the play itself. Nevertheless, the author is very good at fleshing out each character one by one as the story progressed. The writing allowed each actor to display their point of view on the controversial issue. \n",
      " \n",
      "The plot which was crafted by Heffron but clearly driven farther by the director, C.A. Teitelbaum, assistant director, Masa Gibson, and each actor in the seven person cast. The characters are so deep and well rounded that there is no doubt each actor spent hours of work outside of the rehersals, considering how their characters would view the relationships and decisions which are made throughout the play.  \n",
      " \n",
      "Supporting actor Mr. Johnson plays two other characters during the play in addition to Chuck. The variety that this actor has is simply incredible. Each character is very different from the other two, and his second character delivers monologue upon monologue of educational facts. A college professor, dubbed in the program as \"The Expert\", gives us two or three lectures which contain facts all of which are both unbiased, and useful  to those of us who wish to find a meaningful answer to the abortion debate. The writer pokes fun at the ego of those forged by Acadamia however, as The Expert peridoically flys into hilarious fits of rage, yelling into his cellphone about personal bussiness mid-lecture.\n",
      " \n",
      "The play showscases 15 different characters divided amoung the 7 actors, and each character represents a different face of society. Although not all characters are as likable as others, each character has about equal time to shine and the play is fair in showing both sides of the debate surrounding one of the the darkest questions of our time: \"Is abortion ever ethical?\".\n",
      " \n",
      "It is important to point out that our protagonist Mitzi does not want an abortion. She despritely wants to have the little baby boy who is growing inside of her. The case discussed in this play is very specifically centered the ethical questions of what to do when there are unthinkable consequences for a pregnecy to go full term.\n",
      " \n",
      "The excellent Daniel A.P. Taylor and a visiting alumni of the workshop, Ria Burns-Wilder play Tim and Nita, respectively. Both characters are part of the LGBT community, who bring up persuasive arguements from both sides of the debate. Both do a spectacular job in their scene together, and I was enthralled by their connection with one another on stage.\n",
      " \n",
      "The most touching scene however was not revealed until the end when the mother, Verna, played by Kristin Sad develivers a must-see monologue which ripped my heart in half. Three supporting characters are played Aleck Osinski. He is able to bring life to each of these three challenging roles, and plays them in a way that significantly ads to rest of the casts performance. Most impressive however was ability to summon conviction and channel it through his otherwise stoic character, Dr. Block, who decides to help the protagonist by any means nessicary. \n",
      " \n",
      "To top everything off, this magnificant play is performed in the midst of a fabulously designed set, lights, and atmosphere complete with well selected music to fit the themes between each scene. So thank you to Abby Smith, Joey Moro, Katie Spallone and the rest of the Crew under the direction of Jeff Hodge, stage manager. \n",

      "•       First semester freshman students are not allowed to attend any form of fraternity or sorority sponsored event or activity, regardless of where it is hosted, if alcohol is present.  This includes, but is not limited to, “open parties.”\n",
      "•       Registered events as defined by the Cornell Greek Community’s Event Management Guidelines may continue to be conducted for members and appropriate guests according to Event Management Guidelines, University regulations, and state and federal laws. \n",
      "•       Recognizing that this will fundamentally shift what had become an unofficial recruitment process through social events, which went against the longstanding policy deferring recruitment to the second semester of a student’s freshman year, we will establish a four-quarter schedule so new students may become informed about fraternity and sorority life.\n",
      "When enacted by the Trustees, the amendment serves to align the University policy with those of national fraternities and sororities and the laws of the State of New York.  The amendment to the University’s Recognition Policy for Fraternities and Sororities provides explicit clarification for the University fraternity and sorority community by reiterating the University’s position and policy on these important matters.\n",
      "The University recognizes the efforts of student leaders who have striven to address the high risk behaviors of members; yet, experience shows that risk management through self-governance can fall short of compliance with the law and achieving required objectives without the additional guidance and support of alumni and the University.\n",
      "As a community we must work together to protect our organizations, the students who are members, the alumni who have given so much to preserve the positive experience of fraternity and sorority membership, and the students who seek to become members.  Also critical is the work we do to sustain and support the long tradition of exemplary behavior and values of our Cornell fraternity and sorority system.  Implementation of the amendments to the Recognition Policy requires that alcohol may not be provided, present, or part of any recruitment, education, or initiation process.  Practically speaking, we must alter the ways in which the social programs of our chapters are conducted to conform to the law and the new Trustee amendment.  Compliance by chapters will help alleviate the pressure, real or perceived, placed upon the fraternity and sorority system to serve as the primary social venue for all Cornell undergraduates and specifically for freshmen upon their initial entrance to the University community.   It also will significantly reduce liability by curtailing activities which are unlawful, unsafe, and are typically not covered by the chapter’s general liability insurance.\n",
      "Moreover, in the aftermath of the tragic death of George Desdunes this past spring, the Tri-Council agreed to advance implementation of the amendments.  The $25 million wrongful death suit filed against the Cornell local SAE Chapter, the International SAE Fraternity, and a number of its local officers and members only adds gravity and urgency to our need to cooperate together in implementing the changes summarized below.\n",

They will continue to work with alumni and undergraduates, the Fraternity and Sorority Advisory Council, and the Office of Fraternity and Sorority Affairs to support a strong Cornell Greek System.\n",

      "       **Moratorium is defined as the period when there will be no formal or informal recruitment activities initiated or organized by fraternity and sorority members.  Contact with freshmen will be limited to those interactions that occur in the normal day-to-day conduct on campus and in the classroom and through campus related organizations and activities.**\n",
      "       Moratorium commences with the arrival of the freshman class on campus and concludes at the end of fall semester break.  For academic year 2011-2012, this time period will last from **August 19th to October 11th**.\n",
      "       **For freshmen, this period of time should be devoted to academic and residential transition to the new University environment.\n",
      "       Chapter members will not engage with freshmen in chapter organized events or activities during this time period.  This restriction applies to all events and activities including, but not limited to; chapter houses, chapter annexes, residences in Collegetown, or other off-campus locations.**\n",
      "       Chapters may choose to focus on recruiting transfer students and upperclassmen during this time.\n",
      "       The fraternity and sorority system will be presented to freshmen as an option through general informational opportunities planned and guided by the Tri-Council and the Office of Fraternity and Sorority Affairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "o       2nd Quarter – Informal Recruitment\n",
      "       Informal Recruitment is defined as the period when **freshmen are permitted to engage with chapter members in activities that do not involve alcohol or other drugs to learn about individual fraternity and sorority chapters and their members**.\n",

      "       For freshmen, this period of time will be their introduction to the organizations, the facilities if applicable, and chapter members.  The councils may choose to develop and provide a schedule of organized activities during this time period.  For example, the Interfraternity Council (IFC) may create a schedule of supplemental smokers and dinners to allow organized opportunities for freshmen to meet and interact with members to gain an informed orientation to the IFC and individual chapters.\n",
      "       Chapters may host an array of informal recruitment activities to introduce potential members to the chapter’s members, programs, and the values of the organization as well as the physical house itself where applicable.  These events will be free of alcohol, illegal substances, and any form of activities that could be construed as hazing as defined by the Campus Code of Conduct.\n",

Formal Requirement for Asian-Interest organizations commences on January 23rd and concludes on February 3rd, 2011.\n",
      "       **There will be no alcohol or drugs used, furnished, or present during any period of contact with the freshmen.  This includes, but is not limited to; informational sessions, dinners, smokers, day activities, contacts, and night events.  Even if the location of the event or activity is located outside of the chapter house or outside of Ithaca, alcohol and any other drugs are prohibited**.\n",
      "       If they so choose, chapters will extend bids at the conclusion of Formal Recruitment.\n",
      "       Chapters that choose to participate in Continuous Open Bidding will abide by the rules herein stated for the 3rd Quarter.  Continuous Open Bidding must be complete by the initiation deadline, which is April 1st for the spring 2012 semester.\n",
      "       New Member Education is defined as the period when new members/associate members learn the history, values, and responsibilities of membership for their individual chapters.\n",
      "\n",
      "       New Member Education commences with the first day following Bid Day and concludes approximately eight weeks from the beginning of the academic semester as determined by the University.  For academic year 2011-2012, this time period may last from **January 23rd to April 1st.\n",
      "       Chapters will not conduct any social activities or events with alcohol or other drugs if new members are present.  This includes, but is not limited to; activities and events such as “pledge parties” and “mixers” regardless of location.**\n",

      "The shortest version of the tale is that I took a class in combinatorics in my second semester of college as a physics major, ostensibly to try to get into summer research program, but also to serve as a natural continuation for the extreme passion for mathematics that my first semester had cultivated. While my initial days in the class were marked by ebullience and enthusiasm, the weekly homework sets began to prove harder and harder for me. Despite the effort I was putting into the class, I could not see solutions to exercises that others could see in an instant. This is the force behind the angst that my critics would say produced this paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "The natural question to ask is \"what went wrong?\" I place the blame partially on myself for my incompetence, but also on the way combinatorics is taught. My claim is that the culture cultivated in undergraduate combinatorics promotes a very steep learning curve for the subject, and then proceeds to punish those on the wrong side of the curve instead of uplifting them. Whether or not such a culture is a fundamental property of combinatorics itself is a matter of further investigation. The first thing I noticed in the class was a distinct lack of an overarching theme besides \"counting things\" and perhaps \"graphs\". The class was almost taught like a dry analysis textbook, where theorems were stated, examples were exhibited, and proofs were demonstrated. Often times, there was little motivation for the next step in the class. Perhaps this characteristic of the course was partially what made it difficult for me to catch on, but my main problem lies in the culture of the combinatorial community.  \n",

      "There is a jocular saying in mathematics, that all solved problems are \"trivial\". Often times this is true: It is absolutely not clear at first how to solve the differential equation \n",

      "\n",
      "but once a general method for solving these types of equations is understood, a good student (or even a poor one like me) will understand exactly where it comes from and consider the result \"easy\" and \"expected\". I am afraid that in the culture of combinatorics, the above saying is taken all too seriously. When a group of students work together on combinatorial problems, often times one group of students describes the problem as trivial and sees exactly how to solve it, while the other group of students fails to see the solution, so the problem is nontrivial. At the very least, the way combinatorial problems are viewed at the undergraduate level differs from person to person in an extremely severe way, often creating a disconnect between those who see problems as trivial and those who do not. \n",
      "\n",
      "Such a view even extends to the professor. When I went to office hours after a particularly poor homework score, I asked the professor for help on how to think about problems. I got (admittedly clear) solutions to the problems, but not much more other than the assertion that such problems are straightforward. I do not see an issue like this in any other fields besides combinatorics. In the field of analysis, for instance, the culture is to treat problems with the respect they deserve after requiring effort and work to solve. Indeed, I have not heard anyone in my partial differential equations class—much less my professor—describe a problem as \"easy\" or \"trivial\". (My professor likes using the word \"hard\" to describe problems, but I view this as a good thing. In describing one of the problem sets as the \"hardest homework of the course\", it was not to discourage students from solving all the exercises, but it was an expression of respect to the necessary work and thought needed to solve such problems and a categorical denouncing of this so called \"attitude of triviality\". In essence, it was an invitation for all of us to join him on his side of the \"learning curve\", as opposed to derision towards those of us still on the \"low side\" of the learning curve.)\n",
      "\n",
      "I suppose it is now a good time to compare my partial differential equations class to my combinatorics class in the context of mathematical education. While I do not profess to be an expert in this topic, I believe I can say something about it because I have benefited in different capacities from different styles of education. I have nothing but the utmost praise for my PDE professor's educational style, as it is what helped me grow as a student of PDE. A clear example of the superiority of his teaching is when I came to see him at his office hours to ask for a proof of the Arzelà-Ascoli theorem (we had used it in a proof of existence for the IVP for first order ODE, and I wanted to know how to prove it to satisfy my completionist urges). Rather than going through the motions of the proof (which alone would have satisfied me as an auditory learner), he started to build me up on the theory of why we would want such a theorem in the first place. To that extent, he demanded participation from me as well; he had me generate an example of continuous functions that fail to converge pointwise to a continuous function (motivating the idea of \"uniform convergence\"), having me not only show that uniformly convergent continuous functions converge to a continuous function but also explain the conceptual significance of the proof and why exactly we need uniform convergence. (This is to say that he was not satisfied by the correct answer I originally gave where I just cited the earlier counterexample, but made sure I actually understood the reason why uniform convergence somehow worked). \n",
      "\n",
      "The benefits of this form of teaching are clear—the student not only gains the proof of the theorem but also a broader understanding of the (often historical) context of the proof and where the proof \"comes from\". This is perhaps the best way that an educator can not only encourage a student to go beyond what is taught in class, but equip them with the mindset to do so. This stands in stark contrast to the \"definition-theorem-proof\" style of the combinatorics class, where the focus is just on understanding proofs and tricks as opposed to building a general, overarching theory and mindset to progressing further in the field. \n",

      "So I had some extra time because July 4 and all, and I thought I’d do something personally interesting. I’m not that open for being identified, but I’m a recent engineering grad (past 5 years). I know freshmen (incoming and first/second semester students) tend to worry a lot about grades. I saw the median grade spreadsheet that includes data from different classes, and thought it would be interesting to see what my own experience summarized would look like \\[[imgur album](https://imgur.com/a/Tgk4mkN), individual pics linked below too\\].\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I made a [distribution of median grades of classes I took by semester](https://i.imgur.com/svQ3yzb.png). These aren’t weighted by number of credits, just number of classes. The numbers in the boxes correspond to the level of the course. This isn’t all inclusive because 5000 and 6000 level courses don’t post median grades. This also doesn’t include classes taken S/U. The major category includes classes required specifically for the major (affiliation requirements and any class under the department). The non-major STEM category includes the engineering core curriculum (math, chem, physics, etc.) and other classes taken in a science or engineering department that weren’t my major. Non-STEM is everything not included in the previous categories (FWS’s, liberal studies, etc.). I came in with some AP/IB credit, so I placed out of a couple engineering core classes, otherwise there might have been a B- or C+ median, but I don’t think that’s too significant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Observations about this first chart include a few main ones. All of the non-STEM classes I took had a median grade of at least an A-. This is likely heavily skewed by electing to take easier liberal studies classes, but not all of them are necessarily known as easy A’s. In contrast, none of the classes in my major (that I took) have a median grade of A. The only ones with a median of A- were taken during my senior year. 3000 level classes also don’t mean higher median grades. Most of the 3000 level classes I took were within my major and none were liberal studies, so that could also explain it, but only one 3000 level class I took (which had a reputation of being an easy A) had a median above a B+.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next thing I looked at was inspired by the [median grade spreadsheet](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/8o539b/median_grade_spreadsheet/). I looked at the some [statistics of the median grades](https://i.imgur.com/z7Kl7Vx.png), which isn’t great given the limited sample size, but that’s all I have at my disposal. I looked at the average median grade point, the weighted average (by credit) median grade point, and the median median grade point (didn’t do a weighted by credit). The results were unsurprising (at least to me). Classes taken for my major had the lowest average and weight average median grade points. Non-STEM classes had a significantly higher median grade point, but again, these are highly elective classes. The STEM classes outside my major were higher than inside my major, but that could be skewed by that one easy A course. The median for both major and non-major STEM courses was a B+, as was the overall median median grade point for all of the classes I took.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I looked at these [statistics by semester](https://i.imgur.com/T7GxEOp.png), which is even more flawed due to the even smaller sample size of each group, but oh well, I thought it would be interesting. This time, there is no differentiation between class type, only by semester. I don’t think you could say there is a significant increase in median grades in my case until senior year. The red sparkline is a general trend (not actual values) in my overall GPA.  Interestingly enough, it does follow the general increase and decrease with median grades, but to a smaller extent in later semesters, suggesting your GPA can’t change too much in your senior year due to the large number of existing credits, despite higher median grades. This observation is also not great, because it doesn’t account for the 5000 and 6000 level classes that I took in my junior and senior years, as they don’t have published median grades.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, I’m not sure what real conclusions you can get from this post, but it’s something concrete to look at for those curious. I don’t really know if there are good takeaways from this either. I guess liberal studies do tend to increase your GPA. Don’t be too worried if your GPA is lower than what you had in high school. Don’t be worried too much about grade deflation (because honestly, a B median isn’t grade deflation. It’s just not grade inflation. But also, with the number of classes with an A- and A median at Cornell, it could also be argued that there is a decent amount of inflation). There’s only so much you can do about your grades. Try your best, but also keep up your mental and physical health. Everything will be all right in the end. I’ll answer general questions, but nothing too identifying. I hope someone else other than me found this interesting. Enjoy your Independence Day, Cornellians.\n",

      "\n",
      "Other than that, a few comments (not an authoritative source):\n",
      "\n",
      " * Take at least one class every semester just for fun. It will remind you that learning used to be fun.\n",
      "\n",
      " * Never take an easier equivalent of a class (ie, econometrics for business majors vs. econometrics for econ majors).\n",
      "\n",
      " * Schedule light semesters around the weeder classes (you'll hear what they are. Usually CS211 or Org Chem).\n",
      "\n",
      " * Learn in class. Really pay attention, ask questions, take active notes (not just copying, but summarizing). Learn the Cornell Note Taking Method. Try to never have to study. Really.\n",
      "\n",
      " * Go to every class. You pay $100 an hour for instruction; don't waste it. You'll never catch up otherwise.\n",
      "\n",
      " * Get to know your professors outside of class. Office hours or department meetings or seminars are fantastic. Some of the best friendships you'll make in college will be with professors - and they'll serve you earliest as you look for jobs and opportunities. Being on good terms with the professor also makes it a lot easier to learn from them - a very strange but obvious mental shortcut.\n",
      "\n",
      " * Join a mastermind group or set one up. Keep each other accountable for each others goals. Assign each other deadlines for long-term projects so you don't cram at the end. Include personal goals too.\n",
      "\n",
      " * Try to join the Telluride Association. It's not a frat.\n",
      "\n",
      " * Learn how to get laid often (or, if a woman, learn how to get a guy to commit). Beyond the immediate benefit, it instills a confidence and charisma that will serve you as well as your education. Particularly if you're an engineer.\n",
      "\n",
      " * Learn a great theoretical foundation. Also learn at least two directly applicable trade skills that relies on that theory. Examples: Set Theory: SQL and Combinatorics. Do this for as many theoretical frameworks as you can. Applications pay off even in academia; very few get away with only knowing theory.\n",
      "\n",
      " * Focus on learning and education beyond grades. It's okay to get a bad grade if you're positive you got the lesson; horrible (though incredibly tempting) to get an easy A. This is not high school; grades here don't matter. Anything above failing is acceptable. Education does matter. Hell, find time to read books on subjects outside your major.\n",
      "\n",
      " * Make really good friends with people who seem respectable, admirable or successful to you. They'll last the rest of your life. The rest of your life is a really, really, REALLY long time. Choose wisely.\n",
      "\n",
      " * Learn enough about yourself that you can avoid the stress of evaluation, your limits, your fears. Learn to relax and things will come a lot easier. People will envy your ability to calmly walk in, take a test, and smile on the way out. They'll think you're a genius instead of someone who learns in class, gets enough sleep, and completes projects ahead of schedule. Learn that no amount of self-discipline, innate talent, inherent intelligence, or willpower is enough for this task. Learn to structure your life to support your work, or else it will overwhelm you.\n",
      "\n",
      " * Dance or sing or paint or do something creative so the right hemisphere of your brain doesn't completely collapse during engineering classes.\n",
      "\n",
      " * If you ever, ever start thinking about suicide, get help right away. It's super easy at Cornell, and even if for some reason it's not, it's the one thing that's worth fighting for. You're allowed to fail all your classes and get kicked out of school and have your parents disown you (hell, my friends who dropped out are doing better than many of my friends who went to graduate school), but you are not allowed to kill yourself. Ever. As one of my best friends said, \"If you kill yourself, I will so kick your ass.\"\n",

This isn't weird, it's actually kind of cool, and it makes for a smaller, tight-knit community instead of a big dorm experience. However, if you're not in one of the program houses (JAM for musicians, Ujamaa for african-american cultural living, HILC for international students) it can be sort of isolating. I personally lived in JAM my first year, and it was a blast, but it's very hit or miss - it really depends on how social the average JAMmie is that year.

You still have to enroll through your jtf.cornell.edu account, but Chequerd will help you visualize it and figure out what you WANT before it's time to enroll. Some people will tell you about a site called Schedulizer that does roughly the same thing, but Chequerd works way better. It's just not as well known. \n",

It's easy - your grade is based on 4 papers and participation, just make sure those are good and then you're all set - and the material is interesting and fun.

      "But really, congratulations.  I'd advise spending some time researching the campus, the town, and the school itself, but to save you some time, here's 10 things I wish I had known before I went to Cornell:\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorms.  You'll receive papers soon that allow you to specify roommate and dorm preferences.  According to your personality, you'll want to find a good fit.  Here's how they go:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Mews, Court/Kay/Bauer - the newest and nicest dorms.  Not very social, but beautiful rooms.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Donlon - by far the most social, but an older building.  Rooms are still acceptable.  Design funnels everyone into a central lounge, and there's 90 people per floor.  There's floor v. floor athletic tournaments throughout the year, plus it has the best quiet study space in any dorm.  Always a good time, plus right next to Bear Necessities (Nasty's) and RPU dining hall. (If you can't tell, I lived in Donlon and fucking loved it.)\n",
      "\n",
      "* Highrises - still social, but smaller floors.  Relatively crappy rooms.  Advantage, also close to RPU/Nasty's.\n",
      "\n",
      "* JAM (Low-rise 9) - the music house.  Only live here if you're a band geek.  If you are, it's paradise, if not, you probably won't like it.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Risley - A.K.A. the Freak Show.  Home of the art/theater majors.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Eco-house - Much as it's name suggests, it houses a lot of the more environmentally-inclined students.  Also, it's an overflow dorm, so it can end up with a very weird, not-so-cohesive mix.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Akwekon, Ujamaa, Latino Living Center - Cornell's wonderful racially segregated houses.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Balch - I'm assuming you're a guy.  In that case, you can't live in Balch, but if you want a full Cornell experience, you haven't lived unless you've snuck out of a girl's room in Balch trying to be all ninja-ish to avoid RA's and staff (it's an all-girls dorm, men need escorts to walk around.)\n",
      "\n",
      "* Clara Dickson - Also pretty social, but not really designed well.  Doesn't have good central meeting places.  Does have a beach volleyball court.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Townhouses - If you're prepared to essentially live in an apartment, do this.  They have kitchens, and decent common areas.  You generally won't need to hit up the dining halls if you live here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Food.  RPU will be your best friend.  Appel is also good, but not as good.  Bear Nasty's is your best source of late-night food.  On central campus, Okenshield's has the nickname Oken-shits, but it's not that bad, and they accept meal plans.  The Ivy Room in Willard Straight is cash/Big Red Bucks, but it's by far the best food on central campus.  There's also Trillium, if you're an engineer, and Mac's, under the Statler, if you're a hotelie.\n",
      "\n",
      "Parties.  You'll be fratting your freshman year.  It's the best way to meet people, to decide if you want to rush, and frankly, the best way to get fucked up.  Cornell is a dry campus, so you're not allowed to have any alcohol in the dorms.  Considering that any semblance of a dorm party will get shut down immediately, it's just not worth the hassle of getting in trouble.  Just walk down to University Ave (AKA frat row) and do your drinking there.  Also, The Hot Truck on west Campus and Louie's Lunch on North are the two greatest food trucks you will ever experience.  Take advantage of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Girls.  I may be a bit biased given that my current girlfriend went there, but gentlemen, Ithaca College is the place to be.  The girls are simply more attractive, bigger partiers, and way less concerned about making it to class the next day.  If you can trek over to the other hill, go have fun.  In addition, half the girls at any frat party are probably IC girls.\n",
      "\n",
      "Academics - fuck this.  I'll tell you the only thing, as an Arts student, that you need to know.  You can take one class per semester pass/fail.  Use this to get rid of every stupid breadth requirement you don't want to take.  In A&amp;S, you have to take a foreign language, a science, a math, etc.  Take them pass/fail so you can devote more time to your major GPA.\n",
      "\n",
      "The town.  Explore Ithaca.  A lot.  It's a great city, and there are lots of fun people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Weed.  Approximately 50% of the people in Ithaca smoke weed, no joke.  If you're an ent, this'll be paradise.  If not, you've gotta at least try it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your Advisor.  Cornell will assign you an advisor when you get there.  As soon as possible, I would advise finding a professor you like in your interested field of study, and asking them to be your advisor.  They'll be infinitely more helpful than your randomly-assigned advisor, and will most likely develop into a solid recommendation letter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Libraries - You'll discover different nooks and crannies depending on your study style, but there are a couple places you have to check out:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Olin - The carrels.  Each floor has carrels lining the entire outside walls of the building.  They're all technically reserved for grad students, but you can always find a free one.  The basement - best place in the summer, it's cool and has outlets everywhere.  You'll find that you want your computer charged at all times before going to the libraries, as outlets are not exactly a priority in a lot of the old buildings.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Uris - The fishbowl (a.k.a. the Cocktail Lounge.)  Built into the Slope, this huge study room was my personal favorite.  Comfy chairs, quiet, cool, and lots of outlets.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Mann/Johnson/whatever - The other libraries outside of the main quads and Ho Plaza are usually less populated.  If that's more your style, you can find some good places.\n",
      "\n",
      "Athletics - Cornell hockey is amazing.  Basketball was great while I was there, not so much anymore.  However, no matter what, at least once, you have to go to a Cornell-Harvard hockey game.  Best sports environment in the Ivy League.  Also, I'm not sure if you can still do this, but you used to be able to get a big red sports pass for free that either let you into damn near every athletic event for free, or at least massively reduced ticket prices.  I think I only ever paid a couple bucks a game for basketball, maybe a couple for football, and then hockey was the biggie.\n",

At this point, I'm willing to throw my advanced standing away and switch majors. I am considering switching into Applied Economics and Management, the business school here at Cornell, while pursuing a minor in Operations Research and Management Science (the only part of engineering that I'm actually interested in). I would never, however, consider switching universities, nor have I actually chosen to depart from engineering quite yet.\n",

Having been through 1920 in my first semester, I can say that I definitely was not prepared for the rigor that Cornell expects of their engineers; not just with BC. 1910 and 1920 have lousier curves, but most courses (if my research serves me correctly) curve in the B range, depending on the class. Others that lack curves may have substantial opportunities for you to succeed (for example, this semester of 1920 allegedly has no curve, but you are allowed to correct your tests for 1/2 credit back).\n",

Here, I'm good enough to be Dean's List-ed in Engineering. You've got to get used to getting a paper back that has a grade in the 60s or 70s, even if you worked and studied like crazy. It's depressing, but you've just got to keep a sense of self-confidence. Often times, you'll get your exam back, and with such a grade, still be on or near the mean. As long as you do your work and attend lectures, you'll be ahead of a lot of people. Remember, everyone else is in the same boat, and many can't be bothered to actually try.\n",

Your advisors don't really know much about the first two years: They will be able to help you if you choose to enter their department, and try to sell you their major otherwise. Engineering advising is horrifically bad and have given me poor advice on several occasions. You'll learn more about yourself, by yourself, than you could ever imagine. You'll learn how you work, how you socialize, how you manage time, how you can live, how you best succeed, and what you can and can't do for a living. I can easily say that I've learned more about myself in the past year than I had all throughout HS. As for class issues, you'll learn the workings of the engineering program through your upperclassman peers (hint: join clubs!), what courses to take, and how best to take them. \n",

I am heavily involved in a couple of organizations on campus, and definitely have time left in my day. The severity of the workload isn't bad at all, provided that you stick to somewhere between 15 and 18 credits.

The program is designed to naturally push you to a field of study that you're a good fit for. If you know you're not liking something, reassess yourself. I personally don't like the engineering prerequisites and distribution requirements that are required; I have a legitimate interest in ORIE, but it is very difficult to find application to my intended field of financial analysis and management in most parts of the engineering distribution.\n",

What's more key (as far as I've gathered from career fairs) is that you know how to program; I'd suggest that you don't dedicate all your study to the art of programming.

      "Ah. I've really only ever found one useful study method but it has two implementations: (1) \"explain\" the class to \"someone\" (which may simply be writing an unsent email to a friend) or (2) tell the story of the class. Cal Newport has relatively recently started writing about this, calling it \"the textbook method\". \"The class\" here can be resized to various things: the entire class (very useful for figuring out what you don't know), the homeworks as a whole, each individual homework, the exams.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first case the act of attempting to teach something very effectively clarifies what you don't actually know (and forces you to learn it to actually teach it) and reinforces that which you do know (in a way that \"reading over the material\" does not); it's part of the reason I'm such a fan of helping others with their homework even if the class is curved and even if I were purely self-interested: sure they benefit and raise the curve, but in helping them I learn the material so well that it doesn't matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "To try to explain \"the story of the class\" idea, I'll have to start somewhere else. When I read a (long) work of fiction the first thing I do when I've finished it is tell myself a summary of the story (the major events that happened and *why* they happened). Start with where we started at and the journey we took to get to the place we ended at. I do this to help digest what I've read, but mostly because I'm always really sad when I finish it and this is sort of a coping mechanism. As a side effect, I find I retain the story for longer.\n",

We started the class learning about how to build AND and OR and NOT gates, and we ended the class building program as a DMA network card driver. But it was really hard to learn about AND and OR and NOT gates when you didn't know why (they're boring). I, however, knew why: you need to know how to build those gates to build transistors, and you need to know how to build transistors to build APUs and memory, and you need to know how to build those things to build CPUs and a system capable of general purpose computing, and you need to know that to understand assembly as a set of bits, which you need to understand assembly (and why it's so rudimentary and simple), which you need to understand C, which you need to understand operating systems, which you need to understand C and other languages, etc... (for more, read \"Joel on Software\"'s blog post on the law of leaky abstractions).\n",
      "\n",

      "Also, personally, I don't take notes. I do better in classes when I don't. This works because of resources like online lecture notes, course books (available at library), the internet, office hours, and friends. The point is, there's a lot of resources outside of class which makes it so that you don't need detailed notes of what happened in lecture (if there's something you don't know a month later, you don't need notes to learn it, there are other (better) resources). For some people the act of taking notes in lecture helps them internalize it. For me, it prevents me from paying attention and internalizing things, instead making me a machine that takes audio input and transcribes it onto paper (without any detours into the understanding or memory parts of my mind). If you're a good student (by which I mean organized and start things ahead of time) (I am not), you can spend 10 to 25 minutes a class reviewing what you learned (e.g., while walking to another class) (e.g., by telling yourself the story of what you were taught in class, like the above study method). Cal Newport wrote about this a while ago, something to the effect of \"the no note method of acing a class\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Cal Newport has extensive posts on varieties of note taking (e.g., \"The Cornell Method\") and studying; he's even written a couple (a few?) books on the subjects, though I have not read any of them. I started reading him to learn time management. I personally mostly value him because of his articles on deep procrastination (absolutely nailed why I almost failed out) and what he tends to deem \"the failure of the passion hypothesis\" (the idea that you have to \"find your passion\" and then make that your life's work to be happy, as opposed to the idea that passion is something you build with dedication and effort and deliberate practice), but his articles on time management did help me (probably the most of any articles on time management). The point is that I've pretty much said all that I know on note taking and studying, as a counterbalance you might want to read about other methods and I've found study hacks to be a good resource for that.\n",

      "When I was a MechE, average GPA was a 2.9-3.0, and an honors required a 3.2.  Usually you graduate with a major GPA in that range, then your liberal arts classes bring your GPA up into the low 3s, and that's what you put on your resume when you graduate.  Its different by major though.\n",

Take notes during the class, but since you've already paid attention to the material, try and understand it.  Use the homework to make sure you understand it.  That will help when studying for the exams, which you should probably leave a ~week for, and study a bit each day.  Buy a calendar at some point early in the semester, and mark down when all your exams / homework / projects are due, this can help you figure out when you need to start studying/reviewing for each class.  But honestly, I wouldn't worry about this.  You'll start figuring it out your first semester.  Everyone's in the same boat together, and you'll know a bunch of people in your classes, by virtue of being a freshman.  You all will figure it out together, and your first few tests will calibrate it for you.  *shrug.\n",

      "&gt; How difficult is the engineering workload? \n",
      "\n",
      "The hardest part of the engineering workload is the engineering workload culture.  If I could give only one piece of advice to every new freshman, this would be it.  You're entering a world class university.  When you graduate, you will literally be able to fly to most countries around the world and land a job based on the name of the university alone.  That means you're probably a pretty high caliber person (whether you know it or not), and you're entering a school with a lot of such people.  There's a real culture in the engineering school to push people to work really, really hard.  Part of it is people want to say \"engineering is so hard, blah blah blah\".  Part of it is professors who try to look tough (there are some in every university, and some on this forum).  Some of it is there are just a lot of students that have never been intellectually challenged before, and are excited by the prospect, or are trying to get through in less time.  Regardless, it breeds a little bit of a culture where people will brag about how many credits they're taking each semester.  IGNORE IT.  Take your standard 4 classes (16 credits) each semester, and no more.  If you want to throw on a writing seminar, or gym class, or project team, go for it, those things are fun, and some of the project teams are real resume builders.  But that's it.  Don't take 5 real classes.  If you take 20+ credits a semester, you're going to spend all your time studying, and your life is going to suck.  A large part of the point of college is the people you meet and become life long friends with.  If you take the normal 4, you'll spend time learning, but you'll have free time to hang out with people, play games, go to parties, play a sport, whatever you want to do that makes things fun for you, and if you need to spend extra time bringing your grades up in a class that seemed more difficult than you thought, you'll have the free time to dedicate.  Life is all about balance, its easier to learn this the easy way.  Not to mention you should always leave yourself some free time just in case life throws you a curveball anyway, because if there's one thing life likes to do, its to throw things at you that you weren't expecting.  And remember, you don't have to prove anything to anybody; you're there to learn and have fun.\n",

First snow is usually over thanksgiving break, the next snow in December.  So if you're (un)lucky, you might not get any fall semester.  Spring semester there'll be snow for the majority of it, but you learn how to dress warm.  Occasionally the wind will bite your face a little bit, but that's about the worst of it.\n",

The hard part, honestly, can be finding it.  Unlike many other universities, Cornell is _not_ centralized.  If you don't explicitly look for what you're interested in, and put real effort into finding people / clubs / classes / places that do that activity, you won't find it.  Its just the nature of a large spread out university.  But it is there, and its important that you find such cliques to have a good college experience.  But this is more advice for your sophmore year and later, your freshman year you're going to be meeting so many new people running around in such large groups of people I wouldn't worry about this at all.\n",

And if it isn't fun, go choose something else that you find to be fun.  Learning should come with passion, and you're entering one of the few places in the country where literally any effort you put into any aspect of your life will yield huge dividends beyond what you can image.

      "**Ok, here's the answer you're looking for:**\n",
      "\n",
      "(I'm actually just going to post this directly to /r/Cornell now that I see how big it has become)\n",
      "\n",
      "**1) [Click Here For the Data](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=weather+in+14850+in+2014)** (you can change the 14850 to your zip code to compare.)\n",
      "\n",
      "**2) Here is my commentary on the data:** Cornell weather is not that bad for most people along the northern border of the U.S. It can get down to -10 F (last year it hit -17) but there are only a few weeks when you're below 10 degrees F. Windchill a little worse. Cornell is in a flat section of the state and that means lots of wind, but not as much as any costal town or city. This means windchill can be a factor. At the end of the day, anyone from NYC or Chicago would be fine at Cornell. Cornell only gets such a bad name because it has a big campus and attracts many students from far away who are woefully unprepared.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3) Here is my description of how cold weather works:** I think this is important. Numbers are meaningless without the ability to interpret them. You are from Texas, I see. I know the idea of sub-zero is foreign, but truthfully, it just means more layers. I'm not going to go off on talk about air pockets. Instead let me talk about what it takes to feel comfortable, to feel warm. First, no individual body part can be cold. Second, the body cannot feel its core temperature dropping.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ok, what this means is if any part of your body is exposed to cold objects that *conduct heat* away from you body quickly then that body part is going to feel cold. Things such as carrying books without gloves, walking in thin shoes (*especially* if they're wet, oh god water is a good conductor of heat), or wind on exposed skin will suck the heat from those parts of the body. This makes them feel cold. What that means for you is three things: boots, gloves, hat.\n",
      "\n",
      "But here's the truth about all of this: you are a big bag of circulating water. Your body is more than happy to just throw heat at your hands to keep the tissue at normal temperature. It's more than capable of it as well. The problem is that when your body feels its core temperature dropping it panics and constricts blood flow to your extremities. It is willing to sacrifice some heat in the hands (or feet, or nose) to try to conserve as much heat in the torso as possible. This means the hands get cold and causes pain. A lot of times you'll see someone with gloves on talking about how cold their hands are, cursing the gloves, while someone right next to them isn't wearing gloves and feels fine. The difference is that person has warmer clothes around their legs and torso, and that means the body has excess heat to throw at the hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Try this experiment sometime. Pick up an ice cube. That is literally all you have to do. Roll it around in your hand and feel how it doesn't make your hands hurt. That is because—and I'm going to get kinda patriotic in a \"the human body is awesome\" kind of way—that little piece of crystalized H20 does't have *crap* on the thousands of miles of intricate water circulation system dedicated to keeping that patch of tissue exactly the temperature it should be at. If you can make your torso *hot*, then only 10 degrees or below weather *with* a windchill will be strong enough cause real discomfort to exposed skin.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4) Here is a discussion on clothes:** Truth be told, this question is better answered in terms of what you need to wear. You feel the same in the dead of winter at Cornell as you do in fall at Texas. As the Swedes say: \"there is no such thing as bad weather, just bad clothing.\" This does not mean you need to spend a lot on clothes. There are a lot of ways to design a warm winter wardrobe, but here are some of the basics.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, there are three different kinds of layers: the wicking layer, the warmth layer, and the weather layer. Wicking is just what goes on your skin or near it. It should be breathable and *wick* (pull) moisture (such as sweat) away from your skin. I really don't pay attention to this. I'm a Boy Scout so on weekend long campouts it's important, otherwise t-shirt and underwear is fine. Second is warmth. This can be a fancy parka or jacket, or just sweater. Third is weather, and this means wind and water protection. You do not want water or wind pulling heat directly from your torso! When implemented it looks like this: underwear, t-shirt, winter jacket. The winter jacket has both warm and weather built into one. If you need more warmth, add a sweater, then long underwear, then another sweater.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other things to think about:\n",
      "\n",
      "* You have to be careful about being able to take off layers. Too much and you'll be too warm inside. That's why I have a few different jackets depending on the weather, because ideally you want to be able to take off only your outside layer and be cool enough indoors. I avoid long underwear because of this (if I can). I have a light jacket for fall and a heavy parka for winter, that I can unzip if I'm too hot and take off once inside.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Boots are a big one when snow hits. They prevent wet (and thus, cold) feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Face masks are great for the worst months. I really recommend a balaclava hood. It is a scarf and hat in one, with a face mask that can be pulled up to cover the nose and mouth. If you wear glasses make sure you get one that has holes/thin fabric in front of the mouth to prevent it from fogging up.\n",
      "\n",
      "* I highly recommend any gloves you get have a wind blocking layer. Otherwise they are basically just swiss cheese. Sure they're warm in still air, but add a breeze and they might as well be in your pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Cotton and wool are warmer than most synthetic material, so if you are looking for a hoodie or sweater as an intermediary pick those when in doubt. Note: they suck with wind resistance without other fibers mixed in or special treatments. Coats are often measured in a goose down number. I never understood the details, but basically it means the coat is as warm as a certain packing of goose feathers. You will see \"goose down 600\". The higher the number, the warmer, on a roughly linear scale.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5) Specific clothes to buy:** For the benefit of people who've never shopped cold weather gear before, I'll post some specific products and links. For the most part, I'm posting frugal buys that will get you through the rough of winter. Feel free to dismiss items that don't appeal to you, this is only a set of examples.\n",
      "\n",
      "* LLBean is a great company IMHO that has tremendous warranties, prices, and customer support. Click [here](http://www.llbean.com/llb/search/?freeText=winter+jacket&amp;init=1) for some of their jackets. I would recommend a Jacket that goes down to -25 degrees F from them (because you don't want to have to rely on wearing long underwear and a sweater, as they assume with those ratings). My fav is the [Weather Challenger 3-in-1 Jacket](http://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/83559?feat=3%20in%201-SR0&amp;page=weather-challenger-3-in-1-jacket).\n",
      "\n",
      "* Other options for coats on a budget are surplus military stock. They have no military markings, are made to be stylus in a plan way, durable, and very functional. Two example sites are [Army Surplus World](http://www.armysurplusworld.com/display.asp?subDepartmentID=276) and [Army Navy Outfitters](http://www.armynavydeals.com/asp/Default.asp?). Crappy websites but good products.\n",
      "\n",
      "* You want a good pair of warm walking boots. Mickey Mouse boots are a name given to a particular type of boots used by the U.S. military. They often have ugly yellow text on them, but that's only if you look at them up close and for as cheap as $20 from [here](http://stores.alleghenywholesale.com/usgi-military-bata-black-mickey-mouse-boots-w-valve-20f-brand-new/) they deserve a mention.\n",
      "\n",
      "* [These gloves](http://www.mechanix.com/cold-weather). They are a little annoying because of the logo, but Mechanix Wear makes the most functional gloves out there. Just the $10 [Thermal Knit](http://www.mechanix.com/cold-weather/thermal-knit) will do you well.\n",
      "\n",
      "* If you don't wear glasses, but [this](http://www.amazon.com/Chaos--CTR-Chinook-Balaclava-Windproof/dp/B002ZG7RFI/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1428097222&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=balaclava) baraclava for $20.

      "The Cornell experience has helped immensely in my career and sowed the seeds for the rest of my life.  However, it's not so much about magically having a piece of paper that says \"Cornell,\" but rather taking advantage of the resources, connections, and opportunities to meet people while there.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Just some background about myself:  I have a Psychology BA from Cornell, and during undergrad, my entire focus was about becoming a clinical psychologist.  After working full time in a neuroscience lab after Cornell, I realized I'd be better applied to neurology research than psychology.  Nowadays, I work regularly in two different neuro labs in the NYC area (flexible times, about $20/hr), while also working part-time on a pre-med post-bac at Rutgers University.  When not involving myself in science/medicine pursuits, my life is about jazz guitar.   \n",
      "\n",
      "Now to answer your questions:\n",
      "1)It's definitely alive there, although being that it's in the middle-of-nowhere, NY, you're going to be disconnected from places like NYC, where the real serious business happens.  Of course, if you're into things like environment, sustainable energy, agriculture, etc, you're in the right place.  I'm sure if you know what you are doing that you can find the right people to create tech startups, but something to keep in mind is that at Cornell, you will mostly just be surrounded by people from Cornell.  Going to NYC for example, you will have people from countless universities, and a gigantic startup community all over the region.  I've been involved with startups in Brooklyn, especially Bushwick, and just by virtue of there being sooo many people coming to this one centralized location, there's going to be a larger pool of people.  Then again, at a place like Cornell, you can probably throw a stone and hit a capable person you want on your team.  There's many people at Cornell, but there's no true slackers.  \n",
      "\n",
      "2)My Cornell connections have been so important to me, especially on a personal level.  You're going to find professors who just want to do research and couldn't care less about teaching your class, but you're also going to find some of the most amazing mentors you can ever imagine.  I got to know some of my professors at Cornell, both in music and psychology, and the personal and professional support has been something out of this world.  I came from a culture that told me that \"everyone hates their jobs, and I shouldn't hope for anything better\" and that my only purpose in life was to shut up, get a stable paycheck, and support a family.  My Cornell mentors helped me break out of that mediocre culture and learn to take my talents seriously and to apply myself fully to the world.  When I got my first research job full time out of Cornell, it was my mentor professors whose recommendations got me in the door.  Although I didn't have the explicit technical skills yet, they vouched for my ability to learn and that I'd pick it up.  I spent a lot of time and energy putting my all into my psychology studies at Cornell, and besides developing a very personal mentor relationship with my professors, I made it very clear that I was dead serious and was ready to live and breathe what I was embarking on.  Of course, when I say \"made it very clear,\" I mean that through actions and the best work you can possibly do.  When I got to that first job, just knowing that my professors had that much confidence in me was so inspiring to me that I ended up picking up the technical works, just as they thought I would.  Nowadays, a lot of the research work I'm involved in is based off of those skills.  \n",
      "\n",
      "If you know what you're doing at any state school, you can get a well paying corporate job.  However, a school like Cornell will bring you up to a higher socioeconomic level.  Coming from a culture that was centered around \"work is a 40/hr week miserable tax, everybody hates it, and there's nothing we can do about it, mope mope mope\" to a place where people were truly believed in me and invested in me becoming the most applied member of society I could be was something I never thought possible.  I don't know enough about Harvard or Yale to compare, but there was something about Cornell being up in the middle of nowhere that I think gave it this vibe.    \n",
      "\n",
      "3)When I mention that I did my undergrad at Cornell, there definitely is a \"wow\" factor.  Sometimes, people get defensive and try to one up you, but when I first got out of college, it definitely was sort of a validation with employers in the vein of \"oh, he went to Cornell, let's talk to him.\"  You still gotta have the goods to get hired and it's no magic card, but it doesn't hurt.  I'm currently studying at Rutgers, and it seems to me that if you know your specialized skills, make connections everywhere you go, and take advantage of all your resources, a Rutgers degree will be just as fine as anything else.  Then again, there certain connections and experiences available at Cornell that you'd never get at Rutgers.  Nowadays, the fact that I have a Cornell degree doesn't really matter much anymore.  The personal support from my mentors will always be so important to me, and I keep in touch with them regularly.  Also, the lessons I learned at Cornell, especially from my experiences in the jazz program, about hardwork, dedication, and fully applying yourself are integral to everything I am today.  \n",
      "However, at this point, it's really the work experience and the skillz that matter. For example, when it comes to programming and data analysis, there's a certain point where nobody cares where your degree is from...they want to know you can efficiently and effectively do your data analysis, or at least be ready to quickly pick up a new method of doing it.  The bottom line is that a lot of that is not stuff you learn from your degree, but you learn once you get the foot in the door at a job and are faced with the real world.  If you ask me, real world experience is both higher stakes and more rewarding than anything in the classroom....do an assignment the night before in a class, you might get a B on the project, and still get an A in the class.  Get an A on the project, and it's like whatever.  In the real world, if you half ass a project, you're toast and will torpedo your career because somebody will always be waiting in line.  You will also have wasted everybody's time and money, including your own.  If you ace a project, you will build your skills, build your reputation, build your career, and increase your personal value of what you can produce for society.  \n",
      "I've also noticed that when it comes to grad/med school, professors from college are definitely great for recommendations and referrals.  But once you get into the working world, referrals from places you've worked or supervisors become important.  At your first job out of college, they won't expect you to have a previous place to give a referral.  However when I started working at the second lab I'm at professionally, they wanted a referrence from the first lab I worked at professionally, not just a college professor.  Places that are interested in your work skillz will want to hear from places that are familiar with your work skillz.  Of course, at the beginning of all this was my experience at Cornell.  In a sense, college is like a launching pad to the rest of your life and career.  \n",

      "From what I gather in your post is that you're looking for specific instances in which students were physically attacked. Something tantamount to hate crime status right? You're looking to put some physical example to describe an overall climate. I recommend that you look the effects micro aggression to get a better understanding of not only why this is a form of the term \"violence\" and how it can have affects on people's lives. For example, there's a study where one group of students of color and women were reminded that historically they under perform in math and the other wasn't told anything. Once each group was given a math exam, the group that was reminded under performed. This is just one example of how different types of microagressions do matter. \n",

Right now you're calling your classmates \"cry babies\" and \"children.\" These young men and women are in the same place that you are - an elite institutions. I would hardly classify anyone like that a child. Further, because of what I think is your current mind set, then the examples won't mean anything to you and then everyone's back at square one.

      "I think it's also important to consider how you're defining \"truth.\" In a situation in which we're talking about racial bias, truth does depend on the person and the situation. How one person perceives the situation is different than how someone else does. That's why, for example, intent is often less important that how a message is received. And this reality is really frustrating and easy to blow off. How is it that something that's causing so much turmoil and causing a literal list of demands still be really difficult to put your finger on?\n",

Further, yea...sometimes people need to just suck it up. I did. I didn't complain about every single micro aggression or become offended when someone asked me when I learned english (I'm born and raised in NYC).

      "1. I constantly had to fight my advisor to let me take more than 15 credits a semester because she assumed that I was a HEOP student (which I wasn't). In fact, at one point she forcibly dropped a course and I had to talk to several people to let me back in. I was never below a 3.3 GPA and was trying to do two minors and a major - I need to make sure that I had all the courses I could - but because all she saw was a person of color she assumed I couldn't do it. This event took up time in my schedule and is just an example of how it was just assumed that I couldn't do something specifically because she thought I was a HEOP student.\n",

      "2. One of the clubs that I joined had an auction as a fundraiser where members auctioned off specific skills that they would teach the winning bidder. One black classmate was auctioning an item and another classmate made a really tasteless joke about slavery. The room got really quiet and the subject was quickly changed. This is an example of how this black student was called out as an other, and reminded of slavery - which obviously isn't what you expect when you're just trying to hang and be like everyone else. Another reminder that maybe you just don't belong.\n",

      "3. There wasn't a director for Haven (the LGBT center) for ages. It was entirely student run - despite there being a handful of clubs and a really legitimate need for a staff employee to provide a voice and credibility to the group. There were students who essentially were there to keep the doors open for anyone who needed a \"safe space\" (I know this isn't your favorite word, but it's the word that fits). After years of demanding, Cornell finally appointed someone part time. This allowed students to actually become not the directors, but the users of services, this allowed for incredible growth in the clubs and activities, and this allowed for a validation from the students that Cornell actually saw them as a legit organization.\n",

      "- a GPA of 2.5 or better in CS 2110/2112 and 2800\n",

      "\n",
      "Now let's talk about those classes. 2110 is Java. (I do not recommend 2112 unless you are for some reason dying to jump in the deep water for an honors class unrelated to the honors degree and that won't get you ahead in the subject.) You are only supposed to take this immediately if you have credit for AP CS, in which case you already know Java so this should only be as hard as following the minimal design ideas and data structure concepts they lecture on with object orientation. Otherwise, you take an intro to programming first, like Python, which should prepare you very well for the kind of assignments expected; you just need to learn the new language and paradigm. \n",

      "1920 is multivariable calculus, and is the course you will likely be taking as an engineer. As an engineering math course, it will probably assign problems sets in roughly the same manner as in highschool, and will be more calculation based than proof based. If you can remember formulas and manipulate ugly expressions well, it shouldn't be too painful. I got really bored with it (which might've hurt my grade a little due to lack of attention), but that is engineering math for you: tedious calculational techniques. Just keep doing calculus as you have been for the past two years in highschool. (I like the course the worst of the 3.)\n",
      "\n",
      "2800 is discrete math. For many CS majors, it is the first real, proof-based math course they will have ever taken. Many may even have had a misconception that CS was the same as software engineering, rather than a very distinct branch of mathematics. And many will never need to take another proof-based course again (besides algorithms), so they might not even be too wrong. If you have any mathematical intuition and reasoning skills, and can get used to writing clearly for that purpose, you will find that this course is not really too hard, though the material may seem very new compared to any other math you have taken before. That being said, mathematical competence varies wildly. For some, this will actually be a trivial class, and for others, this course will fail them miserably (though I feel more are in the first camp). If, however, you end up in the latter, CS is really probably not a good fit for you, because understanding a modicum of math like this is enormously important in pretty much all later CS courses. The material is piecemeal, but, once learned, is easy and is core to understanding in pretty much any later CS class. And, if you ever do start to struggle a little, there are tons of undergrad TAs who have taken this course and should be able to get you on the right track, so if you actually like CS and keep at it, failure should not happen. (I liked this course the best of the 3.)\n",

      "For perspective on the grading, averages in the ~75% range are common, and can even yield As when a few higher scores are mixed in. This is the grading trend you end up seeing: classes curve to somewhere in the B range (which is more than good enough to affiliate). Look at the average (statistics are always provided in CS courses) to estimate where you fall; getting above average consistently might as well be an A. Non-core courses may even curve higher than these, too. \n",

      "So, with all that aside, I have never heard of anyone being rejected who meets these requirements. (I imagine, even if you meet the requirements, they reserve the right to reject you for whatever reason and probably only use it for egregious academic integrity violations; I've just not seen this happen ever.) I *have* met people who did poorly in one class and could not affiliate with the major, but very few. And they can often successfully fall back on the similar, but less technical majors in the Engineering School, like operations research or info science. (Note: this is not to disparage those majors; there is simply a good transference of the process/design oriented ideas of CS, just without the stricture of perfectly specified and analyzed code that some people find doesn't fit their mindset.)\n",

      "In total, if CS is actually an interest that you have looked into, if you understand it takes a little more than just being a code-monkey, if you aren't in it just for the money or flashiness of the tech industry, then you really shouldn't expect the affiliation requirement to be a big or dangerous hurdle. It won't be free, but it should come. Yes, the average grade is lower here, but also don't forget that comes from a variety of factors besides sheer difficulty, and you can expect to do best in your core subjects, since they should interest you the most.\n",

      "\n",
      "When I was in the process of applying to college in high school, the first thing that I looked for in a university was a great undergraduate engineering program. As such, Cornell was on my list from the beginning. I was sure that I wanted to do engineering, but wasn't sure what exactly in engineering I was interested in (CS, materials science, biomedical engineering, and chemical engineering were my main interests at the time), so I wanted a university that had a lot of options for when I made up my mind. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, I chose Cornell less for its academic prowess and more for the feeling that I got on my first tour. My dad went to Cornell Engineering for his undergrad, so I had been on campus several times before, but Cornell was the first place where I stepped on campus and felt like I could actually live here for four years. I love the huge campus, and I love the fact that Cornell still feels like a small community in spite of its size. I met and had lunch with students in engineering, and they seemed like people I'd want to spend time with. They didn't fit into the \"engineer\" stereotype, and were able to balance their work with their extracurricular interests. They were also able to take liberal arts classes (I'm into languages and creative writing), which was something that seemed difficult to do at many of the other universities that I attended.\n",
      "\n",
      "So far, I have not been disappointed. I'm a sophomore now, and I've throughly enjoyed my experience at Cornell. I'm a member of four or five clubs, I participate in my residence hall community, I've made friends with some really cool and interesting people, and I work in a research lab doing work that could have significant positive impacts on the medical community.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of the student environment, engineering is extremely collaborative. I've made some of my closest friends through homework and group projects that I needed help on. The College of Engineering places a huge focus on collaboration and teamwork, so everyone is always happy to help if you're confused on something, or work on a problem set with you, or study for an exam. I've walked up to random people in Duffield Hall (the engineering social hub) who were working on homework for a class that I was taking, sat down, and asked them if they want to work on it together, and I've never been turned down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, I've never been bored. Given that we aren't in a city like NYC, most events/activities occur on campus and are run by student organizations/the university/greek life. At any point in time, there are festivals and athletic events (hockey games are super fun) going on that are open to the public. If you like to go out a lot and party, you can totally do that. Greek life tends to facilitate that, and most of the fraternities are situated very close to campus, so you can go out whenever you want. There are also a few clubs in Collegetown. If you're interested in social outings, there are an infinite number of options for that, especially given that freshmen get a free bus pass. There are fun formal events at the Johnson Museum where everyone gets to dress up, and there's a restaurant/bar near campus that does salsa nights on Wednesdays that I've heard are awesome. We also have things like Slope Day, a giant music festival in the spring.\n",
      "\n",
      "I like the blend of technical and non-technical courses that I get to take in engineering as well. We're required to take 18 credits of liberal studies courses to graduate, which amounts to about six classes over five years. Most freshmen don't take liberal studies courses, so you end up taking one every semester from your third semester on. I came in with a lot of AP credit in the humanities, so I don't have to take all 18 credits (I came in with 12 of the 18 credits), but I'm planning on doing a creative writing minor and taking several French courses. Obviously, our curriculum focuses on the engineering courses, but it is also flexible enough to allow you to take classes outside of engineering .\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking more generally, food was an important part of my college search, and Cornell has some of the best food I've had in general. I'd recommend the 14 meals/week plan to start, because you may eat breakfast and dinner on North campus as a freshman, and eat something smaller on central campus for lunch. There are a ton of options for food, so you'll never be bored with it (escpecially if you eat on west campus).  Statler has the best food on campus IMO, and they have a student run restaurant that does fun themed dinners every week. The food there is amazing, and pretty cheap ($15-20 for an entree and appetizer/dessert). \n",
      "\n",
      "The dorms are generally pretty nice. North campus has a lot more variance in quality, because the dorms have been build over the past few decades, but everyone I know was happy regardless of where they were. I lived in Dickson, the largest dorm on North, and I loved it. It is mostly singles, which was what I wanted, but it's really social. I made some of my closest friends through my hall. Court-Kay-Bauer and Mews are the nicest/newest, and have air conditioning. Donlon is the party dorm. \n",

      "Word of advice, a high overall GPA isn't the only number they look at. Med school admissions will take into account your BCPM (bio, chem, physics, math) GPA as well as your non-science GPA. On average, matriculates tend to have a higher non-science GPA because they know they can inflate their overall GPA, but also know that the difference between the average applicant and matriculant's BCPM GPA is much higher than the non-science GPA, indicating that med school admissions teams know that the inflated overall GPA isn't the best indicator of preparation, and really look out for those types of students. \n",

      "While you can definitely be in a frat and party while being premed, that's nowhere near a good excuse for trying to be in an easier major. It's not like you're the first one with this idea to try and win a numbers game. If it comes down to say an English major and a BioE major with the same, high overall GPA, the BioE major will probably have more related coursework, have shown a much deeper interest in biology/medicine, and have demonstrated that they can handle a science heavy courseload and will probably be a stronger candidate. Speaking of this, med schools also like to see that you're challenging yourself and like to see medically related courses outside of the typical premed requirements. It's helpful if you can bring more talking points to an interview and impress them if you know about things outside of simply orgo like how to actually apply fundamental knowledge to healthcare. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also take into consideration that easy majors are very subjective. Do you enjoy writing research papers? doing case competitions? memorizing hundreds of facts? working on problem sets? writing proofs? writing code? networking? being an a lab? I would say, go for a major that you are genuinely interested in. This will help loads when it comes down to prelims and finals when you start to lose motivation. If you are invested in the material because you like it, you will generally also do better in the classes. If you find the \"easiest\" major, you will be inclined to do the bare minimum for an A (if that) with little educational value (something your Cornell tuition is supposed to be getting you). \n",
      "\n",
      "One very annoying thing about premeds, is their attitude of complaining about their coursework in an excessive way. While there are definitely easier classes than say biochem, there is a reason med schools want you to learn about the fundamentals of math and physics. It's frustrating that people see these as hurdles preventing them from getting into med school, when it's to make sure that students have the right foundation. If you are really treating your undergrad experience as a way to get into med school, you'll find yourself very disappointed when you don't get into your top choice. If you treat it as a learning experience to help prepare you for a job in the medical field, be it as a doctor or not, you will find yourself in a much better headspace. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you really want to be a doctor, you'll put in the necessary work to be a doctor. Whether it be through an \"easy\" major or not, that's up to you. But also keep in mind, that assuming you're a freshman, prelim season has just started, and you're still not taking the most difficult courses, you have no idea how your grades will hold up over the next several semesters. A 3.85+ may look good, but it's likely you won't be able to keep it that high if you don't work your ass off when you need to. What people don't seem to understand is that there are \"easy A\" classes, but that's in comparison to a course with a median of a B. There's an not insignificant number of people who don't put in the work and don't get A's. Take ILRies for example. They often get the short end of the stick when it comes to easy majors, but the truth is, they just have different work. Sure they're not forced to spend hours stuck in a basement lab or do problem sets extend miles beyond lecture or even take a real science class despite ending in a BS, but they do a hell of a lot more reading and writing than I could mentally handle. And at the end of the day, a lot of them still won't end up with an A. Prelaw ILR students are definitely there, definitely need a very high GPA to get into law school, and definitely have to work their asses off to make sure they maintain a high GPA despite being in an \"easy\" major, but what helps is that the coursework they're doing is relevant to the end goal they want to achieve, and that's how you should approach being premed. If you want to be a doctor, take courses that will help you be a better doctor in the future, not what you think will necessarily get you into the best med school out there. You're in college to prepare you for your future. Cornell doesn't have a sticker price of $60K+ a year for its students to party whenever they want. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you want to be a doctor from a purely financial standpoint, you won't enjoy your undergrad, you med school, your residency, your job, your life as much as if you want to practice medicines for a better reason. Money and the name of a higher tier medical school aren't everything. Premed requirements are there partly to help weed out these people. Also, assuming you can get into one of the best medical schools with just a high overall GPA is super presumptuous to begin with and is not really the goal of those people who just really want to be doctors not for the money. While it's good to set goals for yourself, it's not great to make them expectations. \n",
      "\n",
      "All this being said, it's very possible to have a social life while being a premed in a STEM major at Cornell (there are always some Cornell engineers in some of the arguably hardest majors who have demonstrated skill and desire who get into med school every year), but you really just need passion and the right drive to make it happen. \n",

      "\n",
      "**What does it mean to be a member of CGSU?**\n",
      "\n",
      "A CGSU member is someone who wants to build power for graduate workers at Cornell, and has signed a CGSU Membership Card (in-person or online). Members of the union get updates about the union organizing drive and invitations to membership meetings, as well as information on how to get more involved. When CGSU makes a big strategic decision, elects members of our Steering Committee, or votes on a collective bargaining agreement, only members can vote on that. Being a member of CGSU is about showing your support for your colleagues, and having a say in your union.\n",
      "\n",
      "**What could a union, and a union contract, do for me as a graduate student?**\n",
      "\n",
      "A union, and the ability to negotiate a contract, means having tangible control over your own working conditions. Right now, graduate students have no meaningful control over University policies. The University can change stipend rates, healthcare benefits, and hour expectations without consulting graduate students. With a union, graduate students could negotiate over the substance of many University policies, and secure them through having a contract. This contract would be legally enforceable.\n",
      "\n",
      "A union is also a resource center for graduate students. Right now, there is very little done by the University to ensure that graduate students understand their rights as workers. This means that many graduate students don’t know what policies guide their working lives, from sick days and vacation days to programs like the childcare grant. Unions work to ensure that every worker knows what rights they have, and how to make sure that the contract is followed and their rights are protected, because a union is only as strong as its membership. If a graduate student feels like the University has treated them unfairly, the union will help (and is currently helping) grads to explore their options and navigate these processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "**What will a union prevent me from doing?**\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a question you might hear from the administration to make you think that you will have limited autonomy within a union. But a union contract is bargained by graduate students, with the administration. CGSU will never put limits on graduate students’ rights and conditions, because it works for grads. CGSU will make an effort to limit the University’s ability to change policies without grad students’ input and consent.\n",
      "\n",
      "**What is a “bargaining unit”, and am I in it?**\n",
      "\n",
      "The bargaining unit is the group of graduate students covered directly within the scope of contract negotiations. The bargaining unit was decided in an agreement between the University and CGSU in May, 2016, and includes all Teaching Assistant, Research Assistant, and Graduate Assistant positions under University Policy 1.3. This does not include hourly workers, nor does it include students on Fellowships (although we fought the University hard on both of these issues).\n",
      "\n",
      "Every graduate student in the bargaining unit will be able to vote in the upcoming recognition election, and will be covered under any contract that is negotiated between CGSU and the University. We know that graduate students will move in and out of the bargaining unit during their time at Cornell. However, regardless of your job title, if you have signed a union card, you are considered a member of the union, and can participate as much as you see fit.\n",
      "\n",
      "**What’s this election I’ve been hearing about?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Before a union can negotiate with administration and bargain a contract, it needs to be “recognized”. Cornell could have recognized CGSU on its own, but did not, instead calling for a “recognition election”. This is where graduate students in the bargaining unit get to vote YES or NO to being represented by CGSU as a union. If a majority vote YES, then the University has agreed to recognize CGSU as the union representing Cornell grads and begin bargaining a contract with us.\n",
      "\n",
      "**I’m an international student. Can I join CGSU? Are there any problems I will face because I am on a visa?**\n",
      "\n",
      "As an international student you are afforded all of the protections American citizens have when it comes to organizing and unionizing. Your visa will not be jeopardized by being a CGSU member. As a union member, you’ll also be part of an organization that will stand with you if you face any issues at the University.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why did the union subpoena my information?**\n",
      "\n",
      "We have an agreement with the administration that’s designed to ensure a smooth process over the coming months, and as part of that agreement, the administration agreed to release contact info so that we can reach out and talk to everyone who might be affected. The administration asked for the subpoena before they would release that information.\n",
      "\n",
      "To make this a truly democratic process, we need to be sure we give every one of our fellow co-workers the opportunity to inform this process and tell us how they would like to improve working conditions at Cornell. The University already has the ability to contact all grad students to dissuade us from unionizing, we have the legal right to be afforded the same opportunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "**What are union dues?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Union dues are money paid by members of the union for the purpose of maintaining a strong union. Collecting dues is one more way to ensure that graduate workers can have a strong union that can win a good contract and defend the rights of grad students. That’s what dues money is used for–winning and maintaining a good contract, and continuing to organize a strong union of grads that will have real power at Cornell and beyond.\n",
      "\n",
      "The campaign for recognition at Cornell is funded by the dues of union members in New York and across the country. Once we win our contract and have a union local, dues will sustain our union’s activities and service our contract!\n",
      "\n",
      "**So, how much do union dues cost?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Right now, there are no dues, and no cost. Once we win recognition from the University, and negotiate a contract, CGSU members will decide how much dues will be. That’s a decision we make, democratically, as members, and that as a member, you could make too. Union dues do not usually exceed 2% of total compensation.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Do you have any specific numbers on dues?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes! Again, right now, there are no dues. However, below is a table detailing the current NYSUT/AFT dues for 2016-17, that more than 600,000 AFT/NYSUT members pay.\n",
      "\n",
      "nysut-aft-dues-schedule\n",
      "\n",
      "**But I don’t want to pay any extra money!**\n",
      "\n",
      "We don’t want you to, either. A contract would never be bargained, much less approved by members, that didn’t ensure that we get more in compensation than go to dues. It would defeat a big part of what unions seek to do: to improve the material circumstances of its members.\n",
      "\n",
      "**I’m worried that my stipend will be cut to pay for others’ raises–will it?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Why would you vote to cut your own pay? We have people involved from a wide variety of fields such as Electrical Engineering, Physics, Biomedical Engineering, Anthropology and English. A democratic union like ours reflects the will of its membership, and no one is trying to pit some fields against others. This is about making improvements that benefit everyone and make it possible for us to do our best teaching and research work possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "**We already have GPSA (Graduate and Professional Student Assembly), so why would we need a union?**\n",
      "\n",
      "GPSA is an important part of Cornell’s shared governance system, and we’re not trying to replace that. But we think that concerns around our working conditions, benefits, and compensation are more appropriately addressed through a union, which has a stronger legal framework to negotiate and hold the administration accountable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, there are many grads that seek support navigating Cornell’s grievance policies. Having a union assures that grads will have the representation they need to navigate this onerous process, while working to improve it and bargain a more just system of due process for grad workers at Cornell.\n",
      "\n",
      "**My field is unique and we don’t want a cookie cutter approach.**\n",
      "\n",
      "Our goal as union members isn’t to conform every department and field to one exact way of operating. Rather, we want to be able to set baseline standards and expectations–and departmental administrators and faculty can figure out the best ways to meet them! Plus, it’s important to note that some things–like parental leave, dental and vision insurance, grievance policies, and workers’ compensation–simply can’t be resolved at the department level.\n",
      "\n",
      "We don’t think a cookie cutter approach would work either. That’s why it’s so important that we talk to everyone and have folks involved from every field. We’re building this union from the ground up, so this is an ideal time to get involved in shaping it.\n",
      "\n",
      "**We won’t be able to win anything anyway, right?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Through organizing efforts, grads have already won modest increases to the stipend, mandated that Cornell follow worker compensation laws, and improved and lowered health-care costs for grad spouses. This was all won through the modest pressure of student conversations about unionizing, imagine what we can win when Cornell is legally mandated to bargain with us over the conditions of our employment.\n",

      "God I wish I could tell my freshman year self this... You don't know how to study right now. In fact, almost every freshman STEM person I knew (and know) don't know how to really study. You were a smart kid and never had to really study probably. Things just came to you. A little review was all you needed to ace classes. Those days are over. To put this in perspective, I'm going to guess you do alright on most assignments and projects. When you attend class, you probably can follow what's going on and understand it. When you look at a problem and \"walk yourself through it\" you get it perfectly. But when exam time comes, you hit road blocks and bomb an exam or two.... why? \n",

      "You can imagine there are approximately three different tiers of knowledge for any given subject you'll face. There is (1) Novelty, (2) Familiarity, and (3) Understanding. You barely notice the novel realm because you're smart and quickly get into familiarity where you stay because up to now, that's all you've neeeded. \n",
      "\n",
      "Novel subjects/knowledge is stuff you haven't seen before. It's stuff you can barely follow (if follow at all) because it is so new. Imagine explaining to 2nd grade you sex or calculus and you'll get what I mean. \n",

      "Familiar subjects are where the vast majority of college students in your position end up. This is the realm of  \"I read the book and get it\" / \"I go to lecture and get it\" / \"I do the homework and get it\" / \"I hit a test and blank\". \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the hard truth though: **being 100% familiar with a subject means nothing about your understanding of that subject**. Read that a few times over. You can go to class, do all of your assignments, and then bomb tests. This is because thousands of people around the world mistakenly assume that because they are familiar on a subject, they understand it. **WRONG**.  Tests look at your understanding of a subject and not your familiarity with it. So if you don't get to the understanding level, you're S.O.L. on exams and will waste countless hours \"studying\" and still under achieving. \n",
      "\n",
      "Fortunately, getting to the understanding level is relatively easy with one specific change to your habits. When you're studying, **you need to persistently test yourself without any mental aids**. Attempt problems without notes, solution sets, or even the book. If you're prepping for an exam or a quiz or even doing homework, take a swipe at multiple problems without the help of notes, books, or solution sets. This forces you to come face-to-face with the areas where you lack understanding. Almost anyone (especially in Cornell Engineering) can walk themselves through a problem with notes or a book or follow a lecture. Not as many can be given a problem and without notes/book/solutions create a solution. By testing yourself on what you'll be tested on, you'll be able to immediately hone in on areas where you may be familiar with a subject but not understand it and focus studying habits there. Without doing this simple step, you'll spend days of your college life chasing your tail. I promise. This is the hard truth about studying. It doesn't sound fun, but do it and you will be amazed at how much more strongly you perform and how much lower the pressure will feel. \n",

      "&gt;Dear Members of the Cornell Community,\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;President Donald Trump’s recent executive order imposing a 90-day ban on immigrant and nonimmigrant entry to the United States from seven predominantly Muslim nations is deeply troubling and has serious and chilling implications for a number of our students and scholars. It is fundamentally antithetical to Cornell University’s principles.\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;Ours is a diverse and global university. More than a fifth of our students are from countries outside the U.S. and our students and faculty are involved in programs and partnerships around the world. Over the last few days, we have been in regular contact with our community members who are directly impacted by the executive order, including students on our Ithaca campus; students, postdoctoral fellows, clinical trainees, and faculty at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City; and students at Weill Cornell Medicine in Qatar. We are offering to each our assistance and unwavering support. Cornell will not compromise its admissions and hiring standards of excellence and will continue to solicit, accept, and process applications from international students from around the world, including from the impacted countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;We share the sentiments of many of our peer institutions who have voiced similarly strong concerns about the discriminatory nature of the executive order and the long-term damage it will have on our nation’s global leadership in research and education. The Association of American Universities (AAU), of which Cornell is a member, issued a statement yesterday, noting that the executive order \"is already causing damage and should end as quickly as possible.\" Cornell stands firmly with that statement, reaffirming our founding principle of \"any person, any study.\"\n",
      "Our collective voices may already be having an impact. A Trump administration official earlier today appeared to reverse a key part of the executive order, stating that those from the affected countries who hold green cards will not be prevented from returning to the United States, and several federal judges across the country have blocked, at least temporarily, the implementation of some provisions of the executive order. Still, there is tremendous uncertainty around this policy and how it might be implemented.\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;As a community, we acknowledge the psychological toll this executive order has taken, most notably on those from the impacted countries and their family members and friends. Cornell offers a number of resources (listed below) that I encourage all students, faculty and staff to use as needed.\n",
      "I also want to underscore the ongoing importance of demonstrating respect towards all community members inclusive of background, ethnicity, gender, religion, or political affiliation. There have been troubling reports of bias-related incidents on campus in the past few weeks. We thank members of the community who report incidents through the Harassment, Discrimination and Bias Reporting System. Reporting helps us to address these incidents swiftly.\n",
      "In closing, I want to underscore these important commitments to the Cornell community, including those I made to you in statements late last year regarding the uncertainty around federal immigration policy:\n",
      "Cornell will assist you if you are detained or prevented from re-entering the U.S. while traveling. See the specific resources and phone numbers listed below.\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;The university will continue to honor its commitments to all our current and future Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) undergraduate and graduate students. While it is still unclear how the DACA program will be impacted by Trump administration decisions, our commitments to these students remain firm.\n",
      "The Cornell Law School will provide legal assistance to undocumented Cornell students who may wish to consult with a lawyer about the implications of the federal administration’s policies for their immigration status. These legal advisory services will be free of charge. We are exploring the extent to which law school faculty can offer legal assistance to students and scholars from all Cornell campuses detained while traveling or prevented from entering the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;A dedicated team of law school faculty will also offer legal assistance in the form of representation for DACA students in potential deportation proceedings, should the need arise. There would be costs associated with this special legal representation service for DACA students, and a legal representative fund will be seeking contributions.\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;We will continue to protect the privacy of our student information and records from unauthorized or unlawful intrusion. The long-standing practice of the Cornell University Police Department (CUPD) has been not to seek immigration status information in the course of its law enforcement activities, unless related to criminal violations or threats of violent behavior. While Cornell representatives, including CUPD, will comply with lawfully issued subpoenas and warrants, it is neither the university’s practice nor expectation to function as an agent of the federal government regarding enforcement of federal immigration laws.\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;We have an obligation to assert our principles when policies and administrative decisions are contrary to those principles. Please join me in staying informed, engaged and intent on protecting the principles we hold dear.\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;Yours sincerely,\n",

      "Hey, graduating senior here! Here's my take on your questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) Pretty big. CS 1110 (intro to CS) is like 575 students and CS 2110 (OOP and data structures) is around 675 students this semester. Intermediate classes like CS 3410 (systems) and CS 3110 (functional programming) are more for majors/minors than for everyone, so the class sizes hover around 200 to 330 (depending on the semester). Upper level classes (4000-level) usually have 50 to 90 students in them, so not too many. There are a few exceptions (e.g. Machine Learning, which has 330 students I think. h u g e for an elective class.\n",
      "\n",
      "P.S. Course names are usually split around the middle: \"eleven ten\", \"twenty-one ten\", \"thirty-four ten\", \"thirty-one ten\", etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Quite easy if you go to office hours regularly, participate on online discussion regularly, ask questions in lecture regularly, etc. Anything to make yourself known! That said, not all professors will be super open/available, so maybe you won't be able to get to know *every* professor that you have.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) I think the other contributor (`sampsyo`) is a professor here, and students do research with him! He's pretty cool, and I think exemplifies the idea that it's not too hard to get research opportunities here as an undergrad. If you take some more specialized classes to concentrate in a direction (read: a few 4000+ electives), you'll probably gain enough experience to begin doing research with someone. That said, I've met students that had significant experience from high school and were able to jump into research right away. My point was that even if you had never done CS before Cornell, you could still learn lots in your first two years to begin doing research in your third year and even turn out a publication by the time you're a senior, I imagine.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Lots! There's the Association of Computer Science Undergraduates (ACSU), Women in Computing at Cornell (WICC, not just for women!), various project teams (CDS, CornellCup, CUAIR, CUAUV, etc.), and then just random small things that people do here and there (e.g. some of my friends had some sort of small computational finance thing called Sparkstone, etc.). Feel free to ask me about any of these!\n",
      "\n",
      "5) Yes, it's definitely possible. I've TAed a class for every semester I've been here except for the first. It's not *that* competitive but then again there are between 15 to 40 TAs for most CS classes and over 600 majors to choose from. CS employs around 350 TAs per semester to meet course demands, so that's not *too* many TAs, but it's also definitely not a small number. As long as you get a good grade in a class (e.g. an A or A+), you should be able to ask a professor if you can TA/consult for it (consultants are like TAs but just hold office hours, i.e. they may not actually hold discussion sections). Honestly sometimes grades matter a little less than willingness to help and general approachability, though. Nobody wants a perfect-A+ TA who can't explain things or is condescending to people.\n",
      "\n",
      "6) Some students do, not sure about most. I found one through personal connections, though that was before the creation of Handshake, which is a decent career services portal we have set up. There are also some internships just for freshmen! Microsoft, Google, and Facebook have some things like that (\"Google Practicum Intern\", \"Facebook U Internships\", etc.). Check those out, because they feed back into the real internships by the time you're a sophomore/junior!\n",
      "\n",
      "7) There's no difference in terms of what employers see. The difference to you is not in the degree requirements for CS, either. The only part that's different is the *other* requirements, like liberal studies, college requirements for distribution classes, foreign language requirement, etc. It's not really that different at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "8) CS 1110, CS 2110, CS 2800 (discrete math), and MATH 1920 (multi. calc) in Engineering, I believe. You need a 2.5 GPA across those classes and a C+ or higher in each class (might be a C-, idk) to affiliate. You can definitely do it after first semester with that credit. I also affiliated after first semester --- just make sure to take both CS 2800 and CS 2110/2112. Though I've seen from the people on this subreddit now that 2800 is apparently much harder. Back in the day I don't think anybody would have sweated a 2110 + 2800 combo, but who knows, times change. 2017 isn't 2014.\n",
      "\n",
      "9) Doable for sure, especially since you're already here. Again, your credit will make it easy. Just get decent grades and I think you have to write some small essay about why you want to do it? Just take Engineering requirement classes instead of the Arts &amp; Sciences (e.g. MATH 1920 instead of MATH 2220, MATH 2940 instead of MATH 2210, etc.). These numbers will become more familiar to you once you get here, I promise!\n",
      "\n",
      "10) These days, a LOT! I've heard that the number of CS majors per graduating year is now nearing 400, and only increasing. For reference, that's around 250 engineers and 150ish Arts students, and there are only 750 engineers in total. So a lot.\n",
      "\n",
      "11) I think it used to be more popular, but people do internships more often than they do co-ops in CS, I feel. There are always exceptions, but maybe I'm not the best person to ask for this. Almost everyone I know has never done a co-op.\n",
      "\n",
      "12) Lots of things! I'm not in a relationship, most of my free time is spent by myself. I play piano, I run outside, I enjoy the nature, I teach, I write (a lot), I play games, and I learn random things (usually not CS-related). Different people do different things for fun.\n",

      "I have to agree with this, but I feel the need to elaborate more on the harsh reality. If you failed gen chem, then you should seriously think about your ability to succeed on this track. Truthfully, gen chem may be one of the hardest classes you'll take in undergrad, but the ability to succeed in it is a good predictor of success later on. Gen chem requires you to be able to look at a problem, frame it in a certain perspective, and quantitatively answer it - not just memorize things. These are skills every doctor should have. If someone can't succeed in gen chem, then I wouldn't want them to be my doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, if you can remedy this over the summer, then give it a shot and do organic in the fall. Sometimes organic clicks for people in a way that gen chem doesn't. If that's you, then don't despair too much. But if you also struggle in organic, then this path may not be for you. It only gets harder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly, you should do some soul searching. Ask yourself why you want the MD. An MD has a tough undergraduate curriculum, requires immense work beyond your course work, another 4 years of school, a residency, and will put you in massive debt. Further specialization is going to cost you even more time. You won't start your life until you're almost 30. Are you following this path because the MD is the only way to meet your goals? There are lots of peripheral jobs that require different skill sets and less training that have just as much impact for patients. What are you good at? What occupations use those skills? You are young and at the beginning of your undergraduate education, now is the time to reflect on the past year and figure out how to move forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you intend to stick to pre-med, then this is the advice I give to all pre-med students.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Don't be a grade monger. Most programs only want to see you meet a certain minimum for your GPA. This ranges from 3.2 to 3.7 generally. They also want to see particular grades for particular classes (the weeding classes mostly). Fretting over points will just make the professors, teaching staff, and fellow students dislike you. It comes across as \"I'm not interested in improving or learning, I want you to give me more credit for what I've already done\". In the end, the extra points don't matter. The points students get for being annoying aren't changing their letter grades, and if they do, you probably could have gotten that letter bump through a more amicable relationship with the professor.\n",
      "2. Get a hobby, now. Find something that you are passionate about and get to it. It doesn't have to be relevant to being an MD, but most programs are looking for students with interests and personalities, not just boring academics slogging through courses. Committees want to see that you have interests and that you're able to pursue them on top of all the work you've been doing.\n",
      "3. Get involved with something. Research is probably the best in terms of something to put on your application, but any leadership or long-term volunteer position should work. Successful undergraduate researchers have all the skills committees want in their candidates. However, it might be hard to find a lab if you failed gen chem. The point is to find something 'professional' and commit to it for 2-3 years.\n",
      "4. Learn the material. Think about the problems. Don't just memorize everything! Make sure you understand the prerequisites for the class (that includes the math required to succeed). A lot of students struggle with 'weeding' classes because they require critical thinking and abstract thought. No offense to the biology classes (I'm a biologist myself), but they rely too much on memorization. Let's look at gen chem, which is basically simple algebra applied to word problems. Most students can answer direct questions like \"Calculate the hydronium ion concentration of a pH 9.00 solution.\" That doesn't require any thought, it's just a formula. Students tend to struggle when that same concept is now obscured in a word problem, or is part of a larger sequence of steps - like you're given several solutions and you need to calculate the pH after mixing them and achieving equilibrium. Students can do each individual step, but they're unable to do so in the context of a 'real' problem. This happens because they're not actually learning the material. Instead, they've learned a mechanical practice that this piece of information is used in that formula to get an answer. It's particularly heart-breaking when they need to perform simple algebra to rearrange an equation to get their answer and they can't do it because \"it wasn't in the practice problems\". Memorization is not enough. You need to actively think.\n",
      "5. View learning as expanding your model of the world. Frame all problems in the context of your model. This expands on the previous point. Education is cumulative. Particularly the pre-med track. You should have a nice little simulation of the world in your head and as you learn things, you add them to the simulation. Then when you see a problem, you plug it into your simulation and you use that solve the problem. For example, let's look at a 'simple' physics problem. You drop a ball down a frictionless slope onto a flat segment with a known coefficient of friction and a frictionless ramp at the end (something like this - \\\\_____________/). Does the ball go over the ramp? If not, how many times does the ball roll up and down the ramp? In your head, it's simple enough to imagine this situation. Either the ball goes over, or it doesn't and rolls around before coming to rest. Now you need to look at the math behind your simulation, the equations you learned, and figure out which ones to apply here. The first question is, does the ball start higher than the ramp itself? If not, you know the ball will never make it over and you're done. You don't even need math for that. If the ball does start higher, then the question is, does the ball have enough energy to overcome friction and the potential energy of the ramp? That's pretty easy to calculate too just based on how far the ramp is and how tall it is. If it can't make it, then you simply need to calculate how far the ball will roll before it loses all it's energy to friction and how many times it must cross the flat segment to achieve that distance. The key here is that you consider all the possible scenarios and then plug in the values from the problem to figure out which situation is true. As you advance in your field, you'll be able to account for nuances in your simulations of expertise.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. Get really comfortable with algebra. Be able to work with the alphabet soup and know how to solve for each variable. Substituting in the values and then solving for your variable confounds the algebra and stops you from thinking about how things actually relate to each other. Also, know how to exponentiate and what log(x) means.\n",
      "2. When looking at a problem, ask yourself what should happen. If you say \"I don't know\" then you don't know the material. If you say \"I know what should happen, but I don't know how to quantitate it\" then that means you know the abstract material and just need to locate the right formula. If you know what formula to apply, but not why, then you don't actually know what you're doing and should revisit the material.\n",
      "2. Does your answer make sense? Is it physically possible? If not, you're probably wrong. At least leave a comment that you know it's wrong.\n",
      "3. Do the homework by yourself. Do the pre-labs. It can be grunt work, but you're not gonna learn anything if you don't do it or if you rely on others to do it for you. After you've given it a shot, you can consult with others, but don't work with them from the start. Different professors give different quality homework though... Dr. Hines gives particularly useful homework in that she makes short, challenging problem sets. Textbook questions tend to lame, unoriginal, and minimally productive, except for the last 10 or so in a chapter.\n",
      "4. If you're still struggling, seek out chemistry word problems and tests. You want the open ended questions like you find on tests. Give them your best shot, then look at the answers. The only way to learn abstract thinking is to apply yourself. It's not something you can learn from reading the text and memorizing simple questions.\n",
      "5. Use the faculty and TA office hours. If you're struggling, then demonstrate to the professor that, by God, you're giving it your best. Prioritize the professor's office hours. Most of the gen chem TA's have never TA'd before and haven't taken gen chem since they were undergrads. They can help, but they're not as good as the professor. The professors have decades of experience. They can probably teach you better and have final say in your grades. Schmooze them. Do not nitpick them for points though. Also, remember that the TAs assign participation points at the end of the semester, which basically boils down to \"how annoying was this student?\".\n",
      "6. Be a nice enough and friendly enough person that the teaching staff know your name or at least recognize your face. Most students are wall flowers that you forget about once the course is over - they attend class, but they rarely speak and don't attend any of the extra stuff. The most memorable students are annoying and you never want to talk to or see them again. But our favorite students are the ones that try earnestly and seek out our help when they need it. Those are the ones that we subconsciously bias grades for and give them the extra point here or there because we know what they were getting at. The former we tend to be overly critical of and subconsciously take points from them because we doubt whether they understand the nuances of what they're doing.\n",

      "1a. I don't count credits beyond noting that it's a normal 3/4 credit class; it's typically otherwise irrelevant, since the time/difficulty of the class only loosely correlates. So, here is the rule of thumb on these \"normal\" 3/4 credit classes: 3 is pretty light, 4 is normal, 5 is heavy, 6 is very heavy, and more is basically unheard of. Most people do 4 or 5 a semester. Since it will be your first semester, I recommend going 4, so you can use that extra time to get acquainted with the campus and find the groups and clubs and friends you want to hang out with. Not only is being social important to your mental health, but it is way easier to meet people 1st semester than any time after. And a lot of clubs are really worth it, to the point that some even count as classes (I'm thinking some Cornell music groups and project teams here). As you already list 5 normal courses and 2 mini courses, you are pretty damn packed, and I would definitely not recommend adding more.\n",

      "1b. I notice you mention considering 2112. I recommend 2110, and here is why: People who I knew taking 2112 did not see the light of day, because there is a lot of work. This course is an honors course, sure, but it's not much of a resume booster because 1) it is intro level 2) it doesn't contribute to the honors degree/graduating with honors 3) being harder, it more likely to hurt GPA 4) you will be at Cornell and that is already basically honors. It's not an \"accelerated\" class either, in that you will not be able to skip any classes because of it, or be significantly better off in future classes. Do note that some people still swear by 2112, because it does indeed teach a lot more into the language and gets experience with bigger projects in early, but I personally think they are just trying to justify their decision. I took 2110 and never once regretted it, and I feel like I'm pretty accomplished.\n",

      "2a. I want to lay out some groundwork here: for each degree, there are 2 sets of requirements. I say this because I am a CS major and I have no idea where you think gov applies to CS; I too have AP gov credits, but they go to the Engineering degree.\n",
      "\n",
      "* The first is the degree requirements. This is set by the college. For CAS, this will include your language and a bunch of liberal distributions. For Engineering, this will include an intro programming language, an intro engineering course, and some basic math. You will need to look at the college sites to get the specifics for each, as they have changed slightly since I enrolled. The [Engineering handbook](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/academics/undergraduate/curriculum/handbook/) you will be given a hardcopy of when you come is great guide for both this and the second set of requirements; I don't know if CAS has something similar. AP gov credits definitely cover stuff here, and everything should be able to be double-counted between each different degree unless stated otherwise.\n",
      "\n",
      "* The second is the major requirements. This is set by the department. You will need to see their site (or the Engineering handbook equivalent) to see their policies. Typically, there is no double counting allowed *within* a major's requirements. For instance, CS needs some number of 4000 level courses and a project course. These both must be satisfied separately. But I'm pretty darn sure you can double count between majors and minors, unless stated otherwise (like when there is too much overlap between them, but this doesn't apply to math/cs).\n",
      "\n",
      "2b. Math courses can indeed fulfill technical electives for CS. I'm pretty sure it just needs to be 3000 level or higher. (Recall, though, that they don't double count with the external specialization.) And look [here](http://www.math.cornell.edu/m/Undergraduate/Major/major) about double majors between cs and math; they lay out how they facilitate the double major with double counting.\n",
      "\n",
      "3a. You seem pretty sure you can get those transfer credits without being 100% sure. I don't know your specific situation, but I'd think it would be unlikely to get much unless you already definitely know. It also becomes less likely with higher level courses. But then again, I personally didn't go for any transfer credit. Good luck trying. At the very least, call/email and confirm what you will get before making any rash class choices. [Here](http://as.cornell.edu/transferring-credits) is some stuff about CAS credit transfer, and [here](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/resources/registrar/upload/EN-Transfer-Credit-Form-2015.pdf) is some stuff on transfer from Engineering. Note the credit caps and certain inapplicabilities of the credit usage. In both cases you must have been on the college campus to take the classes and could not have taken them to fulfill highschool requirements. And as for AP, I'm pretty sure there is cap at something like 30 credits. (If I find a source I'll edit it in.) So that means your 12 exams will almost definitely not all get credit.\n",
      "\n",
      "3b. Most of the time exchange between the different intro linear algebra courses is allowed. But the 4000 level courses are definitely above the intro courses. You seem to have taken higher-level math so maybe your mathematical maturity is on point for that level, but for most people it is definitely not. Also, recall that whatever course fills in the linear algebra slot can't be reused elsewhere, so you'd be down a course elsewhere in the degree. I knew a senior electrical engineer that needed to take intro e&amp;m because she skipped it, so don't think over-shooting always gets you out of requirements. So I would recommend the intro course, but otherwise call/email Engineering to make sure the 4000 level would count properly. \n",

      "5 . If you meet the listed requirements, its pretty much a foregone conclusion that you will be accepted. For CS, the listed requirements basically boil down to getting above a C+ average in 3 courses that are curved to the B range, so it shouldn't be difficult.\n",

      "I went to Cornell and I'm at Princeton for grad school. I did CS. Having TAed for CS classes at both schools, I'm glad I chose Cornell for undergrad. The classes were just a lot better at Cornell, and there was a lot more variety. For example, there is not even a class on databases at Princeton, and the requirements to graduate are too lax, leading to people who are CS majors with lack of experience in certain classes unless they did outside projects. The same could be said about Cornell's curriculum at times, but at least Cornell _offers_ those classes. The one thing is that Princeton has very reasonably sized classes with only around 100-150 CS majors out of each class of 1250. For example, compilers this semester is 5-8 students. At Cornell, it was 60 students in the past and I hear well over 100 were enrolled this semester? Professors can get to personally know you at Princeton, which is nice (although quite possible at Cornell too, just requires more effort). Very few CS classes at Princeton fill up. Almost all of the CS classes at Cornell fill up instantly with waitlists. But I still had no trouble graduating with the classes I wanted, and most people are the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "Medians are about the same, and employment is mostly comparable as well as far as salary goes (see below for a discussion of companies). I wouldn't pick Princeton for the prestige if it's for CS. Honestly, think things through -- just because your degree name has one Ivy League name over another won't actually make a difference in the long run if you're not doing something on Wall Street (I worked at a bank on Wall Street one summer btw -- I could see that there was a palpable difference between HYP and Cornell there, a dichotomy which you wouldn't find at tech companies). Princeton undergrads also seem to work at different companies (Bridgewater, Two Sigma, Goldman, Bloomberg) for CS internships when compared to Cornell (I can't even count how many people I know who worked at Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, Google). Obviously there are exceptions to both but overall Cornell seemed to give very strong employment prospects via relevant tech internships that I don't see at the same level with Princeton undergrads.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you ever change your mind about what kind of engineering you want to do, Cornell has options. Princeton's engineering school outside of CS is meh. It's very theoretical/rigorous, which is great for sending kids off to grad school (many of the undergrad EEs here go off to grad school, for example). ECE at Cornell, for example, is very well structured, very challenging, and has excellent employment opportunities without just forcing you to work as a SWE at a tech company (although some do that). When I came to Cornell, I wasn't sure if I wanted to do CS or ECE, and one of the reasons I chose Cornell over other schools was the diversity of options and the strong/rigorous curriculum no matter what I ended up choosing. Princeton is certainly prestigious, but I get the vibe that that is because of its equivalent of the Arts and Sciences school's majors (and obviously Woody Woo). I don't think that the other engineering majors at Princeton are very practical at all, which is unlike what Cornell offers (a mix of theory and practice). Project teams and practical clubs also abound at Cornell, and getting that same experience or even level of choice at Princeton is nigh impossible. Like I said -- easier to find your niche at Cornell because there is no notion of \"mainstream\" hanging around the air.\n",
      "\n",
      "The social culture is a lot more forgiving at Cornell, too, and you can find what you want a lot more easily with a bigger school. Princeton undergrad culture is just super toxic IMO... I've hung around undergrads here and the eating club culture/pressure to not go independent is real. It just feels very cult-like here, with the residential colleges (you live in the same one for all four years), Zee groups, eating clubs, etc. Everything is sort of centered around \"being part of a group\", which IMO limits a lot of individual freedom that college is supposed to be all about.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, I must tout Princeton for having an insane amount of safety nets in place for their undergrads. They really care to make sure undergrads succeed at Princeton, which means that your residential college dean will be involved in your academic life if things go south (mental health issues, a bad class, etc.). People at Cornell wouldn't really care if you got a C in a class, but at Princeton they stop and email the professors to make sure that you're doing OK. That level of individual concern is really only something that a smaller school could do. OTOH I feel like Cornell helped me experience failure without softening the blow for me, which is an improtant experience to have early on. Princeton gives a much cleaner transition from high school, but they hold your hand a lot (and sort of restrict your freedom). They're very old-school/traditional in a lot of ways, and often wouldn't be willing to change something in the name of tradition. Cornell is a lot more free in that way, which is why I preferred it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mental health resources at Princeton are about the same as at Cornell, which surprised me, as Princeton should be able to do a lot better with the money they have. But it's not a priority for them I guess. About money -- Princeton definitely does a better job with financial aid via grants, so if that is a major concern then definitely I would choose the school that gives you better aid (comparing the schools on the finer points above doesn't make sense if one school is a clear victor in terms of financial choice). I mean going to Princeton won't hold you back, so if aid is the reason, then by all means go there. But if they are more or less comparable, then I would consider what I said above.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah anyway think things through and visit both schools! It's up to you, but because you asked here, I'm obviously going to tell you to pick the better school for what you want to do, which is unquestionably Cornell ;) YMMV.\n",

      "I don't think I met anyone at Cornell that had a win-lose mentality. My classmates and peers were always happy to collaborate on projects, problem sets, studying, etc. I very frequently lent notes or borrowed notes from students in the instance of missing lectures, for example. I shared notes or borrowed notes from older students who had taken courses that I was currently enrolled in, etc. I would say the collaborative mentality is much more prevalent, largely because Cornell is very difficult. You oftentimes need support to succeed, and people recognize that, so they're willing to support their peers and friends, academically or otherwise. If you try to do Cornell academics alone, you're going to have a bad time.        \n",

      "  \n",
      "  \n",
      "Grade deflation itself isn't prevalent, but getting good grades is difficult. I was an econ major who took a lot of physical sciences and math courses (I was confused and undecided for awhile), and I only experienced one course that was \"curved down\" (deflated). The way curved grading at Cornell typically works is quite simple. The professor will take all of the raw scores at the end of the semester and identify the median grade. Say, for example, the median is a 70, but the professor doesn't want 50% of his/her students to receive a C- or lower. Therefore, the prof will decide on a grade that he/she believed should be the cutoff point. In large, freshmen, intro courses (think general chemistry, calculus, physics, etc.), this is usually a B-. I've heard instances of some courses curving to a C+, and that's really rough but generally uncommon. In upper level courses, it's much more common for the median grade to be a B or B+. That means 50% of students will receive a grade above the median, and 50% of students will receive a grade below the median. How far above or below is based on how many standard deviations you were above or below the original, raw median (or mean). I hope that makes sense. That said, (almost) everyone at Cornell is brilliant, so keeping up with the average Cornell student is very difficult. You have to put in a lot of work, but if you do the work and keep up with the material, you should be rewarded.   \n",

      "&gt; Cornell is notorious for mental health/stress issues, how prevalent is this?  \n",
      "  \n",
      "  \n",
      "I'd say it's prevalent, but I would suggest it's no more prevalent than any other top-20 school with very high achieving and highly ambitious students. It's a stressful environment. Students are usually accustomed to being in the top 1-5% of their high schools, or even their districts. And then they get to Cornell and realize they are no longer in the top 1-5% of performers. This can weigh on you emotionally. Also, a lot in your life changes when you go from high school to college. You move away, you live in a new place, you have to make new friends, you're not with your family, you have new challenges (social challenges, academic challenges, eventually job/professional challenges). And, being 18-22, you're just susceptible to mental illness and stress. None of these factors are unique to Cornell. You will find these at any college, and especially at any prestigious college. Don't let anyone tell you Cornell is a \"suicide school.\" We unfairly received that reputation after a string of suicides, I believe in 2005-2008, but the Cornell student body experiences suicide at rates similar to institutions of similar size. I will say, one thing that is somewhat unique to Cornell is the weather. The long winters without a lot of sunlight can weigh on  you. I moved from South Florida and definitely experienced seasonal affective disorder during my first bad winter in Ithaca. There are ways to handle this though. Counseling, peer support, making healthy decisions, getting outside any time the sun comes out, etc. There are ways to learn to enjoy the winter, and if you're already from a similar climate, you have an advantage.       \n",

      "&gt; What would you consider to be the biggest drawback for Cornell? And what's the best thing about Cornell?  \n",
      "  \n",
      "  \n",
      "This is hard to answer. I think most students will say the location (no major nearby cities/airports) and the weather (tied to the location). I personally loved Ithaca and eventually fell in love with the winter. And, the other seasons are *incredibly* beautiful. It really is an amazing environment with so much natural beauty. Going to college in a college town is a great experience for a young person. And most Cornell students graduate and move to a large city, so they'll have their whole lives to experience that. I think my personal biggest drawback of Cornell was the socioeconomic diversity. Cornell is incredibly diverse in just about every way except for socioeconomic diversity (IE: family income), and this is largely a product of the prestigious higher education industry rather than a product of Cornell policy, though Cornell could certainly improve its policies to attract and sustain more income diversity. Basically, Cornell students are overwhelmingly upper middle class/upper class, with 10% of Cornell students coming from the top 1% of earners in the US (roughly 600,000 dollars of annual income, or more). If you don't fall into this group, you can feel a bit left out. That's not to say you won't have friends, or people will treat you differently. Even wealthy people are genuine and down to earth. But, when you're staying on campus for spring break and some of your friends are flying to Spain or South America, the income inequality really does show. Sort of along the same lines, I think Cornell's biggest strength is the diversity, in all aspects. Diversity of coursework/academic departments, diversity of the student body and where they come from/what they do (everyone at Cornell seems to have an interesting/exciting talent or perspective on life), diversity of buildings, diversity of activities, diversity of Ithaca, etc. I know this is a cliche answer, but I really do believe it. Also, my other biggest  Cornell strength is Cornell Hockey. Our team was really strong this year (finishing #3 in the natioanl standings and #1 in our conference). We also have some of the most supportive and rowdiest fans in the country. Lynah Hockey Rink is famous for the atmosphere, and if you get the chance, definitely check it out, even if you hate sports/hockey. It's amazing. \n",

This is so important and you will need to do this even if you don't decide to stay at Cornell! The most effective ways for me (your mileage may vary):\n",

      "* finding a group of people that I loved living with. On a whim, I checked out housing co-ops and found that they were filled with caring, smart, and talented people who were interested in more than the rat race.

      "\n",
      "* taking at least one \"fun\" class each semester. Sometimes they were able to fulfill the liberal studies requirements that the CoE had when I was there, sometimes they weren't. But maintaining my intellectual curiosity by taking classes that involved actually creating something (sculpture, narrative writing, creative writing, wood construction (RIP)) or learning something completely frivolous (human bonding, mushrooms, wine and beer, food science 101) was so critical to keeping sane for me. One of the best things about Cornell is that you can take a class in literally any subject, and you'll be taught by one of the leaders in the field.\n",
      "\n",
      "* being part of one or two clubs that allowed me to have *structured* time to hang out with others. For me, this was a music ensemble. For others, rock climbing, or joining a D&amp;D campaign, or being part of a religious group, or playing a club sport were all extremely worthwhile.

Chilled on the fourth floor of the museum, looking out over the lake on a nice day? Listened to a chimes concert from the top of the clock tower?

If you don't know how to get one, just start asking people you have classes with or are on a project team with. I went through my undergraduate work on my own because I wanted to prove something to myself. But that was stupid. It will make your life infinitely easier to have a few people to bounce questions off of. Just be extremely wary of academic integrity violations (no copying!)\n",

Here are my suggestions that are specific to you:\n",

Instead, focus on giving yourself 8-10 solid hours every day of working without distractions (including class time!), and then when that's done, stop.

      "Many professors and faculty are self-proclaimed anticapitalists, anarchists, socialists, and communists. You will spend many classes ~~being indoctrinated~~ having discussions about the plight of labor vs ~~evil~~ management. The closest thing to \"business\" you will get from ILR is Human Resource Management. Human Resources is basically just management's department to deal with labor in order to prevent lawsuits. Basically, give the employees just enough so they don't unionize. They also handle other tasks like compensation, benefits, hiring and recruitment. ILR likes to play up the role of HR to save face, [but they're not exactly cutting edge business professionals.](http://cunooz.com/2013/09/26/ilr-undergraduate-dreams-of-becoming-hr-professional/) In most companies, HR is an isolated department that plays very little role in the core business operations.\n",

      "Everything else either prepares you for law school or prepares you to go work for a nonprofit like a union or for a social justice political campaign or something. If you're interested in finance and entrepreneurship, these careers couldn't be further from what you want. In ILR, you will take law classes and law-like classes. But they are all focused on labor law. If you're interested in doing any other type of law, the stuff you learn (besides for law 101 stuff and study habits) will hardly be applicable. It will give you soft-knowledge and preparation to do well in law school. But do you really need to spend 4 years to prepare for a 3 year degree? It's reading and writing. Yeah, the workload in law school can be demanding, but it's not rocket science.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can also enter law school from any major. You just need a high GPA and a high LSAT. That's it. Going to ILR just to go to law school is a waste of a bachelor's degree in my honest opinion. But still, the majority of ILR'ies end up at law school sooner or later. Maybe they do a few years in HR first, but eventually, many of them will realize how shitty HR is and go to law school to escape the field.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. ILR admissions stretching the truth of what their program actually is to prospective applicants by trying to convince them that it's some magical interdisciplinary program that will prepare you for both business and law. To their credit, it's a solid (even if manipulative and dishonest) strategy since  high school students are used to having a multidisciplinary education without specialization. In high school, you take classes in a full range of topics (math, science, English, history, language, and electives like psychology, economics, etc. etc.) When it comes time for college though, you need to start specializing. Sure, you can take general education courses to fulfill those requirements for 1-2 years, but it's really in your best interest to pick a path sooner than later. It makes sense why prospective students would be allured by a course of study that allows them to have it all without having to narrow their focus.\n",
      "   1. The problem is that it's not \"magical.\" In your 4 years, you're expected to develop knowledge and skills within your discipline so you can apply what you learned in the workplace. ILR though, like other non-specialized liberal arts programs, do not set you up for that. You will graduate with soft-skill knowledge about topics most people don't care about and hardly any skills. Hence, law school or graduate school are often times your only option.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Alumni and current students talking about how many ILR students go to actual business/finance careers.\n",
      "   1. Is this true? Yes. But what they don't tell you is that these students supplemented their ILR curriculum with as many finance and business classes as they could get into (as well as business/finance extracurricular). If they only did ILR, they would not have a chance in hell. So it wasn't that ILR allowed them to do business, it's that ILR didn't get in their way so much that they couldn't do business/finance on the side. Indeed, the ILR curriculum, though as toxic as it may be for a would-be business professional, is not tremendously rigorous in terms of number of required courses. You can even replace some of your higher level ILR requirements with some approved business courses. So basically, you bullshit your way through your ILR courses, pretend to share the same anticapitalist and antimanagement sentiment as your professors, and put your honest effort into the business courses you're taking on the side. This is a very common strategy among ILR students. Even if it's possible, why even have to put up with ILR in the first place if you can just take the business courses without the ILR crap? Instead, if you applied to Dyson, the business classes would be your main focus - you can concentrate in multiple business concentrations like finance AND entrepreneurship, or even take other useful non-business courses such as courses that focus on programming, data science, math, and statistics (stuff that are basically required for new finance recruits these days anyway).\n",

Algorithms was a slap in the face. It was a hard pill to swallow that hard work can mean jack shit as I looked at my C on my final.\n",

I can’t lie for the life of me. “Why did you stay at Cornell for an extra summer?” “....I failed a course.” “Why were you Microsoft Rep for only half a year?” “....I got replaced.” “Why did you choose this company instead of a gaming one? Your resume is full of gaming stuff.” “I like the company environment. I like the products you make.” “Really?” “No, I just want a job, man.”\n",

You are smarter than a lot of people out there. All of that hard work from college didn’t go to waste. Who gives a fuck about GPA? I’ve learned discipline. I’ve truly truly learned the value of money after working this long dining hall hours. Stressful moments at work? Ha, nothing compared to Cornell. Recently, I’ve just paid off all my student loans, but I also put in a huuuuuge amount to my retirement funds. And yet I still have enough to go to trips all across the country this year. I’ve flown to LA and DC this year alone, and I’m going to Japan in a few months. I get 20 vacation days a year already. Not that unlimited vacation days bullshit most tech companies do—people never take full advantage of that. I know people still struggling in the rat race. I know people so smart beyond my imagination who are struggling and dropping out of grad school. \n",

The people who aren’t talking are the ones in your same exact position. The fuckups like you and me.\n",

      "I hate the Cornell Daily Sun with a burning passion so much, that nearly everyone who knows me in real life and who follows me on snapchat will likely consider that one of my personality traits. Here's a short list explaining why the Cornell Daily Sun is a fucking garbage publication: \n",
      "\n",
      "* It's not even daily, but they still call themselves the Cornell Daily Sun. Like what the fuck. \n",
      "\n",
      "* **Sex on Thursdays**. Who the fuck approved this? Whenever I post the headlines of this section on my snapchat, I always will get a reply from at least one person who refuses to believe that it's real. None of this shit is remotely interesting or even humorous, and it sure as fuck isn't classy. No one wants to fucking read stories about how this one person had a hookup with a dude and it turned awkward and she had to see him every day in Psych 1101 for the rest of the semester, every fucking week. What kind of middle school bullshit are you churning out? Every week its the three stories: Some gossippy bullshit about this girl kinda humble-bragging that she had sex this one time with a super hot dude and it wasn't great that leads into a tirade about how men can't make her orgasm but women can, a list of reasons why sex is fun (because this needed convincing) or why drunkenly hooking up with a laundry list of dudes isn't a bad thing, or another generic rant about rape culture. It just seems like the incoherent ramblings of an insecure bisexual who wants to make sure everyone else knows how much sex they have. \n",
      "\n",
      "* I'm taking a single bullet point to complain about a specific person's op-eds. I consider myself moderately liberal, but even taking into consideration that Cornell is a college, and a pretty liberal one at that, I couldn't take some of these articles seriously. Last year, there was literally an editorial written by a woman who was **complaining that when bouncers knew that she was underage and still let her into bars in collegetown, she felt indebted to them and argued this was sexist**, while acknowledging that there were nights when her guy friends were left at the door and her friends and she were let in. She went on to counter the argument to \"simply not drink underage\" by arguing that drinking was a part of college life, and she had a right to *break the law* to meet that goal. I don't think I'm even exaggerating that much, read it for yourself [here](https://cornellsun.com/2018/03/26/hubsher-can-i-see-your-i-d/). \n",
      "\n",
      "* The rest of the columns: A lot of these have the unique and distinctive style of *garbage fucking journalism*. Use of a bunch of buzzwords and phrases that may be independently coherent, but as a whole don't really say much. They're usually written intentionally over-provocative in attempts to make the author stand out and give themselves a sense of superiority. It reeks of modern YouTube/Vine \"look-at-me\" culture that I fucking abhor. Each of these \"texts\" is written with a tone of absolute disgust when its evident that they're actually completely ambivalent to the issue. Another lot of these have absolutely fucking nothing to do with Cornell, or really anything in general. I read some article the other day about some girl who got her credit card number stolen through some phishing scheme or something that played out like that one English paper I shat out in the class it was due freshman year of high school. Nothing was really written about how to avoid scams in the future or how to go about resolving a credit card dispute, or really anything of worth to the reader. Some girl just wrote about the one time she got her credit card number stolen, and then what she got for breakfast afterward or something. \n",
      "\n",
      "* Batshit crazy opinion pieces. There was an article last year written by 3 non-CS grad students that called for the CS department to introduce a Sociology/Diversity Requirement because they were worried about AI being racist. Here's a excerpt from the first paragraph of their article, \"It's August 4th, 2025, and the Chicago Police Department, now relying heavily on facial recognition artificial intelligence software, wrongly identifies and arrests Barack Obama.\" Does no one read these? A newspaper like The Cornell \"Daily\" Sun shouldn't be treated like Twitter, where anyone can say whatever the fuck they want. Someone needs to proof-read this shit before it gets sent to the presses. \n",
      "\n",
      "* The new columnists this year. I thought it would be better with most of the columnists I hate graduating in the spring of 2018. Boy I was fucking wrong. A lot of these new columnists are freshmen or sophomores. How these people got columns freshman year is beyond me; probably some kind of nepotism, especially when you read the kind of stuff they shit out. Basically every complaint I had about the rest of the columnists but taken to the absolute extreme. Like an extreme I didn't even know about. Even my high school paper in South Korea whose main contributors could barely speak English at a 7th grade level had better articles. Nothing interesting is discussed, anything that is discussed is taken to some political extreme, and a lot of opinion articles are written about events that are covered in a report article in the same issue of the paper. This may not seem like a huge deal, but it really is. Its tough to tell if an article about some event is meant to be a report or an opinion at first glance (especially if the opinion piece has the headline and the report doesn't), and it makes the whole paper seem ridiculously political at points and in bad taste. \n",
      "\n",
      "* The Movie section. I know art is subjective, but I happen to know a lot about the filmmaking industry. Not that I can make a good film myself, I just happen to have lots of sources where I can learn how films are made, the kinds of politics that go on behind blockbusters, what a director of cinematography looks for in cameras when trying to shoot a horror vs an action film, and why Casablanca is a great movie. But I can say with absolute certainty that nearly half the campus could be a better film critic than whoever they have at the \"Daily\" Sun. Constantly getting facts and general information wrong is just the tip of the iceberg. Also, in my opinion they all have terrible taste, but again, that's completely subjective. \n",
      "\n",
      "* Anti-Greek Life articles. I hate Greek Life roughly ten times more than the average Cornellian, but the number of articles complaining about Greek Life that all say the same fucking thing is ridiculous. If it was once a semester, or whenever some frat pulled some stupid stunt, I'd be okay, but every other fucking week is too much man. \n",
      "\n",
      "* The Sudoku Section. The quality of this thing fluctuates more than my cardiograph when The Cornell \"Daily\" Sun comes up in conversation. Some days they're ridiculously easy, some days they're actually difficult, usually the former.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I could rant about this for another ten thousand characters, but let's face it, no one read past this point so I'm gonna stop because I'm nearing the character limit for comments (also because I'm gonna fail my algo prelim on Thursday, and really need to stop procrastinating studying). \n",
      "\n",
      "But, I will give credit where credit is due. I think there are a couple of good writers on the team. I especially like DongYeon (Margaret) Lee's stuff because I think she raises questions that are remotely thought provoking, and makes arguments that are interesting and have actually have the capacity to change my mind. They also are always about life at Cornell instead of some fucking bullshit. Take a note other writers, because Cornell fucking deserves it already.  \n",

Then, they work to expand their right to \"practice religion\" to include things like depriving gays from being gay in the workplace. That's why I related the two. Here's a great explanation of this, and how it relates to workplace protections and the GOP: [https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/403951-16-states-ask-supreme-court-to-legalize-discrimination-against-lgbtq](https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/403951-16-states-ask-supreme-court-to-legalize-discrimination-against-lgbtq).\n",

It was legal, and it happened.** Your rhinoceros example is such an absurd false equivalence that I won't even address it.\n",

      "And to say that my safety won't be threatened for being publicly gay, or that people won't stop me, is just such a massive denial of reality.

      "\"In 2016, 6,121 hate crime incidents were reported --an increase of five percent from 2015. Of the 6,121 incidents reported,**1,076 were based on sexual orientation bias and 124 were based on gender identity bias.** These numbers reflect a two percent and nine percent increase, respectively. ... However, these numbers likely represent only a fraction of such cases, given that reporting hate crimes to the FBI is not mandatory. Thousands of law enforcement agencies throughout the country did not submit any data. And while the number of jurisdictions reporting hate crimes data increased to 15,251 in 2016 from 14,997 in 2015, this is still less than the 15,494 agencies that reported in 2014. The lack of mandatory reporting means that the FBI data, while helpful, paints a very incomplete picture of hate crimes against LGBTQ Americans.\"\n",

These are very real threats that individuals face daily, because of something they never chose for themselves.
