	100 sample questions that were assigned type 0 (11721 total questions with this type) :
		1. How difficult is it playing against Andy, one of the best returners in the game, despite your big serve? How do you have to change your game against Andy?
		2. How did that compare to the oppressive heat in Melbourne or the humidity in New York? Is it getting near that?
		3. Does she come to matches or practice?
		4. Does an example come to mind where you changed your strategy or approach with a particular player?
		5. Could you talk a little bit about your fiveset record. Today was your 49th, which is the most by a long way. It puts you second on the alltime list of fiveset matches played and you have a very good record. What is it with you and fiveset matches? Are you pleased you have such a good record in the fifth set?
		6. How difficult in your mind is it, given the status of Caroline, who hurt her knee, hopefully she's able to go tomorrow, but does that affect your preparation at all?
		7. Given that there are no teenage men in the top 100 of the world rankings, do you think that's more motivation for kids to go to college a year or two? Do you think more guys should follow the route you took?
		8. You've been able to do something that not a lot of players have been able to do. You were No.1 in the world, dropped down to about 65 and have been able to make it back. What tactics have you used over the years to be able to reemerge the way you have?
		9. Is it hard for a guy from Scotland -- I know you were in Barcelona for a while -- to get used to a place like Miami?
		10. This is the first sort of more high-profile relationship you've been in. Obviously you're engaged now to another athlete. Caroline Wozniacki was here with Rory McIlroy earlier in the week. Is that something you had to get used to, having a new dimension of attention towards you?
		11. You've never used it once?
		12. You used to be one of the kids in the crowd yourself?
		13. You usually play on center court everywhere you play. Last two you played on Grandstand. Any differential going back on center getting used to a different court?
		14. You hadn't actually used the technology up till that point?
		15. You mean you used to come as a spectator when you were younger?
		16. You used to?
		17. Is it tough to get used to the humidity here, too?
		18. You used it to your advantage?
		19. You talk about experience. Are these the matches you don't want to be slipping up in, you should be winning these matches and moving forward in the tournament?
		20. Losing the No.1 ranking, is winning the title compensation for that, or are they just two entirely different things?
		21. So how about Radwanska, the Polish girls?
		22. Is it fair to say you're a player that's not particularly bothered by the wind? You had good results in Miami, and that's probably one of the worst places for wind.
		23. Is it fair to describe that performance as your best of the tournament so far from your point of view?
		24. Is it fair to say you're possibly more familiar with the conditions out there than you are in Wimbledon Centre Court conditions?
		25. Because it obviously means you have a play - to win this title - seven in 12 days. Is that fair?
		26. Fernando described it as a very strange match. Is that fair?
		27. You seemed fairly comfortable out there today. Is that fair?
		28. You seemed happier with your performance out there today; is that fair?
		29. On the coaches front, you have access to Darren, Rochey, two of the best in the business.  Is it fair to say you've got the best deal in tennis at the moment?
		30. Is it fair?
		31. Kvitova played 35 minutes, men play four hours. Is it fair to compare or not?
		32. I guess you were taking control by the time she actually started to suffer. Is that fair?
		33. He started to play particularly well around about the fourth game in the second set. Did you find your level rising as a result of that? Is that something that often happens?
		34. How was it different than other years you came on? Is there a sense after having won the French that history is behind you?
		35. When did you become an American citizen?
		36. Obviously they weren't weighing on your mind?
		37. Obviously a big satisfaction for you?
		38. Obviously since he walked off the court, have you two caught up?
		39. You constantly say and your bio says how much you like to play in the United States and everything. Obviously no visa problems, but can you give other reasons plus that or whatever?
		40. Obviously with Nathan and Giselle and everything, did you spend much time with Lleyton in the summer?
		41. You said a big part of what you worked on was the mental side of things. Obviously today winning your first title, how much of that improvement in your mental side of your game do you attribute to coming to this point and now winning a title?
		42. Because of that, the comments or criticism that you received, was it hurtful in that regard? It seemed like you went in with different intentions than they seemed to think you went in with.
		43. Is that kick serve that you made about six straight points on, is that your specialty?
		44. The serve and volley, is that a case of experimenting because of the score?
		45. You have been working with new coach after Australian Open. Just wanted to know how is the relation with him and how is the cooperation between you two?
		46. Just wanted to ask you if you have any particular mentality going up against another left hander?
		47. How about blood testing? The ITF records tell us in the whole of 2011 there was only 18 blood tests taken of the top players. How often would you or Andy or Roger or Rafa be blood tested?
		48. You have made it here two years in a row now. A lot of players have said it's harder to stay at the top than to get there for the first time. How difficult is it going to be to keep getting back here year after year?
		49. How difficult is it going to be to sort of put this out of your mind and focus on Wimbledon?
		50. Just to follow up, it was a very, very strange match. All the points were very, very long, three hours. You called your coach twice. I just wanted to know if you could just give us an idea what was going on in your mind? Because after the first set you trailed 4-0, and then you really fought back. You seemed to have a lot of problem. You broke serve well, but in terms of holding your serve, it seemed to kind of let you down. I wanted to know what your thought process was as the match was going along.
		51. You wanted to finish today?
		52. I just wanted to ask how it feels to be in your first quarterfinal here?
		53. I wanted to ask you physically you are okay? Because end of the first set and beginning of the second set it was like you were struggling breathing.
		54. Completely different topic: A few days ago Fernando Gonzlez retired. He's planning a farewell tour in Chile. You're one of the names he would be like to be on that tour, Andy Roddick. I wanted to ask you any chance if you will be going to South America at the end of the year?
		55. I wanted to ask you what you think of the new, slimmer Mardy Fish? Still remains to be seen how he'll do here. He says he feels like a completely different player now.
		56. I just wanted to know, after these two hard matches, how do you feel physically? You are playing Ferrer next.
		57. I wanted to ask if there's any fatigue today coming off the victory Monday in Beijing?
		58. He wanted the shoe?
		59. I just wanted to ask you, did you enjoy the support from the Sydney crowd today?
		60. Congratulations on your third victory here and for your great career. I think that today you won your 40th tournament on clay. You've got 23rd Masters 1000. I wanted to ask you, of all the finals you played and you won them, do you remember this has been the most simple final to beat of all the Masters 1000 that you have?
		61. You wanted to win this game very much?
		62. He wanted you to go in Paris?
		63. I just wanted to ask you, how have you found it throughout your career dealing with the crowd at Roland Garros?
		64. I wanted to ask you something: In Roland Garros you took him to the limit in the first set, I think it was?
		65. Just the whole court either side, right?
		66. Who is in your corner now that he's not there? Who do you turn to with him absent?
		67. Nadal has had a quite easy victory today. You've had to play three sets. Have you used a lot of your physical energy today?
		68. There have been some improved statistics of play from IBM this year. Have you used any of that in your preparation for the games?
		69. Last night's match was a very physical match. Coming back again to play today, how tough is that to play another match so soon after last night?
		70. How important do you think it was, that game that you played just before the rain delay, to get the momentum going for you again and then you could build on that after you came back?
		71. How important do you think the secondset tiebreaker was?
		72. Do you think your opponent will have a significant disadvantage? They haven't gone on yet. If it was flipped, would you feel a little bit of a disadvantage if you were in that scenario?
		73. When you come to a tournament like this, you've won it a couple of times, do you have a better feeling about it, more secure feeling that you've done well here?
		74. Starting of this new association that you have started, can you comment on something?
		75. There's already been quite a significant number of heroics out here, the first three days, not least yesterday when players were playing in terrible heat, some called at 11:30 at night. How tough is it to actually win this event, in terms of winning this event so early in the year, given all the conditions, extremes, to actually go out and give it your best so soon in the year with the temperatures we get sometimes down here?
		76. How tough is your opponent tomorrow, Pennetta?
		77. Like you said, most of the players came from Fed Cup, and this is a tournament that's fairly off the beaten path, you know, not next door. How tough is that commute and stuff?
		78. How tough is it to keep an attacking kind of sensibility when you've got guys who play so powerful from the baseline? Do you have to actually force yourself to...
		79. How tough is it to adjust, you know, from one surface to the next?
		80. For women you have your fitness training that you do, weight training. Probably more than men you're also judged maybe on how you look. How tough is that to deal with?
		81. After the French, some said maybe you should have given more credit to your opponent who defeated you. How tough is it, after a loss, to analyze the defeat and assess credit for your opponent?
		82. Back to Mandela. No other great leader has had such an interest in sports. He said sports has a transformative quality. In your many years traveling the globe in this sport where the locker room has Croatians and Spaniards, Japanese, so forth, can you talk about whether tennis touches people's lives, whether it is transformative in any way?
		83. We are getting used to seeing you in quarterfinals of Grand Slams now. Are you used to this yet?
		84. How can you beat him?
		85. Andy, when you said a bit of an unprofessional decision on my part to go on, you're talking about going on today and not continuing last night, right?
		86. Right or left?
		87. You really don't go anywhere just to get some work in. A lot of players come here to get in a few matches and get ready. You come to win, right?
		88. I think you get Stan next, right?
		89. You still like the Olympics too, and obviously that's part of what's going on with it, too, right?
		90. Your parents are Polish, right?
		91. You've already had a tennis match in your series in China, right?  So you've already had a major event in China, Shanghai.

		93. They're back home in Poland?  They don't come with you, right?
		94. Sometimes it's not about playing well. It's about the fight and the experience and all that, right?

		96. You have a wildcard into this event, right?
		97. You did so well, like in Indian Wells, so close with Novak. In Miami you also played really well. You're playing right there with the top players. That must give you a lot of confidence, right?
		98. You owe him now, right?
		99. Your wife/coach, right?
		100. Right or left foot?

		31. As the tournament progressed and you advanced through the draw, did you give much thought to the 50th anniversary of Althea Gibson?
		32. Obviously your tennis is speaking for itself. Your dancing afterwards, did you give thought into that?
		33. Serena had quite a domineering run to the final; for you, there was a lot of scratching, a lot of clawing, a lot of fighting to get there. As a result, you know, a lot of people picked her to win. In a way, those hard battles you had to go through, do you think that in a way you drew confidence from the fact that you've been able to have your back against the wall the way you have and fought and scratches and so forth. A, did that give you confidence? And B, if you can just kind of reflect back on not only today's match, but also on the tournament and what you've learned about yourself.
		34. Sounds like a silly question, but you have a one-two combo with your first and second serve, maybe the best on tour, why do you and other guys take something off the second serve simply to get it in knowing that you've then reduced your chance of winning the point? We've actually crunched the numbers, and it actually comes out the other way sometimes.
		35. Can you explain how Wimbledon is different this year given you've got the Olympics coming up?
		36. What does she tell you?
		37. On that, though, Li Na put out her book in English and then she won a big tournament, the Australian Open, an Englishspeaking country. So when are we getting English version of your book?
		38. So when you think of yourself out there in the women's semifinals on Thursday, what is your reaction?
		39. So when you were young, is she the one who took you to tournaments, to practice, and all of that?
		40. As you can see, you are breaking records every day. So when you went there, which is the toughest opponent: the one that's at the other side of the record book, the history books?
		41. So when you and Larry got together in the off-season, besides recovering physically, the illness, what were you talking about as to what you want to do this year?
		42. I'm not sure you understood the question.  You are good at watching someone and doing what they do.  So when a coach in serious training shows you you should do this instead of this, are you better at picking that up than maybe somebody else would be?
		43. So when was the last time you hit a service winner and two aces at break point down to win a set?
		44. So when would you say would be official?
		45. So when was the first occasion in your career you started playing on grass?
		46. So when you left the court and you saw them -- I assume you've seen them since you won?
		47. You talked in Australia about what Andre said to you in December. So when you came back to Las Vegas this time and he saw your great result, what are some of the things he had to say to you about that?
		48. Who are you representing? You're playing here as a German?

		53. How big was that double fault in the game with the break point?
		54. How big was that mentally for you to pull out the tiebreak over the 18yearold Croatian the other day? That was a long, backcourt match.
		55. You come here, you stay in a house and not a hotel, you're not in a big city, and you now presumably have three days off. How big a deal are these different rhythms, just different vibes that this place has as opposed to the other three slams?
		56. How important was it have a tough workout after the walkover last round?
		57. Are you surprised by the results of the tournament so far? For example, the departure of the Williams sisters from the tournament?
		58. Also in the second set when he broke you, did you have the sensation that the match depended on you?
		59. Also, I believe this is the first time someone has saved match point in the decisive set, in a tiebreaker [sic]?
		60. Also after winning last year was it important for to you protect the points by coming here, too?
		61. Also happy almost-birthday, correct?
		62. Also, the story  I've read it everywhere  when you were four years old walking through your parents' bedroom. Am I right?
		63. For the consistency of the performance throughout, have you ever played a better match here, do you think?
		64. You have a very good relationship with Justin, but how easy do you find it to focus on knocking this guy out of Wimbledon?
		65. Considering your success earlier in your career here on this court, are you surprised it's been this long since you've won?
		66. Were you nervous going into this match against such a top player? How big is this win for you, for your career?
		67. What does a week like this do for you as far as the tournaments that you were planning to play? You're going to go from 92 to 32 no matter what happens. Were there challengers you were planing to play that you will pull out of now and try to enter bigger events in the fall?

		69. How do you explain it?
		70. How do you explain the great recent form you've been, Auckland to here?
		71. As you said, Serbia is a small country, but you have three players in the top 25. The three of you were playing today in Montral. How do you explain Serbia's success?
		72. How do you explain that?
		73. You've won every single first set here 6-Love. How do you explain that?

		75. How do you explain that you beat him 11 times in a row? He's a Grand Slam winner.
		76. How do you explain three or four breaks towards the end there?

		78. How do you explain it?

		83. You've been on a roll for a couple of weeks. How do you explain your recent success?

		85. Very strong finish. You won 16 of the last 20 points. How do you explain that?

		87. How do you explain the difference between a couple months ago and how you're playing right now?
		88. You've had a little bit of lackluster season, this hard court season. How do you explain your performance here at the US Open?

And last week, Andy Roddick on the one hand complained that maybe the coverage of tennis in the United States is not that great, but maybe it wasn't so good to have reporting where they say at 4:15 you took a gulp of Gatorade. Do you think that sometimes there's too much in any way, or in your case, or not?
		91. It looks as if we're going to get the top four in the semifinals again. Can you talk a little bit about that, this stranglehold you guys have got on the slams is pretty impressive, isn't it, over the last few years?
		92. Did you need treatment at any stage and what was it?
		93. Did you need an IV drip or any other special treatment after?
		94. Did you need to have a complete game today or are you happy with the one set?
		95. Did you need to take an IV after the match, intravenous feeding?
		96. As Ben said, it had been a while since you had beaten Maria. Did you need a win like this over her to help your confidence at all or turn the rivalry around?
		97. Are you happy the way your form is? If the Australian Open was tomorrow, are you happy with the way things have gone?
		98. I suppose because of the nature of the tournaments they tend to play in, British women tend to kind of fly under the radar in terms of publicity. They might get the results in every once in a while, but this is going to be big headlines, back page, maybe, who knows? Do you like that thought, that it's actually going to be a surprise element and here you are on the back pages rather than just a line...
		99. At what point were they comfortable saying you could go to a coach, you can go to America? A lot of parents won't do that.
		100. It sounds like you've lowered your expectations quite a bit, maybe not just for this tournament, but in general. Is that tough for a former No.1, three-time Grand Slam champion, saying, I might get to the second week, maybe not, and if I don't, that's okay?

	100 sample questions that were assigned type 7 (3006 total questions with this type) :
		1. Roger had a tough match yesterday against Andreev. Did that surprise you about how tough that match was? Do you prefer to have these tough matches initially so you get challenged and build on that momentum?
		2. How long does it take you to fully adjust from the clay to the grass? How far in the tournament do you think it takes you to get to your peak on grass?
		3. How can you comment on the fact that this tournament in Monte-Carlo in the quarterfinals will play 7 of the top 10 players from the ATP list, if I'm not mistaken?
		4. Can you play loose and free, or is your game not at the point yet where you feel like, I've got all my shots now?
		5. Another way of asking that, coming out of that match, what did you learn from tonight? You were down most of the match and kept fighting back. What do you take away from that, and how will that help you in the upcoming matches?
		6. What is your secret? How can you play so well for such a long time?
		7. What did Nick bring? What's his special ability that he brings to player development?
		8. Another question: There so many goals in the end of the season with the Davis Cup, Masters, et cetera, so how can you keep going? How can you meet those goals?
		9. Given the previous years, did you book your hotel just for a couple of days, or did you go straightaway through the two weeks?
		10. So you mentioned being relaxed. On court from the outside we are under the impression that you're relaxed with these good results. How can you be relaxed? Because you have to manage your emotions and feelings; first quarterfinal in a Grand Slam tournament. We are under the impression that you are used to pressure from the outside.
		11. How can you hurt her tomorrow? She's a very aggressive player, a lot of power.
		12. It's not the same situation, but many times you had Davis Cup, US Open. It's too much, you need more rest, but it's impossible. How can you solve this?
		13. How can you practice that in a training situation?
		14. I want to come back to Bercy. If I am not wrong, you scored only four points in the last set against Davydenko. I supposed it was a very low part of your season. What a difference today. How can you bounce back from that defeat today?
		15. How can you sum up your first week?
		16. That was always going to be about serve, that match. Given that you talked about the improvement in your own serve over the offseason, how do you think that went?
		17. How badly the back injury affected your performance last year, what kind of changes did you make to your routine and preparation?
		18. To end on a lighter note, I guess you're going back to domestic duties with the baby. How handson are you? What surprised you the most with the baby and your new role as a father?
		19. How do the Penn tennis balls play relative to the balls at other tournaments?
		20. Look ahead to tomorrow, Juan Martin, one game against him. How do you play tomorrow night?
		21. This was a marquee match, and yet you guys were on the court with no shot spot. I know he had more of an issue with it than you did. How do you play a match if you know you can't go up to the challenge booth if it doesn't exist on this particular court?
		22. People are focusing on your serve. Can you just talk us through your career? Was that a natural shot for you, or was it something you worked particularly hard on?
		23. You got a ticket for James tomorrow night? What about Melbourne?
		24. It's the first time you played this guy, right? How long does it take you to usually figure this guy out, or did you ever figure him out?
		25. So what was the difference today? Was it perhaps that you played better than in the Hopman Cup match or was Alize not quite as strong? How do you see it?
		26. You said obviously she's the favorite two days ago because she had won all these matches and sets in a row. When you went out there, did you definitely believe you could win, and did you know what you could do against her?
		27. When you decided to hire Carlos, did you genuinely believe that you would be here, or did it take time to believe it actually?
		28. Does an easy match like this, in a sense, does did make it more difficult to play your next match?
		29. A strange match in some respects. You realized that Gilles' condition wasn't great. How did you approach it?
		30. Can you just talk a little bit about the match today? It looked a lot tougher than the match against Kevin last year here?
		31. How many times did you expect her to retire, I guess, today? Because there were a few times where she sort of paused, and it looked like maybe she was about to. Did you keep thinking it was about to stop?
		32. It was important for the umpire to make a quick decision? So either play or go off. Do you need a quick decision?
		33. Before one of you is serving, is it your style to confer with each other or let it flow?
		34. Before you saw the draw, I mean, coming into this tournament, you know, second week, is that something you were even thinking about or would you have been happy with a couple of match wins?
		35. Before you kind of made the final decision, did you consult with the members of your team and say to them, Look, this is the kind of direction I think I'm heading, and are you comfortable or how do you feel about that?
		36. How do you change that to try to get it in the first half dozen games?
		37. How do you change your game when it's slower?
		38. How if any, being now the topranked American in the tournament now, have any effect on you, if any?
		39. Just talk a little bit about regrouping at the beginning of the third physically and mentally?
		40. I think you've said before that when Serena is playing her best, she maybe is the one player that no one can beat. So when you found out she was out of the draw yesterday, I guess it opened it up pretty much for everyone, no?
		41. Bit of an up-and-down match there? Second set got away from you?
		42. What's it going to mean to you to represent Australia in Fed Cup?
		43. What did you learn from playing her in Miami this year?  Anything new?
		44. And you don't feel like your win got short-changed at all because of the way she lost?
		45. Why did you need the support when you haven't in the past?
		46. So where does beating Martina here on center court, where does that rank in your career?  Is that your biggest win, would you say or no?
		47. How did you deal with that? What was the challenge like for you?
		48. What did you learn from Andre?

		60. Before this match Feliciano had a 6-1 hard court head-to-head advantage on you. What did you learn from the previous battles that attributed to this victory?

		67. You got a cold?
		68. You got a shot at the quallies at the US Open?
		69. Obviously, you'd be surprised at how easy the last two sets were. You got any understanding why that would be?
		70. You got a little taste of the reporting side?
		71. Got pretty angry when they didn't get into the championship game?
		72. You got on top of her early, which I guess is somewhat important, got up 30, and then she had a hard time pushing you at all, yes?
		73. Got to be pretty happy, but also pretty tough to play a guy who is so unbelievably up and down and kind of whacky?
		74. We saw you engage in psychological warfare, talking about the pressure on him, how long it's been, using 150,000 years out on court. Was it so much sweeter beating Andy because he has a very good record against you and has got under your skin in the past?
