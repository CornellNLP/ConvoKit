		8. What do you think will be the biggest key to sustain this success into next year?
		9. You know what it's like to hold up a trophy from the juniors. What do you think it would be like to hold the real one?
		10. What do you think would be the single largest reason for you to win the match today?
		11. You seen her play obviously.  What do you think the key will be to beat her?
		12. You said your type of game was different from Wozniacki's. What do you think the key of the match against Wozniacki will be?
		13. What do you think it will be like facing Taylor if you face her next?
		14. What do you think the threat for Serena would be to Andy?
		15. What do you think would be so difficult about facing each of those guys? Break it down.
		16. It's a repeat of last year's final. What similarities and differences do you think might be out there on Monday versus last year?
		17. What do you think that would be like, mixed doubles in the Olympics?
		18. You had a wrist injury a few years ago. You know what it's like to come back from that. What do you think it will be like for Laura coming back after such a long absence?
		19. If you do face Williams, what do you think would be the key to that match?
		20. One of the players who really loves you is Serena Williams. It seemed like last year a lot of times when you won a tournament, she would win a tournament. After many years of not playing Indian Wells, she's in the entry list for Indian Wells this year. What are your thoughts on that, and do you think it would be good for the game for our greatest woman player to come into the tournament at Indian Wells?
		21. I know for Wimbledon without the Williams sister is like strawberries without cream. What do you think if there were no Williams sisters anymore at Wimbledon? Do you think it would be less of an exciting place?
		22. You are No.1 in the world. Nobody wants to take anything out of you being No.1. This was in a year where there were four different winners. Murray was the only one who won also Olympic Games. Do you think if he would win, for the public opinion, even if you will be No.1 for the ATP computer, he could be the No.1 in the public opinion image, as it happens for Serena Williams, that she is No.3 in the world but everyone thinks she's the best? What do you think?
		23. So if you had to pick a height, what do you think would be the best out there?
		24. Obviously you had your time as world No.1. Towards the end of that there must be a period where somebody chips an odd result against you here or there. That's happened to Federer this year. Will that make an impact on him, do you think?
		25. Will that bring you a bit of luck, do you think?
		26. What are your thoughts on the idea of a timer for the time in between points? Do you think that could possibly be something that would be embraced by the players and be helpful?
		27. About Gasquet, do you think he will be a permanent top 5, top 10 player in the next few years?
		28. Yesterday the last match of the day on center court started at 1:12 a.m. What do you think about those late starts? Do you think there should be a rule to prevent that?
		29. You're very good off both wings; played good defense. What do you think you're going to need to keep building on this and be able to compete at this level on a regular basis?
		30. Sam, sorry. I guess I made an assumption. Anyway, my point being, though, do you ever think about, as a mother, how wonderful it would be to -- is that a dream and a motivation of yours?
		31. You've already said that in Madrid you're not at 100%. Talking about Rome, do you think you'll be in the highest level there in order to go to Roland Garros in your best shape? Do you think that after Madrid you're going to go to Rome in your best shape?
		32. You have Julia Goerges next. You have never played her. Will you think to Zheng Jie to find out?
		33. With your win today, what would you think would be the first thing that you practice on when you practice later today or tomorrow? What do you think you do that you would need to practice on? What would be the first thing that you would need to practice on?
		34. Huge, can it be very huge? How big of an achievement do you think it could be?
		35. You brought up the point that you seem uncertain concerning whether you will continue in this tournament. As you sit up there at the moment, what do you think it will be? Do you think you'll be able to get out there or do you think this is it?
		36. It was such a high hurdle for you. Do you think you'll enjoy the actual tournament more than you have in the past? How do you think it will be different?
		37. Yet another final for you here in London. Is it fair to say you're getting used to this surface? Are you going to be 100% for tomorrow? Can you think about the final you played with Roger a few years back to now?
		38. What do you think you need to be like when you play her?  Keep it in check or just be yourself?
		39. A lot of the game is the mental side of the game. Players before they play Nadal say, I have nothing to lose. You don't have that attitude. You say you want to win. If you approach him with that steely mentality, do you think it may intimidate him?
		40. You said you didn't know that the other matches had stopped when you came off. If it's deemed too hot to play, do you think matches should stop then rather than having to continue for the rest of the set?
		41. If Andy Murray doesn't win Wimbledon, do you think the crowd here would like you to win it more than anybody else now?
		42. If you hadn't had the 41 matches in a row going into the semifinal with Roger at the French, do you think you would have had more chance to win that match?
		43. If he had won the point, how different do you think things might have been?
		44. If you win it, do you think they'll get the right name on the trophy?
		45. If you play this well again on Sunday night, do you think either Federer or Djokovic can beat you?
		46. You've continued to improve right along.  If you keep it up at this rate, do you think you can go all the way?
		47. If I could ask, what are your thoughts about Serena, and do you think her absence hurts the game?
		48. So your racquets were in trouble today; you were in trouble. If the roof didn't close, do you think you would have lost the match?
		49. If you win this tournament, will you sort of silence those people who began to doubt you a bit after your recent setbacks and problems, or do you think you've done that already?
		50. If you had to play all those sets in the wind yesterday, do you think the outcome might have been different?
		51. If you play her, who do you think Max will root for?
		52. If this match does go to Monday  we'll see  would you watch it or go along or send Bob along to scout it or how would you do it?
		53. If being out with injury recently, has that renewed your enthusiasm for the game?  If so, if you stay healthy, will we see Serena full time on the tour this year?
		54. What do you think about the clay court? It will be a three-player battle, with Novak you and Roger, or do you think other players can fight also?
		55. If it is Andy Murray in the next game, do you think the Wimbledon crowd will be a difficult thing to overcome?
		56. What are your expectations for Rome and Paris after this impressive run? Do you think you can take the form even if the conditions are a bit different?
		57. How do you think about getting to the final four, the semis? Do you think you have a good chance to get there? You've beaten Lleyton Hewitt here before. Do you think he's still got the ability to think that he can get to the final four, perhaps the final?
		58. Will we see you back next year in Sydney at the Medibank International?
		59. Will we see you out playing soccer sometime?
		60. I remember that you used to dance for celebration after the match. You didn't dance after beating Victoria and today. Will we see you dance next match?
		61. Will we see you trying a between-the-leg shot anytime soon?
		62. So if you are in the second week here, what do you think that will be like for you?
		63. Andy hasn't dropped a set yet in this tournament. If you can be the first person to take a set off him, do you think that will put him under the kind of pressure he hasn't experienced for a while?
		64. If you reach the final, do you think it will be a phone conversation between you and Rafa?
		65. If you had not gone gluten free do you think you'd be able to do what you're doing?
		66. They're doing away with one of the biggest traditions of Wimbledon, wearing all white for the Olympics. Are you going to go wild or do you think it will be weird?
		67. What do you think she'll make of your comments about her outfit? Will you seek her out afterwards?
		68. Do you plan to watch the Roddick match tonight? If Roddick does win tonight, what are your thoughts on potentially facing him next round?
		69. What is your relationship with Maria Sharapova, and what do you think the potential might be for a rivalry on the court between the two of you?
		70. Stacey yesterday spoke a little bit about the idea of the women's tournament and the men's year-ender all taking place at the same time possibly in the future. What would you think about that? Would you support that? Or do you think the women should stay separate?
		71. Maybe after really long points or if it is very hot, do you think it would be appropriate to make a little more time?
		72. What do you think can take you to the next level?  You played in the Sydney final, lost to Justine.  You're world No.2.  What is it going to take for you to step up and start winning those kinds of matches, perhaps be No.1?
		73. Irrespective of how long you carry on, do you think it will always be Henman Hill?
		74. The sort of younger players, a group of players who have yet to properly emerge, how far away do you think they might be from being able to challenge the likes of you?
		75. Looking ahead, do you think Wimbledon will be your best chance again as a slam this year?
		76. Congratulations for another Masters 1000 for your career. I wanted to ask you about Nishikori. Seeing how he played the first set and the rest of the tournament and Barcelona, too, do you think that that potentially he can be No.1 of the world?
		77. I just want to ask you in terms of your forehand going off sometimes in terms of timing, how much do you think the game needs to get better for you this week and next so you can be content?
		78. Obviously there is not a lot of talk in the last five, six years about the sort of Golden Age of tennis that people consider it to be now with you and Rafa and Roger. Having played Kei and about to play Milos, do you think these guys will be able to keep up that level, or will it be just sort of a different generation, different era, and people will have to accept in the next few years?
		79. Considering all the amount of time you already spent on court this year, do you think, whatever the result you achieve here, the period between tomorrow or Sunday, within your next tournament, will be a crucial one regarding your objectives at the French Open?
		80. You've struggled this year to win back-to-back matches. Do you think it could be different this week in Shanghai? Obviously you hope it will, but do you think it could be different?

		87. The next opponent will be Jankovic.  What kind of opponent do you think she will be?
		88. What sort of outfit do you think would be suitable to wear on Thursday then?
		89. You have been here in America, I don't know, 10 days or so, and you come here all the time. What do you like best about American culture, American life? Just reflect on that. Do you think your country could learn anything from what we do?
		90. What do you foresee now? Do you think you won't repeat that score?
		91. Do you think you can win the tournament here? Do you think you can be Wimbledon champion?
		92. If you play against Nadal tomorrow for the final, what do you think about it?  Do you think -- are you sure he's going to play against you this final again, or you think it's more you --
		93. I noticed your first-serve percentage is just 53%, even lower than Chardy's 68%. What do you think about that? Is it normal? If not, what's the reason?
		94. Here's something else you probably never thought about.  Everybody said there's nobody good in the bottom.  Nobody any good down there after Sharapova lost.  What do you think of that, to be among the bottom feeders?
