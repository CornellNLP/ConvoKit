	100 sample questions that were assigned type 0 (16512 total questions with this type) :
		1. While friends of the United States of America and Israel will greatly regret the supply of weapons to the brutal and violent regime of Ayatollah Khomeini , will my right hon and learned Friend assure us that our hands are clean ? What are the allegedly non - lethal weapons that we are allowed to supply ?
		2. Is the Minister aware that the Construction Industry Training Board and the National Construction college in my constituency have trained a record number of apprentices over the last year ? Is he also aware that the current governing statute is not fit for purpose and needs to be updated so that it can enter into joint ventures with both the public and private sectors , training even more apprentices ? Will he look at this important reform and have it on the agenda when he meets the chief executive officer , the chairman and hopefully me as well ?
		3. I am grateful to my hon Friend for that reply . Does he agree that the longer - term beef production cycle means that there has also to be commensurate longer - term confidence in the United Kingdom beef producing sector ? Is he aware that his and his right hon Friend 's robust defence of the scheme is welcome , in that it does lead and will lead to the consumption of beef ? Can he seek to sustain it on a longer - term basis instead of a year - by - year negotiation basis ?
		4. One key to implementing the working time directive fully will be to ensure that people are fully aware of their entitlements . What steps is my right hon Friend taking to see that people know what the directive entitles them to ? In view of his earlier remarks , will he reassure my constituents that they will not be forced to spend their annual leave in the company of the hon Member for Southend , West ( Mr. Amess ) ?
		5. May I ask the Minister a question of which I have given him notice ? Do Ministers believe Sir Leon Brittan when he asserts that Mr. Powell approved the leaking of legal advice to the Government ? Will Ministers do anything about an article in yesterday 's Evening Standard , which said " Leon pays Westland debts " and in which it was asserted that there was some kind of a pay - off for—
		6. Does the hon and learned Gentleman accept that his predecessor understood that the law might need strengthening ? Is it not a matter of concern to him , and to the Conservative Government , that it appears from the case that the position regarding imported machinery is significantly lower and is entirely outside the Health and Safety at Work etc . Act 1974 , and may be outside the absolute provisions in section 14 of the Factories Act 1961 ? Why should this country tolerate lower standards for imported machinery than for our own machinery ? In this respect , why can we not adhere to the standards of other EEC countries , which would not tolerate these lower standards ?
		7. Does the Secretary of State agree that among those unemployed school leavers are a large number who have never had the opportunity of training ? Does he also agree that they may reach the age of 19 , and therefore be too old , before the new training initiative comes into force ? Has he any proposals to help those young people , especially the physically handicapped who constitute the largest proportion of those unemployed ?
		8. Does my right hon Friend agree that it is ridiculous to have so many research assistants working in the House ? Is he aware that 102 hon Members have two or more research assistants , one hon Member has eight research assistants , two have nine , nine have four , three have five and four have six ? Should we not try to tie the number down so that . Members have no more than one research assistant and that research assistants on the books are paid ?
		9. Is my right hon Friend aware of the rally being held here in Westminster tomorrow by qualified herbalists who are coming to lobby for statutory regulation , which my right hon Friend is obliged to provide under European law ? When will he do that , please ?
		10. Before my right hon Friend sees the TUC , will she look at the speech made last weekend by the Leader of the Opposition in which he said that it would be quite wrong for the trade union movement of this country to precipitate politically motivated strikes in order to bring down this Government ? Is she aware that that view has the overwhelming support of hon Members of this House and will she ensure that a copy of that speech is placed in the Library of the House of Commons so that in the coming months when the situation may be rather different , all hon Members , including the Leader of the Opposition may refresh their memories on the details of the speech ?
		11. I welcome my hon Friend 's positive response to discussions with British Waterways . As he knows , the benefits that it delivers in terms of education , regeneration , transport and sport , among other things , are the responsibility of many Departments other than his own . In his discussions with ministerial colleagues , particularly those in the Treasury , will he redouble his efforts to ensure the delivery of a secure and sustainable funding regime for British Waterways that secures the future of these valuable national assets ?
		12. Will the Minister encourage his colleagues to stop gloating when the German , French or Spanish economies get into any trouble and remember that they are our major customers for manufacturing products and that when they start getting into trouble , it is not long before we follow them into recession ? Will he remember that the lead element needed to reactivate British manufacturing is top - quality managers ? Are the actions of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Education and Employment encouraging that development by cutting university education , university postgraduate education and business schools ? Is that the right way to tackle our manufacturing dilemmas ?
		13. I am sure that the Secretary of State agrees that a key component of the bid is the decision to site the yachting events at Weymouth and Portland harbour . It is a natural harbour and the obvious location . However , does she share my concern that Powergen has submitted planning applications to build a wind farm on the breakwater of Portland harbour ? That will obviously have a detrimental effect on sailing and the Olympic bid . Does she agree that unless the whole country—including business—gets behind the bid , there will be no economic benefit ?
		14. When my hon Friend responds to representations from local authorities , will she resist the pressures to support ring fencing of budgets ? Does she agree that hon Members who support wholesale ring fencing of local government budgets are in favour of destroying local government as we know it ?
		15. Is my hon Friend aware that hon Members representing English seats recently received from the Department of Education and Science a letter drawing to our attention the fact that the Government intend to have a microprocessor in every secondary school in the United Kingdom , and giving details of schemes that the Government have to promote this end ? Will he confirm that those details have also been sent to hon Members representing Welsh constituencies ? If not , will he look into the matter and ensure that they are sent ?
		16. Will the Minister confirm that most of the concerns that hon Members have put to him in the communications that he has received refer to the very point raised by the hon Member for Newry and Armagh ( Mr. Mallon ) ? In the light of that , will he look at the question put to him and his answer because he is not quite right in what he said ? Will he and the Northern Ireland Office also consider that this question highlights a real problem , in that the only remedy would appear to lie at United Kingdom level , yet we find ourselves having to ask the question of a Minister of the Northern Ireland Office , when it should go to the relevant Minister of the Department of Social Security in the United Kingdom ?
		17. Literally thousands of EU nationals play an indispensable role in fish processing and agriculture businesses in my constituency , yet this week the Government have failed to give any reassurance that these people will be allowed to live and work here post - Brexit . Will the Secretary of State and her Ministers make every effort to use all their influence with the Home Secretary to provide some certainty at an early stage for these people and these businesses ?
		18. Is the right hon Gentleman aware of the danger of the spread of this disease to our own plants by lorries that have carried infected blooms subsequently visiting nurseries owned by our growers ? In those circumstances , why is he taking a risk by allowing imports to continue ? We know that under the present system blooms infected with white rust are able to enter this country .
		19. I thank my right hon Friend for that reply . Is he aware that this summer 's remarks by the Home Secretary regarding the behaviour of some travellers were met with a chorus of approval in my constituency , especially in the communities of Beccles and Bungay , where a group of travellers spent four weeks in one public open space ? Just when the council was about to complete the civil procedures , they moved and spent another four weeks on a school playing field , leaving piles of rubbish and filth on both sites . Does my right hon Friend accept that the public want illegal encampments to be dispersed quickly , and that the civil remedy is not effective in that respect ? Will he issue even stronger guidance to the police to ensure that they use all available legislation to disperse illegal encampments because Suffolk police have said to me that their policy is hardly to use such powers ?
		20. Does the Minister accept that in Bradford the combination of cutting expenditure and creeping privatisation is creating widespread concern among those who depend upon the National Health Service for their health care ? Will he nail the rumour that he has it in mind to appoint councillor Eric Pickles as the chair of Bradford district health authority ? His appointment would have a devastating effect upon the morale of those who serve in the Health Service in Bradford and would be most unwelcome to the citizens of that city who depend on the service for their health care .
		21. Does the Chancellor accept that , even with this morning 's announcement from Germany , our interest rates are still very substantially above those elsewhere in Europe ? Will the Government finally wake up to the fact that their policy of exclusive reliance on high interest rates for demand management has succeeded in plunging this country into recession , starving industry of investment funds and ensuring that our economic performance has been far worse than Germany 's ?
		22. On 22 June 2004 , I raised in an Adjournment debate the case of my constituent James Bishop , who was killed by a Chinese national , Mr. Yin . Due to lack of co - ordination at IND , he was removed before being prosecuted fully for the offence . I appreciate that the Home Secretary will not have the answer today , but will he write to me to confirm that the promises made during that debate have been fulfilled and that the co - ordination of such cases has been improved ?
		23. Does the Prime Minister agree that , while it must be right for both parents to contribute properly to the maintenance of their children , the Child Support Agency is causing widespread anxiety and dismay by imposing a rigid and inflexible financial formula that often ignores the realities of people 's lives ? Will he institute an immediate review of the operation of the Child Support Act 1991 ?
		24. Could my right hon Friend extend market testing to ensure that when civil service jobs are about to be moved from one constituency to another area , the civil servants who are doing those jobs are given the opportunity to bid for them under private management ?
		25. As the Minister is so anxious to bring the strike to an end , why does he not advise the Cabinet to instruct the National Coal Board to go back to the negotiating table and start negotiating on the true facts about the viability of pits instead of the nonsense that it has talked so far ? Is he aware of the report that I have in my hand , and which is marked " Confidential " ? In it , five leading accountants , including two professors of accountancy , show quite clearly that the facts and figures that the NCB has used so far are utter nonsense ? Will he go back to the negotiating table on that basis ? [ Interruption . ]
		26. For each pound that the public sector has lent to Northern Rock , how much specific security has the Bank of England taken for the taxpayer ?
		27. I thank the Secretary of State for that reply . Does he agree , however , that it is important that developed countries , including our European counterparts , show sensitivity to the developing world as regards climate change implications from the vantage point of the developed world ? Will he therefore stress to them his personal support - and , I hope , that of the Government more widely - for the 10:10 campaign , which will feature in my colleagues ' Liberal Democrat - led debate later today ?
		28. Why does the White Paper not specify individual areas where shortfall will occur , instead of giving a general global estimate ? How does the right hon and learned Gentleman presume that local authorities will fall short by specific amounts when he can not have any idea whether they will underspend or overspend ?
		29. Does the hon Gentleman agree that co - operation between the North and the South in industrial relations or any other economic matter can only be beneficial to both communities ? That does not necessarily entail restricting co - operation with Great Britain . Will he propose to the Government of the Republic the establishment of a North - South economic development council ?
		30. Before the Secretary of State decided to put Railtrack into administration , did he ask the company for its expected interim results ?
		31. Research from the Institution of Engineering and Technology shows that science , technology , engineering and maths - based toys are three times more likely to be targeted at boys than at girls . I should declare an interest as a chartered engineer in the IET. Will the Secretary of State declare her support for the Let Toys Be Toys campaign , which aims to give girls and boys , in the run - up to Christmas , a real choice about the kinds of toys they can enjoy and the careers they can have ?
		32. May I declare my interest , and ask the Minister whether he is satisfied with the progress being made by CCGs in the provision of diabetes prevention work ?
		33. Will the Minister also confirm that the helicopters took the film that enabled the courts to identify and convict the persons involved in the murder of the two army corporals , including Messrs. Kane , Kelly and Timmons , are a particularly valuable asset to the security forces ? Will the Minister recommend to the Secretary of State that when he replies to the erroneous and misleading letter that he received from the hon Member for Kingston upon Hull , North ( Mr. McNamara ) , he should explain carefully the distinctions , in law and in fact , which the courts drew carefully and accurately in that case ?
		34. The Minister will know that large families are likely to produce the most household waste , and are least likely to be able to afford additional charges . Already , three out of four fly - tips are household waste , and this policy is likely to make that problem worse . Will he join me in congratulating the London borough of Havering , which has decided not to make any additional charges for waste collection , and will he recommend its decision to other local authorities ?
		35. Will my right hon Friend confirm that since privatisation in 1986 , domestic gas prices have fallen in real terms , taking account of the extension of VAT , by 16.5 per cent . ? Will he contrast that with the position in the late 1970s under the Labour Government , when the prices of all utilities rose tremendously under very high inflation and interest rates ?
		36. Does my right hon Friend acknowledge that this Michaelmas the Treasury will be receiving around £ 1.5 billion from the sale of the armed forces married quarters estate ? What excuse is there for the Chancellor to delay the essential announcement on the procurement orders which we all expected before the House rose for the summer recess ? He can not have it both ways . First , does my right hon Friend acknowledge that we have the best armed forces in the world ? Secondly , does he agree with our Secretary of State for Defence that they should also be the best equipped ?
		37. Has my right hon Friend met a single individual who can justify Scottish shop workers having fewer rights than shop workers throughout the rest of the United Kingdom ? Does she agree with the statement made by my right hon Friend the Prime Minister , who said : " we should fully protect the rights of those who work on Sundays in order that we may shop then . . . employee protection must go hand in hand with the freedom to shop."—[ Official Report , 29 November 1993 ; Vol . 233 , c. 822 . ] ?
		38. Will my right hon Friend look into private finance as it affects non - clinical services ? My local hospital in Wansbeck is on the verge of a deal , but those working in non - clinical services are worried about their jobs , conditions and wages . Will those services be included in the so - called sell - off ?
		39. Applications for admission may be influenced by the student loan leaflet which the Department of Education published before the Report stage of the Education ( Student Loans ) Bill in this House . As the Bill is currently in the other place and amendments may be agreed to there , will the leaflet be pulped or is it assumed that the Bill will be forced through by a three - line Whip in this House ?
		40. Mr. Speaker , the university of Essex is proud of you . Earlier this month , the Conservatives were humiliated in the local elections in Colchester . Will the Prime Minister discuss with his Secretary of State for Children , Schools and Families why Essex county council is ignoring what the Secretary of State promised in the House in May last year , and is proceeding to close two secondary schools , against the democratic wish of the people of my constituency ?
		41. When the servicemen and women of other nations are exposed to injury , they are given the best possible medical treatment , often in military hospitals , whereas ours are handed over to the national health service . Does the Prime Minister recognise that moving Defence Medical Services to Birmingham has not worked and will not work in future ? Will he yield to overwhelming pressure indicating that our only military hospital , the Haslar hospital in Gosport , should be retained ?
		42. Would the hon Gentleman use his good offices to support me and others who want to press the Government to bring the matter before the House of Commons on a free vote ? I recall lobbying the then Home Secretary James Callaghan in the late 1960s to lower the voting age to 18 , and he decided then that it was a matter for the House of Commons as a whole and for individual Members to decide . Does the hon Gentleman not think that , now the Electoral Commission has examined it , this matter should come before the House , so that each and every one of us can decide whether to vote for or against it ? I will vote for it .
		43. Will the Minister ensure , first , that the subsidy , small and inadequate as it is , will not become a subsidy for failure , which would penalise ports such as Grimsby , which have done their best to fight back ? Secondly , will he recognise the pressing need for aid to the processing industry , which is having to carry a heavy burden of stocks to level out the fluctuations of local landings ? Is he aware that if that burden continues there is a danger of redundancies in the fish processing industry and , therefore , a case for aid ?
		44. Can the Minister assure the House that he is making continuing and continual assessments of the performance gain of pupils who attend so - called summer schools compared with those who do not ? While it gives me no joy to say it , will he confirm that the rate of improvement in standards of literacy and numeracy overall in the past three years has been less than it was in the equivalent three - year period before that ?
		45. Will the Minister be accompanied to Beijing by the Sports Ministers of the devolved Parliaments and Assemblies of the United Kingdom ? If so , will she discuss with the Minister from Northern Ireland its prospects of getting some of the Olympic games when the London Olympics take place ? What is in it for Northern Ireland ?
		46. As one of the aims of the social security review is to simplify the system , why will the Prime Minister not establish a legal minimum wage and retain wages councils rather than subsidise employers through the new family credit scheme ?
		47. I , too , congratulate the Government on teach first as part of their success in recruiting more teachers . May I ask the Minister , when considering the roll - out and extension of teach first , not to forget our rural areas , including the south - west region ?
		48. In view of the relatively rosy picture of the UK economy that the right hon Gentleman has painted , will he go into some detail as to why he believes that the manufacturing sector , compared with others , is doing so badly ?
		49. Conservative Members are enthusiastic supporters of developing the work - life balance , as I told the general secretary of the TUC when I met him recently , but unlike the right hon Lady we recognise that it has to be paid for . Does she not understand that the plethora of directives , consultations and burdens under which British business is groaning today will be paid for in jobs , time and competitiveness ?
		50. I am encouraged by what my right hon Friend the Secretary of State has said about feed - in tariffs . Will he confirm that , if feed - in tariffs are not sufficiently high to encourage community - owned , small - scale green power schemes , they will not succeed in that respect ? In the light of that , will he redouble his efforts to find a space in his diary to visit the Torrs hydropower scheme in New Mills , the country 's first 70 kW community - owned hydropower scheme ?
		51. Although the Government have an excellent record on aircraft noise , including the decision to refuse planning permission for a fifth terminal at Heathrow in the 1980s , and the removal of the Heathrow to Gatwick helicopter link , is my hon Friend aware that hundreds of thousands of people living around Heathrow , where there are 1,000 flights a day , find aircraft noise a curse and a pestilence which spoils their enjoyment of their homes ? Apart from emergencies , should not night flights be banned altogether ?
		52. I thank the Minister of State for that broad answer , but will he be a little more specific ? In view of anxieties about the excessive domination of so - called American culture , should not the Government promote the virtues of the age of enlightenment , the renaissance , and 18th and 19th century romanticism rather than the present - day xenophobia of spokesmen who reside in Billericay and Southend ?
		53. May I tell the Prime Minister that I have received more than 1,000 letters from my constituents—parents , teachers and governors—complaining about the unfair funding settlement for schools in the county , and that the settlement has become worse under this Government ? May I also point out to him that every child in every school in his constituency receives £ 200 more , and that every child in every school in a Birmingham constituency receives £ 500 more , than every child in my constituency and in Worcestershire ? Those sums add hundreds of thousands of pounds to a school 's budget . Finally , may I also ask that rather than giving me the pat answers that misrepresent the Conservative party 's point of view on education , he treat the question seriously and make urgent representations to the Deputy Prime Minister , so that education , education , education really means something for children in Worcestershire ?
		54. Can not the hon Gentleman recommend to the Church Commissioners a realistic increase in the stipend of the clergy because , in addition to their arduous duties , they must now endure the intellectually sterile and sanctimonious utterances of a mediocre nonentity— namely , the chairman of the Tory party ?
		55. Is the Minister aware that from 30 to 95 per cent . of lower - paid workers receive less than half the national industrial wage ? Is that not a clear sign of the need to strengthen wages councils rather than weaken them ?
		56. Sadly , Winnie the pig has left Parliament square and the fount of all our knowledge and wisdom on the subject has gone . Before the pig went , a question was raised with me about research and development in the industry , and the fact that the Minister 's package of help measures does not appear to include anything to assist further improvements in the way in which the British industry operates . Has he any positive proposals to put to the House on that matter today ?
		57. Has the Secretary of State heard or read the remarks about articles 2 and 3 of the constitution of the Irish Republic made by a Minister in the Government of the Irish Republic , Mr. Desmond O'Malley ? Did the right hon Gentleman find those words useful ? Would he encourage other members of that Government to reach the same conclusion ? When the Secretary of State next meets that Government , will he take that stand ?
		58. The Minister rightly mentioned the banning of land mines with pride . Could that be extended to cluster bombs ?
		59. I welcome the extension of the aid and recognise the Minister 's stand . However , does he recognise the catastrophic position of many of our glasshouse growers because of the cumulative effect over many years of the Dutch advantage in fuel costs ? Is it possible to make aid available to make up for the years when the disadvantage was greatest ? Is the right hon Gentleman prepared to implement the Select Committee 's recommendations for the industry , as , without them , there will be many bankruptcies in the years ahead ?
		60. Will the Minister take this opportunity to acknowledge the real and growing contribution to rural employment that is made by the game bird and shooting industry , which employs more than 26,000 people ? In the light of the passing of the Hunting Act 2004 , as well as the pro - regulatory views expressed by the Select Committee on Environment , Food and Rural Affairs and by animal welfare groups , will he reaffirm the Government 's commitment to the principle of self - regulation of the game bird and shooting industry ? To what extent has he considered the case for deregulation , particularly of the anachronistic provision for licences to shoot and to sell game ?
		61. May I bring to the Minister ’s attention the excellent work done by Lewisham council in its insulation partnership , which has seen almost 3,000 homes receive cavity wall and loft insulation in the last six months ? Given the difficulties that the Government have experienced in getting the energy companies to meet their household energy efficiency obligations , does he agree that local authorities have a vital role to play in ensuring that as many people as possible can benefit from lower fuel bills ?
		62. I welcome my right hon Friend 's emphasis on the importance of community care . Will he stress the importance of closing the very large Victorian - built mental hospitals , which are almost impossible to modernise ? However devoted the staff , it can not be in the interests of patients for them to remain in such hospitals .
		63. Is it not extremely dishonest of the Minister to draw comparisons with inner - city authorities , which have a high incidence of immigrant children whose first language is not English , when the Government are cutting section 11 funding to assist such pupils ?
		64. I thank the Minister for his reply . Does he agree that mounting evidence of the severe impact of climate change means that any scheme for trading emissions must include secure monitoring and sensible transitional arrangements ? Can he persuade the United States Government in particular to accept the reality of climate change and the need to take very prompt action ?
		65. Enterprise zones in England are an exciting opportunity to grow the private sector , and I hope they will be delivered in my constituency by the Welsh Assembly Government . Will the Secretary of State update the House on what progress is being made in Northern Ireland to deliver such an innovative opportunity ?
		66. That is a pity . Is the Minister aware that the A47 is vital to Norfolk 's economic future , especially given the rapid expansion of Norwich airport and towns such as King 's Lynn in my constituency ? Is he aware that most of the A47 is substandard single carriageway and that many villages in my area , such as Middleton and East Winch , are crying out for bypasses ? Why has the road been downgraded from a route of national importance to one of only regional importance ? Will he reverse that decision ?
		67. I greatly welcome the Government 's proposals on pension reform , which will remove many people from dependency on means - tested benefit . May we be assured that the Government will assist those who will continue to depend on means - tested benefit , both in the shorter and long term , by replacing the many application forms with just one ? Many people applying for income support and benefits—such as council tax benefit and housing benefit—lose out because they do not understand the present complex system .
		68. My hon Friend knows that the by - catch regulations for skate and dogfish , which were rushed through the Fisheries Council last December , are completely unworkable for the under-10 m fleet . I welcome what he said about trying to get those regulations changed , but will he tell the House the likely time scale and what prospects there are of securing change ? While he is thinking about reforming the quota for the under-10 m fleet , will he give special consideration to long - lining , which is an environmentally sustainable form of fishing that needs to be encouraged ? Long - lining involves just one hook and one fish , not great big nets full of dead fish which are then discarded , so can we treat it in a better way to encourage it ? Long - lining is good for the environment , good for fishing and good for jobs .
		69. I inform the House that I have registered an interest , as I attended the Morphou rally just a month ago . In addition to the religious and cultural destruction suffered by orthodox churches in the northern part of Cyprus , is the Minister aware of the desecration of graves in towns such as Morphou by the siting of army bases and the parking of fire tenders on Cypriot graveyards ? What pressure can he bring on the Turkish Government to stop such actions and return those sacred sites to their former use ?
		70. How does the Minister propose to arrest the depressing erosion of incomes of hill and upland farms which are dependent upon the sheep industry ? Will he do three things ? Will he announce his proposals to end the sheepmeat variable premium ? Will he support a private storage scheme to ease the undoubted danger of fluctuations occuring in the market following the ending of the variable premium scheme ? May we have a five - year continuance of the wool guarantee , as wool constitutes some 14 per cent . of the incomes of sheep farmers in the hills and uplands ?
		71. Is the Minister aware that his record in supporting the application of British teams has been despicable this season ? Why should innocent people who have committed no offence see their teams barred because of the antics of a few National Front supporters , who will be judged on their behaviour in Germany this summer ? When will the Minister start backing British teams and praising British crowds for their good behaviour over the last three years ?
		72. I thank my hon Friend for his answer and for responding to the Adjournment debate a few weeks ago on the same topic . Like me , he perceives the value of county farm estates . However , will he continue to examine ways in which we can secure the future of those county farm estates ? They are continually under review , which can sometimes lead to their sale . We must therefore consider solutions such as community land trusts . I hope that my hon Friend and his officials will continue to investigate the matter .
		73. Given that we have a massive trade deficit with the European Union , surely it would be economic suicide for the EU not to agree a free trade deal with us . However , Civitas has calculated that if it did go down that line , British business would have to pay about £ 5 billion a year in tariffs under WTO rules to access the EU market , and EU businesses would have to pay about £ 13 billion in tariffs to access the UK market . Given that , could we not agree to cover all tariffs for British businesses exporting to the EU , so that they do not have to pay anything , and still be quids in ?
		74. When we welcomed my right hon and learned Friend to Leicester recently in the inner area , did he notice the increase in the number of small businesses and the amount of training available , which has given rise to a large increase in jobs ? Does he not think that the time has come for the city council to put its opposition to the Highfields task force on one side and show where its compassion really lies ?
		75. Will the Leader of the House be spending many hours in the coming weeks concentrating on the work of the Committee of Privileges in Room 12 , deciding whether to persecute a Lobby journalist for doing his job rather well ? Would it not be better if the Committee of Privileges devoted its attention to Mr. Paul Foot 's article in the Daily Mirror of Thursday , revealing that there was a treaty bound in red leather , awaiting signature in Lima on Sunday 2 May , and to asking why , instead , the Prime Minister averted her eyes from peace and decided to sink the Belgrano for her own domestic political purposes ?
		76. While recognising the undoubted right of all members of the General Synod to deeply held views for or against the policies of the present Government , would it be helpful if my right hon Friend were to point out to the General Synod that its reputation would be enhanced if its members , when in Synod , devoted more time to matters spiritual than to matter political ?
		77. On behalf of the whole House , we thank all hard - pressed and often low - paid council staff and others who even now are helping those areas of the north so badly affected by the recent flooding . In contrast to the rhetoric about the northern powerhouse , the Office for National Statistics recently reported that the north is falling further behind as a result of under - investment and that it is getting worse . The average Londoner now produces £ 42,000 a year added value , while in the north - east the average is only £ 18,000 . In the place of more cuts , will the Minister now include specific , substantial and urgent northern investment in his local government settlement later this week ?
		78. On the issue of pensioner incomes , does the Chief Secretary recall reading recently about the agreement between the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Prime Minister a numberof years ago to sign up to something called a fairness agenda ? Under what part of the fairness agenda should the Chancellor of the Exchequer , who earns about £ 140,000 per year , pay the same council tax as many poor pensioners on far lower incomes ?
		79. When my hon Friend met the chairman of the Thames water authority , did he discuss the denationalisation of that body ? Is he aware that the board is in favour of such a course of action ? Could he not agree with the chairman of the board on that objective at least ?
		80. I had the great pleasure during the recess of opening the Jobcentre Plus office in Malton in my constituency and I pay tribute to the work of staff there . I want to ask the Secretary of State two questions . First , will he confirm that those offices will be able to give face - to - face interviews , which are needed from time to time by people who find it difficult to understand the benefits to which they are entitled ? They need to see someone rather than be dealt with over the telephone . Secondly , does the Secretary of State agree that the success of the programme in linking at least two Government Departments depends on a partnership between employers—particularly small and medium - sized enterprises , which are the providers of many of the jobs in our constituencies—the Department and , more particularly , training providers ? Will he confirm that private and voluntary sector providers , which have a better success rate at getting people back into work through training , will be encouraged to take part in the process ?
		81. Will the Secretary of State be complimenting the chairman of British Coal on the fact that , unlike the miners , he will receive his golden handshake from his firm as well as his wages , even though it takes two to make a strike ? Will he ask him to publish a list of those employed by NCB ( Enterprise ) Ltd. ? It has been drawn to our attention that two of the people who have obtained real jobs in that company are Colin Clarke , who was a member of the National Working Miners Committee , who recently received his redundancy pay from the Coal Board , and Roy Ottey , who did not support the strike although he was a member of the NUM executive , but who supported MacGregor and the Secretary of State for Energy ? Is it not a question of jobs for the boys who supported MacGregor , the Secretary of State and the Prime Minister , and not for displaced miners ?
		82. There is a cost - of - living crisis in my constituency and throughout the country . Millions of households in England and Wales are experiencing water poverty . Will the Minister support Labour ’s proposal to impose—not just recommend—a duty on water companies to introduce social tariffs to help struggling families to pay their bills ?
		83. Has my hon Friend read disturbing reports about some cavity wall insulation products , which suggest that in the long term they are not entirely safe ? Will he undertake that the Scottish Office will look into the matter before giving grants for cavity wall insulation material which may have a damaging effect on the health of the people who live in the houses ?
		84. Will the Minister explain why the minority Catholic community so widely distrusts the RUC ? Has he done any research into that , and can he give us any reasons why members of the Catholic community do not want to join the RUC ? In fact it is very similar to black people in certain sections— [ Interruption . ] The Minister will notice where the noise is coming from . It is similar , is it not ?
		85. Before the right hon Gentleman next meets the chairman of the BSC , will be ensure that he meets the steel unions , to discuss with them the new strategy for the industry ? Will be also discuss with the chairman the possibility of cheap energy costs , so that we can compete with Europe ?
		86. The Opposition accept that there should be a lifting of the European ban on British beef as soon as possible . We agree with that position as strongly as the Secretary of State does . However , does he recognise that , if the Conservative party continues to treat this issue as part of the battleground of European politics which is tearing that party apart , it will hinder our chances of persuading our European partners of the strength of our case ? The crisis did not start in Brussels . It started as a result of an announcement by the Government on the link between bovine spongiform encephalopathy and Creutzfeldt - Jakob disease . Public reassurance will return only when there is an agreement on the effectiveness of actions to eliminate BSE from our cattle . How can people be reassured on this issue when the arrangement to dispose of the carcases of cattle more than 30 months old has become a shambles all over Britain this week ? The Opposition have taken a constructive attitude because a huge Scottish industry is at stake and thousands of jobs are in peril . Practical steps have to be taken to reassure the public across Europe . If those practical steps are taken , we will support them . At the end of the day , the Government must govern and they will be judged .
		87. I am interested in the Home Secretary 's rhetoric , but the fact remains that Nottinghamshire constabulary has been deeply affected by this decision . Its morale , which is always a matter of great concern to the chief constable , has been seriously dented . May I invite her to come on to the front line , to see exactly what the implications of her callous decision are ?
		88. In his review of open government , will my right hon Friend contemplate considerably reducing the embargo on public records from 30 years ? We should like to scrutinise the records to find out whether , during their negotiations in 1982 , the Conservative Government contemplated handing over the Falkland Islands this year . Some openness on the stewardship of government by the Tories in the past 18 years would be most welcome .
		89. May I return to the question of my hon Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras , South ( Mr. Dobson ) , which the Minister did not even attempt to answer ? Does the hon Gentleman accept that a variety of estimates have been made by various local authority bodies about the net shortfall of houses in 1984 and the shortfall between houses available and families needing houses , in part the result of an increase in family formation ? Do the Government have a figure about how many houses will be needed by the time this Parliament comes to an end ?
		90. I thank my hon Friend the Minister for her kind remarks and for her excellent answer . Will she also praise my local school that deals with autism—Oak Lodge—and tell the House that the care and education of children with autism are very high priorities for the Government ?
		91. In view of the recently established link between the aircraft builders Shorts of Belfast and Embraer of Brazil , will the Government let the new Brazilian Government know that the United Kingdom will encourage such economic co - operation between our countries ?
		92. I am grateful to my right hon and learned Friend for that reply , but in some ways have we gone far enough ? Are not there serious crimes , such as terrorism and drug dealing , where suspects should be required to make a statement about what they were doing at the time of the crime .
		93. The Secretary of State will know that several thousand reservists and territorials will head for Iraq in the next few weeks . In a helpful briefing , the Under - Secretary of State for Defence , the hon Member for Hove ( Mr. Caplin ) , made it clear that the replacement for statutory instrument 1997/309 , which deals with conditions of service out there in Iraq , is ready and drafted , containing many things that the reserve forces want . Will it be tabled before they go ?
		94. Having now received a response from the Prime Minister to my request for a children ’s funeral fund , I was disturbed to be told that the social fund could provide a “ simple and respectful funeral . ” This answer is both insensitive and totally lacks any understanding of my original request . Has the Leader of the House the authority to facilitate a meeting with me and other bereaved mothers , so that we can explain to the Prime Minister exactly what we are asking for ? This request is important to us as parents , many in this House and , judging from my postbag , many people and organisations across the country .
		95. May I invite the Paymaster General to return to the real world for a moment ? Will she confirm that the tax on jobs and pay , which comes into force 38 days from today , will cost a typical family £ 440 a year ? Will she also confirm that , at the same time , massive council tax increases—even greater than the huge rises forecast in the pre - Budget report—will take effect ? Is it any wonder that the Health Secretary recently said that there would be " one hell of a lather about taxes rising " , and that many people would conclude that the Government 's approach " actually . . . is n't working " ? Does the Paymaster General agree with the Health Secretary 's comments ?
		96. Has the Secretary of State consulted the Bosnian Government as to whether they would prefer NATO or the European Union to continue in charge of peacekeeping operations after next spring ? The Bosnian Government may not have spoken publicly because of their financial dependence on the EU , but would it not be infinitely preferable for NATO to be the umbrella organisation in charge of peacekeeping , even if the United States is not involved ?
		97. Do Ministers support European Commission proposals to extend the scope of the working time directive by ending exemptions from it ?
		98. In my constituency , one - third of homes are in the private rented sector . Tenants are often ripped off and forced to move at a month ’s notice , and the average rent for a two - bedroom home is £ 1,200 a month . Will the Prime Minister back my call for a living rent commission to explore ways of bringing rents back into line with the basic cost of living ?
		99. Given the fruitless hard work that the Secretary of State for Wales recently put into the Brecon and Radnor by - election , and as unemployment was one of the main issues at Brecon , what statement will the right hon Gentleman make on the by - election result ? Does he not think that he owes to Wales , now that it has given its verdict on his employment policy , a full statement as to what new steps are to be taken ? Will he merely repeat the old lessons and tell Wales that under this Government it must endure the same sort of unemployment as we have seen in the past few years ? Has the Minister no comment to make on the Brecon and Radnor result ?
		100. When my right hon and learned Friend next meets the British Medical Association , will he suggest that it gives publicity to those figures , which are responsible for the fact that we now have more general practitioners than ever and the average GP patient list is shorter than ever ?

	100 sample questions that were assigned type 1 (17218 total questions with this type) :
		1. When the right hon Gentleman visits the county palatine , will he explain to the people there why he was quite willing to come here in his chauffeur - driven car on Friday to vote down a private Member 's Bill that would have assisted some pensioners ? Since there has been a great deal written about what he did or did not say about Tories with a conscience , does his conduct on Friday demonstrate that he has much of a conscience ?
		2. How many businesses - perhaps the Minister could name them given that there are so few - will do better because of the national insurance cut and will not suffer because of the VAT increase and the cutback in demand , which will be disastrous for businesses in the north - west ?
		3. Despite the distortion of facts by the Secretary of State , can he explain why , in the Ogmore constituency in 1979 , unemployment was 3·7 per cent . and is now 18 per cent . ? In Maesteg , male unemployment is now 24 per cent . , but will escalate to 40 per cent . , as 800 people have been made redundant by the closure of a colliery there . In addition , only last night the Garw colliery closed , which employed 600 miners . That will raise the percentage of unemployment in Ogmore . What positive action will the right hon Gentleman take , despite the comments by the hon Member for Ynys Môon ( Mr. Best ) .
		4. If the Chancellor 's money supply objectives , interest rate policy and exchange rate targets should prove to be inconsistent , which will take priority ? Will he opt for an overvalued exchange rate , still pricing British workers out of jobs , high interest rates at damagingly high levels , or increased deflationary contraction ? Which will it be ?
		5. Does that £ 15 million to which my hon Friend referred relate just to the Church of England ? Would the figure not be larger if it included all churches , which are also part of our heritage and also have to pay VAT on repairs ? The Churches are hard pressed for money . If we want to preserve those parts of our heritage , which also play an important part in our national life , we need to attend to the problem .
		6. When does the Minister envisage Ukraine becoming a member of the European Union ? [ Interruption . ] " Not too soon , " I heard someone say . Has the economic crisis in Ukraine delayed that country 's entry into the European Union ?
		7. The fact that affordability was slipped into the criteria used by NICE by virtue of a statutory instrument amending the Health Act 1999 would mean that NICE , in deciding on treatments such as beta interferon , could be at odds with the Secretary of State , who said on 8 March : I take decisions about affordability."—[Official Report , 8 March 2000 ; Vol . 345 , c. 1022 . ] If NICE agrees that beta interferon is an effective treatment , will the Minister still stand in the way by saying that it is not affordable to the NHS ?
		8. In thanking my right hon Friend for that helpful reply , may I remind him that Jaguar , the first company to be liberated from the group , has just announced vacancies for 700 more men , and that last time he spoke in the House about Land Rover 's future he looked to the prospect of either a trade buyer or privatisation ? Since no trade buyer appears to be in prospect , may we look forward to privatisation ?
		9. As other hon Members have said , this is an important subject . May I press the Minister on regional co - ordination ? Is he planning to speak further to other countries in the region ? How can the UK make sure that all the partners are focused on the very significant challenges ?
		10. Does the Minister realise that the electors whom he is trying to reach with his statements today will treat his remarks about the Labour party 's proposal with disdain because they recall that it is not so long ago that he , other Ministers and Conservative Back Benchers were dismissing the poll tax with equal disdain and saying that it was iniquitous and would never be brought in ? Now they have changed their minds .
		11. As shoplifting is now a national disease affecting people from all walks of life—indeed , it is almost a national pastime—will the Solicitor - General suggest to the Home Secretary that a new working party be set up to finalise proposals about bag parks and to consider , among other things , ways in which retailers should protect their goods on display ?
		12. As this is a record figure , what steps is my right hon Friend taking to publicise it and to show the people of Scotland the success of the Government 's education policy ?
		13. Have the British Government made representations either to the new leader of the Israeli Labour party or Mr. Sharon on the illegal building of the great Israeli wall ? It is illegal from end to end because it is built 6 or 10 km within Palestinian territory , thus confiscating 10 per cent . of the total land .
		14. Is my hon Friend aware that the poultry industry places great importance on the maintenance of the highest possible health standards within the industry , especially with regard to Newcastle disease ? Will she confirm that the Government believe that a policy of eradication is far better than a policy of vaccination ? If perchance the European Court should continue to disregard the veterinary evidence , will the Government develop an adaptation of the Danish system , which will sustain the high health standards in the British poultry industry ?
		15. While visiting an engineering company in Luton this week , I was told yet again that companies are finding it hard to recruit British engineering graduates and are having to take graduates from overseas . Are the universities simply not producing enough engineering graduates , or are graduates going to other jobs and working overseas ?
		16. Are there any lines of communication between the ivory towers of the Treasury and the embattled Departments of Employment and of Trade and Industry , which are faced with increasing unemployment , including a large increase last month that especially affects the north - west , which is dependent on manufacturing industry ? Does the Chancellor of the Exchequer realise that in the complacent world in which he lives , people are unemployed because of the Treasury 's policies ?
		17. In pursuing the idea that Community countries should co - operate over their attitude to China , does the Foreign Secretary believe that his position is somewhat clouded by the fact that the British Government , through the Department of Trade and Industry , are still actively sponsoring trade missions to China ? Does that not undermine what he is trying to achieve ?
		18. We have heard today about the use of food banks , and the right hon Member for East Ham ( Stephen Timms ) mentioned a recent report from the Church of England , the Child Poverty Action Group , Oxfam and the Trussell Trust that highlighted the problems that arise when those who have been sanctioned lose all their benefits , including housing benefit . I understand that the Department for Work and Pensions is working on a fix to prevent housing benefit from being stopped when a claimant is sanctioned , but while that is being worked on , will the Minister consider sanctioning all but , say , 10p of jobseeker ’s allowance or employment and support allowance now so that other benefits are not automatically cancelled and claimants do not need to use a food bank and end up in rent arrears while they are being sanctioned ?
		19. Will the Minister say whether he has any hard evidence whatsoever that Haringey council is abusing its statutory duties with regard to schools or anything else ? If he does not have that evidence , will he institute an inquiry so that the good name of Haringey council can be cleared once and for all ?
		20. Since two thirds of the green levies on people ’s energy bills were established under this Government , why has the Prime Minister been attacking himself ?
		21. Is the Secretary of State aware of the statement that has been put out by his Department that this problem had gone away ? As it clearly has not gone away from the steel industry , the chemical , the textile , and the paper mill industries , will he now call an urgent meeting of all the parties in an effort to resolve the argument ?
		22. What assessment has the Secretary of State made of the cost of administering those tax credits ? Would that money not be better spent on reducing poverty among children in Wales ?
		23. Does the hon and learned Gentleman not recognise the disastrous state of this and other traditional industries in places such as Leicester , where unemployment is at a fearful level ? Does he not regard the trumpeted allegations of an upturn as a pre - election fraud that is being perpetrated against the background of a growing army of unemployed ?
		24. Will the Minister be a little more forthcoming about the provision of Government funds for the purchase of the locomotives to which the hon Member for Christchurch ( Mr. Adley ) referred ? Does he not know how important it is , in an area of such dereliction as the top part of my valley , Blaenavon , that everything possible should be done to stimulate the tourism which the Big Pit attracts ? Would that not provide , for a very small sum , a considerable opportunity to assist in glamourising one of the most beautiful parts of the Eastern valley ?
		25. Will my right hon Friend take this opportunity to clarify the point that nobody is in prison for debt , but , rather , for contempt of court ?
		26. In his good work of trying to create more open government , will the right hon Gentleman consider making the access of hon Members to civil servants ' information simpler so that we do not have to go through the tortuous route of devising questions , which wastes much more of people 's time ? In local government , the right of each councillor to access to officials works well . Would he , in a sensible manner , allow that to happen with civil servants ?
		27. The Secretary of State will recall that for the past couple of years I have been away shadowing different portfolios . I left with the memory in my ears of his predecessors , the right hon Members for Edinburgh , Central ( Mr. Darling ) and for Oxford , East ( Mr. Smith ) , saying that there was no intention to move the CSA system until the thing was working properly , that it would be robust and that until it was robust it would not be introduced for new cases , let alone for existing ones . The House will have noticed that the present Secretary of State is saying exactly the same thing and giving a timetable of spring next year—I wonder why . What will the Secretary of State say to the many thousands of cases—that means people—who are suffering because their assessments have been frozen in the present system ? Are they not reasonable in concluding that this is all talk ? They want a bit of action and accountability .
		28. Is it not the case that the income derived by the Exchequer from the taxation of work place nursery provision is small , whereas the deterrent to women with child care responsibilities is enormous ? Should we not encourage women with children to seek employment rather than deter them ? Can the Financial Secretary assure us that the Chancellor will consider two specific measures in his Budget—first , the removal of taxation from the receipt of work place nursery provision and , secondly , fiscal incentives to employers to provide nurseries ?
		29. The Prime Minister said a few moments ago that the latest CBI forecast was encouraging . As the last six reports from the CBI have been encouraging , what is so different about this one ?
		30. Given the cross - party support , public support and professional support , and because he can save 150,000 lives a year , why on earth will the Secretary of State not put emergency life support skills somewhere in the national curriculum , so that every school leaver is a life - saver ?
		31. What have Ministers learnt from the ongoing saga of Halvergate marshes , which featured so much in the Committee stage of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 ? Have they learnt anything about the management of wetlands ?
		32. Does the Prime Minister still believe , as he told west country farming communities in the midst of the foot and mouth crisis , that supermarkets have those communities in an arm lock ? If he still believes that , does he support yesterday 's call by the Federation of Small Businesses for an investigation into the practices of supermarkets by the Competition Commission ?
		33. Does my right hon Friend agree , without tempting him into any Budget leaks , that millions of families who have been struggling to pay more than 20 tax rises imposed on them by the previous Government will be hoping in this afternoon 's Budget for a cut in the rate of VAT on fuel and for a commitment to reduce , and not raise , tax rates for ordinary working families ?
		34. On that very theme , my right hon Friend will know that one of the key messages in the Stern review is that we must take strong early action to tackle climate change . As others have pointed out , because carbon dioxide lasts for about 100 or so years in the atmosphere , we must take early action to stop its accumulation , not just aim for a lower emission target in the future . Does my right hon Friend agree and does he see the Bill as helping to address that through five - year carbon budgets ?
		35. Does the Under - Secretary agree that housing associations have carried out an extremely useful job in supplementing local authority housing provision ? Therefore , will he assure the House that the high level of resources will continue , at least throughout the lifetime of this Government , until a new Government are elected , who will do the job even better ?
		36. I thank my right hon Friend for that answer , and for the acknowledgement in the coalition agreement of the work of the Holtham commission . Its message was that there was historical underfunding of Wales to the tune of £ 300 million a year ; that was backed up by Lord Barnett himself and a Lords Committee . Does my right hon Friend accept the report 's conclusion that Wales has , historically , been underfunded ? We acknowledge that cuts will be borne right across the UK , and across all its regions and nations , but will he use this opportunity to confirm the Government 's commitment to fair funding across the country ?
		37. Does the Minister share my concern about the funding of charities ? If so , will she urge the Chancellor of the Exchequer not to change advance corporation tax ? Would she like to explain why it would have a negative impact on charities , and undertake to talk to the charities about any such proposals ?
		38. Is it not time that we ended the inequity whereby the full occupational pensions of the few are financed by the contributions of many who have long since left their jobs ? Is it not reasonable that every employee should have the option of a portable pension if he wishes ?
		39. Will the Minister confirm that people with AIDS could receive £ 30 a week before April 1988 for a special diet and nothing afterwards ? Has the Department yet replied to Naomi Wayne , of the Terrence Higgins Trust , about the misuse of Anita MacDonald 's research ? Will she comment on Katie Peck 's research , which showed that a high - protein , high - calorie therapeutic diet for people with symptomatic HIV in London now costs £ 42 a week ? Why should they be left to complain that they are literally dying for want of the help that was available before April 1988 ?
		40. Following the Milly Dowler trial , does the Secretary of State agree that measures need to be taken to protect the families of the victims of crime from intensive questioning in court ? If a footballer can be afforded privacy from the public arena , can not the father of a murdered child ?
		41. Is this not the third year in succession that the rate support grant has been reduced lay the Government , and that now , for the first time , the domestic rate relief is being halved ? Will not the current rate increase for all domestic ratepayers in Wales be higher than the rate of inflation ?
		42. In recent days , the Prime Minister has said that the UN weapons inspectors should be given sufficient time and space to do their work and that they should not be subject to an arbitrary time scale . Despite the significant military build - up in the Gulf , will the Government ensure that the UN process is not short - circuited and that the inspectors get the time that they need to do their job ?
		43. Have my right hon Friend 's thoughts turned to the Common Market and the British contribution to it ? If so , will she consider taking the " empty seat policy " of De Gaulle until our case is recognised ?
		44. Is the Minister aware that hundreds of billions of pounds are being taken away from local authorities by the holdback policy ? Should he not now consider giving local authorities the power to spend some of their own money without so much restriction ? Is the Minister aware that authorities such as Mid - Glamorgan will have to cut essential services such as nursery provision as a direct result of the Government 's holdback policies ? Is it not time for the Government to give serious consideration to helping such authorities , so that they can retain essential and legal responsibilities ?
		45. When this Labour Government look back on their stewardship of agriculture , and at the despair and sense of abandonment among the farming community , will they not appreciate that their initiatives to promote recreation in the countryside will have been achieved beyond their wildest dreams ?
		46. Does my hon Friend not agree now , as some of us tried to point out on Second Reading , that this total ban is having an adverse effect , particularly on the smaller football clubs ? Therefore , will he look again , as quickly as possible , at that problem , specifically in the case of those smaller clubs which have an excellent record of crowd control and non - violence ?
		47. Is the right hon Gentleman aware that even if he takes on board Labour party policy and extends the scheme to two years , that will be no answer to the fact that we are the worst trained nation in the industrial world ? Does he appreciate that we need a revolution in training if we are to face our competitors on a fair and square basis ? Is he aware that it is the quality as well as the quantity of the youth training scheme that we need to increase ? Does the right hon Gentleman realise that if he makes the YTS compulsory at the same time as extending it , he will put a stigma on the scheme which will kill it stone dead for many young people ?
		48. If business confidence has been as greatly boosted by the Budget as the Chancellor believes , why are firms laying off workers , thus producing record unemployment figures ?
		49. If the Minister is not prepared to give general consent so that all private tenants can become home owners , does he accept the principle that those who are living in homes where landlords will not provide inside sanitation should have the right to serve notice on those landlords of their intention to acquire the property and so become home owners and do the improvements themselves ?
		50. The Solicitor - General has said in the past that , unlike what happened in recent cases of official negligence , the data have not actually been lost , but how does she know ? If the CPS did not know it had the disk in the first place , how can it possibly reassure us that the disk was never copied illegitimately , or that something similar did not occur ?
		51. Tomorrow , the Deputy Prime Minister will be visiting my constituency in east London—and he will be exceptionally welcome—to officiate at the groundbreaking ceremony marking the start of the building of Excel , which , when completed , will be the largest exhibition and conference centre in the United Kingdom . Despite such exciting initiatives , 13 of the 20 most deprived wards in the UK are in Greater London , where we have more unemployment than Scotland and Northern Ireland combined . Will my right hon Friend confirm that the Government will continue to support the regeneration of the Thames gateway ? Does he agree that the areas of London for which objective 2 status is sought have an exceptionally strong case ?
		52. So that nurses are not recruited from prohibited developing countries and are properly checked , there are guidelines stating that the NHS should use only recruitment agencies that are on the approved list . However , the case of Mr. Tawanda Machingura , an illegal immigrant from Zimbabwe who recently pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a vulnerable patient while working as a nurse in a local hospital , clearly shows that those guidelines are failing , as he was recruited via an agency that was not on the approved list . I have raised this issue with the Secretary of State for Health , but have not received any indication that any further action will be taken . As a matter of urgency , will the Prime Minister therefore now introduce measures to ensure that the NHS does not recruit illegal immigrants or nurses from prohibited developing countries , to ensure that patients have the security that they deserve and require ?
		53. The United States Congress , by way of that Act , holds to the view that Tibet is an occupied country whose true representatives are the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan Government in exile . It would appear , would it not , that President Bush also has that perception , as he signed that Act on 28 October ? Does the Prime Minister share the belief that Tibet is an occupied country whose true representatives are the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan Government in exile ?
		54. Does the Minister realise that several hundred women in Liverpool have had to be recalled , either for hospital treatment or for further tests , because of errors in analysis ? What assurances can she give women throughout the country that tests of this kind are accurate ? Does she have faith in the present system , or does she believe that these errors can be eliminated in some way or other ?
		55. Despite the prevalence of pancakes in Parliament today , I am pleased to be asking a food - related question . A recent opinion poll performed by Diabetes UK showed that three quarters of British adults think food and drink manufacturers should reduce the amount of saturated fat , salt and sugar in their products . Does the Minister support introducing mandatory targets for industry to reformulate food and drink products to help people to eat more healthily , and will that form part of the Government ’s childhood obesity strategy ?
		56. Does my right hon Friend recall that the Home Office initiated an international conference on drug prevention which resulted in many initiatives and improved the co - operation of the police and customs , not only within the United Kingdom but outside it ? That , in turn , has led to an increase in drug seizures . Will not that welcome development in suppressing that evil trade benefit our residential communities ?
		57. If circumstances arose in which the Advocate - General believed that Scottish Ministers were not taking the actions required by European Union law , would she advise the Secretary of State to use his powers under section 58 of the Scotland Act 1998 to compel Scottish Ministers to take a certain course of action ?
		58. The whole House will be aware of the huge challenge faced by Suffolk police as a result of the horrible events around Ipswich towards the end of last year . I hope that you will permit me , Mr. Speaker , to pay tribute to the tremendous work of Suffolk police in the course of their investigations . Notwithstanding those horrible murders , is my hon Friend aware that between April and December last year , overall crime in Suffolk reduced by a further 3 per cent ? Will he confirm that , under the new neighbourhood policing arrangements , Suffolk can expect substantial increases in the number of community police officers and police community support officers from April to help us reduce crime even further ?
		59. Does the Secretary of State recognise that measures to deal with budgetary problems in the CAP and structural surpluses are quite inappropriate if they remove from those in the hills and uplands their basic economy ? Will he examine the possibility of strengthening measures for the regional development of those sparsely populated areas using agricultural techniques ?
		60. Are not mortgage interest rates at least 1 per cent . too high , and should they not come down next week , and not next month ?
		61. Because more vessels have been laid up during the period since the Government 's temporary aid scheme began , is it not time that the Minister stopped dangling before the fishing industry the prospect of " Eurocash " and gave immediate aid on the same scale as that received by our Continental competitors ?
		62. Does the Secretary of State recognise that although improved investment in British Rail is welcome , his responsibility relates to the whole country ? Will he give particular attention to the electrification of the east coast line between Aberdeen and Edinburgh , especially in view of the need to develop industry and commerce because of the Channel tunnel ?
		63. Does the Minister realise that the people of Greater Manchester have suffered a decline in the frequency of their train and bus services and a decline in safety standards at stations because of the removal of staff , while the only minor improvement has been the restoration of trams in the centre of the town ? If people in Greater Manchester are to enjoy good public transport , that requires substantial investment in at least five or six more lines for the Metrolink .
		64. In his speech today , the Prime Minister talked about the causes of welfare spending . He had next to nothing to say about low pay , yet the financial modelling I conducted on Labour ’s plans for raising the national minimum wage shows that we could save three quarters of a billion pounds on housing benefit and tax credit costs . Surely getting to grips with the root causes is a better way to control rising welfare costs than attacking the incomes of the poorest ?
		65. As he seeks to reform local government , will the Minister also put in place proper measures to resolve something that has happened in my constituency ? Last weekend , there was a massive landslide , which has closed the road from Kintyre , meaning that business and tourism can not survive and people can not get through . I hope that local government , in conjunction with the Scottish Office , can realign that road away from the rock - fall area .
		66. Since the Jordanians are likely to suffer a loss of$3·6 billion largely due to export reductions , transient payments and lack of remittances from the Gulf , and since it is important to maintain stability in Jordan and the middle east , what ideas does my right hon Friend have for providing support to the Jordanian people during their crisis ?
		67. Will my hon Friend accept the congratulations of all water consumers on the initiative that his Department has taken in issuing this consultative document ? Does he agree that , to the majority of water users , regional water authorities are monolithic and bureaucratic , insensitive to their needs and deaf to their protests ? Therefore , in order to increase democratic accountability in the regional water authorities , might it not be a good idea to increase council representation and perhaps establish a water users ' consultative council ?
		68. Does the Minister accept that if democracy is worth having it must be paid for ? Is it not embarrassing to our democracy that some 3 million adults will be disfranchised in the election that will take place in a few weeks ' time ? Should that not be a matter of concern to the whole House ? Should not the Government now consider establishing an all - party Committee of the House to see how best we can tackle the problem and enfranchise all our country 's citizens ?
		69. Is my hon Friend aware that Northamptonshire county council is withholding the extra funds provided by the Government to pay for increased care for older people , and not passing the money on to care homes ? Is that happening elsewhere ? What will the Government do to ensure that the funds that they provide to pay for old people 's care are not withheld by local authorities and used instead on internal bureaucracy ?
		70. Only last week , the Secretary of State said about care : “ The…number of delayed discharges is broadly the same as it was last year and , I believe , from memory , the year before—I will correct the record if not.”—[ Official Report , 11 July 2012 ; Vol . 548 , c. 322 . ] Figures published by his own Department show the number of delayed days is up by 18 % in the last year and 29 % since August 2010 . Are Ministers completely out of touch with reality , or would the Minister now like to correct the record ?
		71. Are we ever going to get a fair deal for farmers or consumers when ruthless monopolies such as Tesco dominate our retail trade ? Tesco now has 30 % of the trade—by my economic training , that is a monopoly that any Government have to recognise and take on .
		72. Is my right hon Friend aware that a very sophisticated crowd control weapon was produced by one of our royal ordnance factories , submitted through the Home Office to the Cabinet , and rejected for use in this country ? Can he reconsider the matter to determine whether that weapon should be bought to avoid buying from abroad ?
		73. As the Government 's new rules on this issue are being tested in Europe before the Commission and the Court , will the Government obey the likely decision of the Court that these rules are invalid ?
		74. A constituency with dozens of reservoirs does not need any new ones , but as my hon Friend mentioned the resources plan , will he check that all the available powers have been used to monitor the filling of reservoirs , as I have a collection of photographs showing that culverts in my area are full of vegetation , animal matter and boulders , which means that the reservoirs have not been filled to capacity ? That waste of resources should be discouraged very strongly .
		75. Does the Minister realise that , if he abolishes the Potato Marketing Board , there will be a huge increase in the amount of potatoes fed to pigs and other livestock—the subject of this question ? Will he therefore give me an absolute assurance that he will make no decision regarding the Potato Marketing Board until he meets my hon Friends the Members for Glasgow Garscadden ( Mr. Dewar ) , for East Lothian ( Mr. Hume Robertson ) and for Cunninghame , North ( Mr. Wilson ) and me on 10 May at 3.45 pm ?
		76. Is the Minister aware that there is growing concern particularly among charitable organisations which want to offer high quality provision but are unable to do so due to inadequate funding , which they believe is not being met by the Government ? The feeling that local authority provision of residential care is inadequately funded is causing anxiety and worry to many families , and there is growing suspicion that some of the private organisations which have been set up are becoming money - making bodies . Will the Minister apply his mind to those problems ?
		77. The Ministry of Justice announced today that it had given two new contracts , worth £ 30 million of public money , to A4e . This company has been under investigation by the police , the Department for Work and Pensions and the Public Accounts Committee , and since I have been raising concerns about it , I have received 40 or 50 e - mails from members of the public alleging fraud and bad practice . Are the Government going to continue handing out public money to A4e ?
		78. The Minister says that a licensing scheme would be excessively burdensome and bureaucratic . Why is it that , before the last election , he issued a press statement saying that he would introduce licensing ? Does the Minister realise that his regulations fail to implement fully article 7 of the package travel directive ? What will he do to ensure that holidaymakers stranded abroad by travel companies that collapse are brought home at no extra cost ?
		79. As Home Secretary in a mature democracy whose courts have an unrivalled reputation throughout the world , has my right hon and learned Friend ever been tempted to seek to withdraw the United Kingdom from the jurisdiction of that foreign court ?
		80. Looking beyond 7 August , to the time when the right hon Lady takes her standing ovation at the Conservative Party conference , will she then pause to reflect on the sheer misery that she has created in thousands of homes throughout the United Kingdom as a result of the additional unemployment caused by her Government 's policies ? Will she then give further thought to the requirement upon her Government to halt the flow of fugitives from depression from develepment areas such as the Northern region ? If she can not do that , will she then tender her resignation ?
		81. As the Government have an excellent record in making more money available to the National Health Service in real terms , will my right hon Friend continue to encourage the growing contribution from the independent sector , which is helping to relieve pressure on the National Health Service and making more money available for health care as a whole ?
		82. Is the Secretary of State aware that during my visit to Dublin before Christmas I discovered a wide cross - party enthusiasm to push forward the provisions made in the Anglo - Irish Agreement for the inter - parliamentary tier and a wide belief that the British Government are holding up that progress ? Does the Secretary of State recognise that the distressing events which have occurred in the past three or four months have done severe damage , which he regrets as much as I do , to the Anglo - Irish Agreement ? One way of giving that agreement new impetus and direction would be for the Secretary of State to press forward with the inter - parliamentary tier provided for in the agreement .
		83. Is the Minister aware of the considerable anxiety in the county of Gwent about this matter ? Would not a reduction in crews be bound to affect the ambulance emergency services ? Despite what he said , will he intervene if Gwent health authority decides to consider such a proposal ?
		84. Is the Minister aware that the rapid pit closure programme has caused economic distress in many areas of the northern region , resulting in a much higher average rate of unemployment than in the rest of Britain ? To what extent is he satisfied with the trend in finding jobs for the long - term unemployed , particularly in south Yorkshire and the Barnsley travel - to - work area ?
		85. To put that impressive - looking list in perspective , will the Minister , first , tell us what proportion of existing RAF aeroplanes are airworthy , and secondly , confirm that the number of fast - jet fighter pilots is now almost 20 per cent . below manning levels ? Are we approaching through the back door the era of unmanned flight ?
		86. I am very grateful to the Minister for that answer . There is always a place for him in our team next year , although we are running trials in the next few weeks . Despite the generosity of the Minister ’s response , does he not accept that community pharmacies are of great and growing importance to our constituents and provide an ever - increasing range of healthcare and advice in accessible high street locations ? What message does he have for these dedicated professionals , who , frankly , now fear for the future due to the uncertainty arising from the announcement of a 6 % cut in funding for the NHS pharmacy service ?
		87. In what way is the decision to base the sub - strategic nuclear capability on Trident related to the decision , announced last week , to increase the number of warheads ? What would be the additional cost of the decision relating to the sub - strategic nuclear capability ?
		88. Through the Secretary of State , may I thank the Under - Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government , my hon Friend the Member for Great Yarmouth ( Brandon Lewis ) for visiting Kettering borough council last week ? Would the Secretary of State like to take this opportunity to congratulate the council , which for the past three years has frozen council tax , has not cut any front - line services and has maintained all its grants to the voluntary sector ?
		89. Does the Prime Minister plan to discuss with President Clinton the letter that he reportedly received from the President urging that the introduction of the single currency be delayed until after 2000 because the computer systems involved would be not only single currency non - compliant but , more crucially , millennium non - compliant , which would cause absolute chaos ? If the Prime Minister is as serious about the issue as he claims , why do his Whips continue to object to my private Member 's Bill , which would do much to protect British business from the millennium bug ? Will he ensure that the Bill receives its Second Reading on Friday 13 February , and will he read a copy of the Bill on Concorde tonight ?
		90. Is the Minister aware that it is impossible for a new patient in the Forest of Dean to find an NHS dentist ? That problem has been exacerbated recently by the fact that two very good NHS dentists have transferred to the private sector because they say that they can not cope on their fee level . Is she aware that that is a particular problem for the disabled , the unemployed , children and people on low incomes ? If we believe , as we do , that health care should be free at the point of need and that we should build capacity in that NHS service , why are we not doing so in dentistry ?
		91. I was reading about the case of a woman who is told by her boss each day whether or not she has work by a text with a picture of a happy face or a sad face . Should those practices be banned ?
		92. Does the Secretary of State recall , during the debates on privatisation , that Opposition Members were repeatedly told that inward investment opportunities from Europe and elsewhere would be enhanced by the regionally based nature of the privatised electricity companies ? Indeed , the White Paper went to some lengths to spell out the advantages of such companies . Notwithstanding what the right hon Gentleman has said today about the complications of the takeover bid for Northern Electric by Trafalgar , do the Government still believe in the principle of regionally based electricity companies—yes or no ?
		93. Does not the Secretary of State find it odd to be answering questions that should much more properly be answered by the Secretary of State for Education and Employment ? Is he doing so because the so - called new opportunities fund removes £ 3.7 billion from the good causes that should be funded from the lottery , and even if the money from the lottery goes up , it will do so by £ 3.7 billion less than it would otherwise have gone up ? Is he not ashamed of that , and would not he prefer to answer questions on culture , media and sport rather than on education , the environment and health ?
		94. Does the hon Lady recognise that Ministers are continually playing the old record which was left behind by the Secretary of State 's predecessor ? Since 1982 , inflation in the health service has been 49·9 per cent . , compared with a less than 35 per cent . increase in the retail prices index . Do the Government recognise that the health service is treading water where it is not drowning , that demographic changes and the increasing numbers of elderly people are flooding over our services and that it is not enough to mouth platitudes ? Resources are needed if community care is to be more than merely moving people out of institutions and if it is to mean providing adequate services for carers and those who are cared for in the community . Can we have the resources so that the job can be done ?
		95. I acknowledge the improvement in enforcement procedure that was brought about by the previous Minister in the Department of the Environment , but will the Government bear in mind the undesirability of that procedure resulting in planning decisions being taken , in the first instance , by the planning commission ?
		96. Will the Minister assure us that the Government are not out of line with our European partners in relation to subvention for shipbuilding ? Does he realise that the majority of our European partners would like to see subvention remain at about 20 per cent . for at least six months and then , if it must be reduced , have it reduced in a structured way and not by the massive 50 per cent . currently proposed ?
		97. Does the Secretary of State recognise that most independent observers agree that articles 2 and 3 represent one of the main obstacles to real co - operation within the island of Ireland ? Is he not surprised that even at this late stage , the Dublin Government have failed to make any positive contribution to removing an obstacle which could , if it were removed , have brought about better co - operation ?
		98. Does my right hon and learned Friend acknowledge that , notwithstanding the fact that we have spent more money on the police force in the capital , the process of civilianisation has managed to put more policemen on the beat in proportion to the number of officers who are brought into the service ? Perhaps he would like to correct the nonsense .
		99. I thank my hon Friend for that reply . Does he recognise that service charges are a great disincentive ? Is there any evidence that service charges in Cardiff are too high ? Will he consider encouraging exchanges in order to achieve greater mobility for council flat tenants ? Will he examine the possibility of the cash discount being used to purchase from the local authority or on the open market ?
		100. The whole House will want to congratulate the teams of car manufacturers and car manufacturing work forces , including that coming on stream in the great county of Derbyshire , which we still have with us . Does the Minister recognise that our car exporters have now fought their way back to their position of two years ago ? Our balance of payment deficit on cars was more than £ 2 billion last year . Does the Minister expect the balance of payments deficit to be £ 2 billion or less this year ?

	100 sample questions that were assigned type 2 (9750 total questions with this type) :
		1. I am grateful to my hon Friend for that answer and for the initiatives that have been taken to improve out - patient facilities . The improvements that have been made over the years in North Warwickshire district health authority are very much appreciated . How many new out - patient attendances were there in 1979 and how does that figure compare with those today ?
		2. May I point out to the Secretary of State that the document quoted by my hon Friend the Member for New Forest , East ( Dr. Lewis ) was an account of the military advice that had been given ? It said : " Military advice is that the fledgling European Security and Defence Policy mechanism is not ready to undertake an operation of this magnitude and risk . . . There would be a real risk that the EU 's first mission would end in failure " . By agreeing in Barcelona to an EU operation , has not the Prime Minister chosen to ignore the military advice for reasons of politics and nothing else ?
		3. Many manufacturers in Worcestershire are heavily reliant on their business with Rover . They will be none too pleased with the Labour Government 's completely incompetent handling of the Rover issue : they raised hopes and then showed their naivety by being taken for suckers . What is the latest on the Secretary of State 's proclaimed mission to find another buyer for Rover ? To whom has he spoken ? Who is on his nice little shortlist ? What are the prospects for a different deal ? What exactly has the beleaguered Secretary of State done—or was it just a Quixotic outburst ?
		4. Will my right hon Friend recognise the seriousness of the description of the Leader of the Opposition about the events that are alleged to have taken place ? Which Government were in power when those events took place ?
		5. I warmly congratulate my right hon Friend on his latest inward investment success and the major part that he played in bringing the Toyota engine plant to Shotton in the constituency of the shadow Secretary of State for Wales , who could never have brought it there had he tried . My right hon Friend did so without costing the taxpayer a penny . How many jobs will be created by that project in the engine plant Itself and among local component manufacturers and service industries ?
		6. Is there not something radically wrong with a society , country and Government when the Government boast of increasing defence expenditure during the whole of their tenure in office — unlike expenditure for most of the Departments that they run — claim that employment relies entirely on defence weapons being bought , and now boast that wealth and job opportunities depend on ever - increasing arms sales , mostly to Third world countries where the people are crying out for the supply of things that are much more essential to human life than arms ?
		7. Did the Prime Minister ’s intention to legislate to help people with the costs and insecurity of renting their homes lose its slot in a packed Queen ’s Speech legislative programme to the plan to ban plastic bags , or did he perhaps not have any such proposals in the first place ?
		8. By how many hundreds if not thousands of pounds will self - employed people lose out from the removal of working tax credits , which we will be discussing today , from working people , including the self - employed ?
		9. But what do my hon Friend and his colleagues intend to do about the fact that the European Parliament will progressively gather more powers by virtue of the legal framework that currently exists ?
		10. Was my right hon Friend the Housing Minister as angry as I was to learn that , notwithstanding 23,000 people looking for affordable homes in Liverpool , the Liberal Democrats rejected a project for 60 new homes by a housing co - operative on the grounds that there was no such need in the city ?
		11. Is it not about time we made our first social housing priority the building of council housing and repair of existing stock ? Should we not also reverse the policy of transferring council houses from the ownership of democratically elected councils to that of unaccountable housing associations ?
		12. Regarding the Minister 's target for 16 to 19-year - olds , will he confirm that currently 63 per cent . of 16-year - olds and 81 per cent . of 19-year - olds are not meeting the target ? With fewer than 1,000 days to go before the target is meant to be achieved , what new policies does he have ? Will he at least look at young offender institutions , where the target is already being exceeded ?
		13. Did my right hon and learned Friend notice that last summer the independent report into Leeds primary schools showed clearly that the schools that had had enhanced resources and more teachers could not show a positive correlation between extra resources and higher standards and , moreover , that the report highlighted the problem of teaching methods ? It said that far too many teachers had the perception that unless they followed the good practice set down by local authority advisers , their career prospects in the city would be blighted .
		14. I thank the Minister for his response . Will he explain why members of the security services have been involved in exercises entailing the use of Government facilities to forge documents ; the passage of arms , including guns and bombs , to members of the civilian community , to be used against members of the security services and individuals in Southern Ireland ; and political disinformation programmes such as " Clockwork Orange " during the 1974 election ? Who was authorising all that if there was no such unit ?
		15. If educational effectiveness can not be measured in terms of money spent , is it not even more the case that it can not be measured in terms of money cut ? Is the right hon Gentleman aware that his predecessor , the right hon and learned Member for Runcorn ( Mr. Carlisle ) , showed that less than 2 per cent . of all education expenditure was on administration and that the service is not overburdened with administrators ? Indeed , in some respects it is administratively underserviced . Will the right hon Gentleman accept that if efficiency means anything in education it means adequacy of provision ? How efficient does he think the 99 education authorities are which Her Majesty 's Inspectorate in its most recent report describes as not making adequate provision in essential areas in their schools ?
		16. The Secretary of State 's comments on this issue are interesting . If the Conservatives think that selective grammar schools are so good , why did Baroness Thatcher close so many and why has the Secretary of State no plans to open more ?
		17. Does the Minister share the frustration of my bee - keeping constituent , Mr. Burrows , who wants to import queen bees from Hawaii , as he has done before ? Is the Minister aware that the Department has said that Hawaii has a high bee health status ? While I am sure he would welcome a fact - finding mission to Hawaii , and I would gladly go with him , will he consult his wall map and see that Hawaii is 1,625 miles from mainland USA ? So will he get down to Brussels and tell officials to amend their rules , which are stopping my constituent producing the best honey ?
		18. May I satisfy the Opposition Front - Bench spokesman and give the Minister for the Cabinet Office good news by suggesting that even more money could be saved by relocating out of London and coming to Wellingborough ?
		19. Is it not a mockery for the Government , while forcing councils to push up council rents by about 40 per cent . , to say that they are fighting inflation ? Why does not the Minister come clean and say that the Government intend , during the lifetime of this Parliament , to phase out housing subsidies for council tenants ?
		20. Does my right hon Friend agree that far too much money is donated to and by trade unions without ballots and proper consultation ? Was that not illustrated last weekend by the unfortunate donation of £ 16,000 by the rock star , Bruce Springsteen , to support miners who were sacked during the strike , which probably also illustrates a lack of proper consideration and advice ?
		21. Is the Prime Minister now aware that she misled the House on Tuesday and that the pay - outs from the Secretary of State for Transport for those whom he sacked from the London Transport board were the responsibility of the Secretary of State , and not of the GLC ? Is she further aware that the proposed 6,000 redundancies on London Regional Transport will cost the taxpayers £ 36 million ? How will that assist travellers in London ?
		22. After all the cover - ups of the past , what is being done to ensure that the culture of the NHS is always improving , particularly in that patients are treated with dignity and respect and always have the highest standards of safety ?
		23. What will the right hon Gentleman do about the scandal of bunching private finance initiative contracts together and selling them on in the private sector , with no benefit to the public sector ? Is he going to take action , and if so , when ?
		24. Does that not reveal the double standard of the Tory Government ? They and their Back Benchers always want to attack local authorities and public utilities and force them to take action , yet they will not take the same powers to force private sector land to be sold , even though it is under - used , because they are too concerned with the rights of private property . In exactly the same way , they will not force private landlords to sell houses in the way that they are forcing local authorities to sell houses .
		25. Is not the Foreign and Commonwealth Office the sponsoring Department of MI6 and therefore of the intelligence information provided for the relevant dossiers ? When , therefore , did the Foreign Secretary first realise that the dodgy dossier was not an intelligence document , but , to coin a phrase , a horlicks ? Was it before he allowed United States Secretary Colin Powell to commend it to the United Nations Security Council as " exquisite " ? Was it before he allowed the Prime Minister to mislead the country by misrepresenting its status as further intelligence ? If he knew that it was not an intelligence document , did he tell them so , and if , as head of the sponsoring Department , he had not been told that this was not an intelligence document , should not some heads roll ?
		26. I want to reconsider the hon Gentleman 's previous answer . If it is true that there is a five - year agreement with Royal Ordnance factories , presumably the equipment that it would no longer produce if its factories were closed would be bought from somewhere ? As I understand it , the Minister has hinted that that equipment will come from Latin America and other countries . Bearing in mind that they are non - NATO countries , will he inform the House what guarantees he has that standards of manufacture , which have been an essential part of Royal Ordnance factory production , will be maintained ? Presumably the jobs at those factories will be re - exported to non - NATO countries .
		27. I am sure that all hon Members will welcome the speed of my right hon Friend 's response following his visit to the Sudan . The problem in that country is not so much the supply of relief but the means of getting it to the places where it is needed . During his visit , did my right hon Friend examine that aspect to see whether there was any way in which Britain could help with transport ?
		28. I thank my hon and learned Friend for that reply , but is he aware that there is a great deal more support in the rank and file of the trade union movement for the Government 's proposals than might appear from the pronouncements of leaders of unions affiliated to the TUC ? What practical steps can my hon and learned Friend take to ensure that the voice of the rank and file trade unionists who support these proposals is listened to ?
		29. After 16 years in power , is it not a demonstration of the Government 's utter failure that GDP continues to rise because they are paying the cost of economic failure by keeping so many people on the dole , at a cost of £ 9,000 per person ? When will the Government tackle the problems rather than the symptoms of their utter failure to adopt a decent economic policy ?
		30. Will the Solicitor - General advise the new Attorney - General to give up the seemingly new practice of attending Cabinet as a matter of course ? Does not that appear to put the Attorney - General in the position of being too close to the Government to advise objectively on matters such as the war in Iraq and the dropping of the prosecution of BAE ?
		31. That is indeed good news , but does my hon Friend agree that chief constables are probably wise to proceed cautiously with neighbourhood watch schemes , perhaps on a pilot scheme basis , in order to ensure that they have the wholehearted support of the general public , without which the schemes will not only fail but could be an additional drain on police resources , which are scarce ? Where the schemes are proven to be effective , will he consider increasing police establishments to enable more schemes to be set up , because neighbourhood watch schemes may help prevent crime and catch criminals , but they require additional policemen ?
		32. Not for the first time , may I put on record the Opposition 's continuing and consistent support for the project—which , you will recall , Madam Speaker , originated under the Conservative Government ? It is utter nonsense to pretend that we have criticised and carped about it . I have pointed that out several times in this place . While acknowledging that one of the many thousands of tasks that needs to be completed over the next 159 days is ensuring public safety , may I ask the Minister to join me in congratulating Jennie Page and all those working on the site , who have never lost heart in the project and have been inspired by it ? That inspiration—despite the regrettable public attitude that still exists—is the best hope that the dome will soon be a great success .
		33. Was there not something of a discrepancy between the recent speech by the chairman of British Rail and press reports of it ? Given one of the points that the present chairman made about the need for assistance to complete an environmentally acceptable link from London to the Channel tunnel , can my right hon Friend tell me whether the Government are unwilling to provide assistance or whether they believe that section 40 of the Channel Tunnel Act 1987 precludes them from doing so ?
		34. How much of that figure is available to British Rail for investment , because , increasingly , British Rail says that it is unable to meet the investment programme by reason of the constraints placed upon it by the Government ?
		35. Who will defend the fleet from aerial attack during the very long gap between the withdrawal of the Sea Harrier and the advent of the new carriers and the joint strike fighter ?
		36. Is not one of the main concerns of many Hong Kong people the fact that if we reach a satisfactory agreement with China it is important to obtain an assurance that it will last for a long time ? Is not the important question that of durability ? It is important for the maintenance of confidence in Hong Kong and for its prosperity . Did my right hon and learned Friend the Foreign Secretary press that point on the Chinese Government ?
		37. That is all very well , but the Minister must understand what is happening in places such as Cumbria , where people are being told on the one hand that their properties do not meet the commercial criteria for BT to go in , and on the other hand that Connecting Cumbria , the body set up to roll out rural broadband , does not have the funds available . These people do not care where their fast broadband is to come from , but they want to know that the Government are going to get a grip , so will the right hon Lady work with the Culture Secretary to address this problem urgently and give some hope to my constituents ?
		38. Many hon Members on both sides of the House , and people outside , will be deeply depressed by what the Secretary of State has said this afternoon . Why does he not put an end to the Government 's muddle , indecision and inactivity over the teachers ' dispute and announce that he has decided upon and agreed to set up an independent inquiry ?
		39. Does the Minister agree that China 's record on the death penalty is quite atrocious ? What is worse still is its policy of using without permission the vital body organs of condemned prisoners . When was that specific point raised by Ministers with their Chinese counterparts ?
		40. Is there not another side to all this ? Does not the process use a vast amount of water and involve chemicals as well ? It runs counter to all this green deal talk that we hear so often . Will the Minister ensure that all those reservations are taken fully into account ?
		41. Since we last met , we have seen the National Audit Office ’s devastating report on the Government ’s failure on broadband , which is extremely important to many people , but I am not going to ask the Government about that— [ Laughter . ] No , I am not , because also since we last met two children have taken their own lives following cyber - bullying ; that is also a matter of extreme concern to people in this country . I have arranged to see the Latvian ambassador to discuss whether ask.fm is co - operating properly with the police . The Government did not even mention social media in their summit conclusions or their communications paper . Why does not the Secretary of State put a legal obligation on social media sites to tackle cyber - bullying ?
		42. Prime Minister , could we get back to serious matters ? Given that there has never been a war in the history of the world in which the vast majority of victims have not been innocent civilians , does the Prime Minister agree that the time has come to create a world where there is no longer war or conflict ? Given his massive international respect , will he join together with other world leaders to create the means of ensuring that there is no longer any war or conflict in the world ? Does he agree that the best way of doing that , given that the European Union is the best example in history of conflict resolution , is for a special department of the European Union for peace and reconciliation to be created and to visit all areas of conflict with the principles of the EU , which will create a resolution of conflict anywhere in the world ? Will he and his international colleagues make that historic decision as soon as possible ?
		43. I heartily endorse everything said by the hon Member for Walsall , North ( Mr. Winnick ) . Those of us with constituents who were swindled out of their pension rights in that appalling case know of the anguish that they have suffered . Does my right hon and learned Friend recall that the Queen 's counsel who represented one of the Maxwell brothers before the Social Security Select Committee of which I was a member said that his client should not have to answer questions because he was on the threshold of being charged ? I remind my right hon and learned Friend that that was on 13 January .
		44. We are , I believe , winning the war in Afghanistan , but if we do not work together in political partnership , we will certainly lose the argument with the British people for the justification of the conflict . So does my right hon Friend agree that any attempt to play politics or point score while our troops are laying down their lives is beneath contempt ?
		45. Does the right hon Gentleman recall that on 23 September this year he said to a meeting of educationists , " I worry about the present extension of central control . I want more decisions to be taken at the rim of the wheel and fewer at the hub " ? If so , why is the right hon Gentleman poking his nose into the teachers ' negotiations ?
		46. Given the Secretary of State 's recent decision , as exemplified in the amendments in the other place to the paving Bill , should he not discuss with the leaders of ILEA , and explain to the House , his reasons for seeking extraordinary powers over such ILEA activities as building work , maintenance and contracts , when these powers are matters of detail and are contradicted by the Government 's statement on the Rates Bill that they would not seek to interfere in the minutiae of decisions ?
		47. Does the Chancellor accept that it is an accident of history that the means of digital communication , whether by telephone , broadcast , narrowcast , cable and so on , are the responsibility of several Government Departments— his own , the Home Office , the Department for Culture , Media and Sport and the Department of Trade and Industry ? What is his personal view on that ? Does he not think that it would be better were they encompassed within , and regulated by , one Government Department ?
		48. Are we not at a decidedly premature stage of the political talks for the Prime Minister to be inviting Mr. Adams to Downing street ? Does the Secretary of State not appreciate the public outrage when , only last week , a Sinn Fein council said that , if it did not get its own way , it would go back to what it knows it does best ? Let me assure the right hon Lady that , if we were still in office , we would not be inviting Mr. Adams to Downing street .
		49. Will the Prime Minister find time today to congratulate the Italian Government on the brilliant operation that has resulted in the liberation of General Dozier ? Was any help forthcoming from the Government ?
		50. May I offer my good wishes to the Foreign Secretary for his retirement and the appreciation of the House that he is answering questions today in what appears to be overtime in his post ? As this will be the right hon Gentleman 's last opportunity at the Dispatch Box , may I tempt him to show the same robustness as he showed last week when he described the views on the single currency of the challenger to the Prime Minister as a " Right wing extremist agenda " ? Was he at all surprised that well over a third of Conservative Back - Benchers voted for that right - wing extremist agenda ? Did that fact confirm him in his good sense in opting for retirement rather than continuing to pretend that any Conservative can represent Britain in Europe when half his party wants to be rid of Europe and three quarters of Britain wants to be rid of his party ?
		51. Tough content controls can stand separately from ownership requirements , so why not set ITV free as well ?
		52. Was recruitment to the industrial and non - industrial Civil Service greatly reduced as a result of the plan to reduce total numbers from 730,000 to 630,000 in the last five years , or was the reduction achieved mainly through natural wastage and voluntary resignations ?
		53. After a quarter of a century of Sianel Pedwar Cymru , the Welsh language fourth channel , being overseen from Wales and Westminster , does the Secretary of State agree with Plaid Cymru and the hon Member for Rhondda ( Chris Bryant ) that responsibility for it should be transferred to Wales , where the majority of Welsh speakers live ?
		54. Do the Government recognise that there is now a need for peace enforcement action by the UN Security Council to provide for a substantive increase in the African Union presence in Darfur , and a stronger mandate ? Without that , the situation there is so unstable and insecure that hundreds of thousands of refugees and internally displaced people will not feel safe and are unlikely to return .
		55. On my hon Friend 's answer in relation to flood rehabilitation , will he say how much of the increased aid is likely to go towards providing improved housing in Bangladesh , which has been severely damaged by the floods ?
		56. If the Minister is saying that the reserves have fallen by something approaching one third during this period , does that not mean that Britain 's balance of payments will worsen as a result of the ability to use those reserves and sell some of that oil abroad ? If that is the case , and if there are to be dwindling receipts from oil revenue , does it not make nonsense of allowing imported coal into this country , thus making the balance of payments deficit even worse ?
		57. I recognise the force of what the Minister said about increased productivity and improvement in techniques contributing to the increase in cereal growing . With respect to the period of time that he quoted , can he say to what extent grassland has been brought under the plough ?
		58. Is this not yet another example of the South African Government 's legal tyranny persecuting leaders of black opinion who are committed to non - violence ? Does the hon Gentleman agree that that underlines the failure of the so - called constructive engagement and how little has really changed in that appalling country ? Will the Government now start to isolate South Africa economically before we have to do so , following lamely after the Americans ?
		59. What the Home Secretary did not say , of course , is that gun crime is already up 90 per cent . under this Government . Does he really think that his jigsaw , which includes yet another departmental taskforce , yet another amnesty and more headline - grabbing attacks on the rap music industry , will seriously trouble hardened criminal gangs that use guns and feed off the crack cocaine trade ? If he thinks that his strategy will work , why does he not set a specific target , as he has done in many areas of Home Office policy , on reducing gun crime ?
		60. Is it not true that the building industry 's organisations have made it clear , both privately and publicly , that most of the land that is publicly owned and on the register is not suitable for most development , including large - scale housing development , and that one of the main reasons is that large areas of the land do not have infrastructure services ? Does the Secretary of State accept that the only way to get most of the land into use is for the Government to provide more capital to local authorities , and thus get the sites serviced and possibly made available for housing and other purposes ?
		61. When the Secretary of State eventually comes up with a coherent and intelligible question for the referendum on further powers for the Assembly , will she be asking the Electoral Commission to carry out a further consultation on the question she will place before the House ?
		62. I congratulate the Minister on his appointment but remind him that , speaking about the CSA a few weeks ago at Work and Pensions questions , when he was asking questions rather than answering them , he said : " We are fast approaching a point at which we shall be running two CSAs in parallel . That is not sustainable . Whose fault is it , and when will it be put right?"—[ Official Report , 8 November 2004 ; Vol . 426 , c. 553 . ] So I ask him , whose fault is it , and when will it be put right ?
		63. Last week ’s reshuffle was clearly a painful experience for many , but can the Prime Minister advise us why he recommended knighthoods for five of his redundant male Ministers , when there was “ nothing like a dame ” on offer for his sacked female Ministers ?
		64. When the Government started to move people from incapacity benefit to employment support allowance , provision was made for those who were particularly or very disabled so that they would not have to go through the work capability assessment and would go straight into the support group . However , a number of my constituents have been moved from incapacity benefit and on to the work - related activity group of ESA without first going through a work capability assessment . How widespread is this , how many people is it happening to , and why is it happening ?
		65. As the Minister responsible for propriety in Government communications , was the Cabinet Secretary consulted on the Prime Minister ’s recent letter to 2 million people , which used language borrowed directly from the Conservative party ’s website ? How much did that cost ?
		66. Will my hon Friend seek to strengthen our ties with Uganda and will he reassure the House of the importance that we attach to a party - based democracy in that country ? Does he believe , as I do , that the World Service of the BBC , which can regularly reach 68 per cent . of the population of Kampala , has a part to play in that ?
		67. But the Competition and Markets Authority has identified something I have been speaking about for quite a long time : that that sticky customer base is not being served well by energy suppliers . The CMA has said that about 70 % of customers on the standard variable tariff are paying over the odds , so has the Secretary of State looked into the suggestion I have made in the past year and previously that we need to protect those customers as well , and that a default or protection tariff could ensure that suppliers provide tariffs that are fair to their customers , and particularly those ones ?
		68. Does the Minister accept that one of the major causes of condensation and dampness in council property is that a great many council tenants can not any longer afford to have adequate heating in their homes ? When will the Government tackle that problem ?
		69. The White Paper offers only procedural tinkering with the Standing Orders of the Westminster Parliament while continuing to lock Scottish business into a voting procedure dominated by Tory votes from the south . Why can not the Secretary of State see that that is completely unacceptable to the vast majority of the Scottish people , who are demanding their own national Parliament under their own democratic control ? If he does not accept what I am saying , why does not he let the Scottish people speak for themselves in a multi - option referendum ? If he is not prepared to trust the Scottish people with such a referendum , why on earth should they be prepared to trust him with anything ?
		70. The Under - Secretary of State continues to plead how tragic it is for the industry that this dispute is continuing , and the hon Member for Enfield , North ( Mr. Eggar ) is alarmed about the implications for Selby . If Tory Members are so worried about damage caused to the industry , why do they not lift a finger and get the people involved around the table to solve the dispute ? Is the Secretary of State aware that he is profoundly mistaken if he believes that there is any political profit to be had in humiliating the miners and destroying mining communities ?
		71. Is the Minister aware that many people trying to claim benefits over the phone either can not get through or are told that they will be called back even though they do not have a phone ? The social fund commissioner 's office found that fewer than one in five calls were answered , so will the Minister end the Government 's complacency about the effect of the faceless state on people in real difficulties and ensure that those in particular need can either see a Jobcentre Plus official or have an official make the call on their behalf ?
		72. The Secretary of State will know from his previous incarnation that the department of artificial intelligence in Edinburgh is one of the most distinguished in the world . How , then , does he answer the point put by Dr. Henry Thompson and his colleagues who say , as do scientists at Imperial college , that the scheme can never come to fruition ? In the absence of a spare planet , which the Ministry of Defence presumably does not have , how is the testing to be done ? Unless there is a spare planet , there is no way that the scheme can be tested .
		73. My right hon Friend is right : capital funding is highly valued , and will transform the quality of education . That said , does he understand why I , like my colleagues in Stockton , was disappointed to read that we would lose £ 5 million from our Building Schools for the Future funding ? Can he explain why that is happening , and why it is based on something called the location factor ?
		74. Is the Secretary of State aware that I have received complaints that 17-year - olds are being refused places on youth training schemes until all 16-year - olds have been catered for ? Is that not foolish when young people have decided to take a further year of education to increase their 0-levels so that they will be better equipped for the YTS ? Is this a Government directive or a matter for local decision ?
		75. Is the Minister aware that in the United States , most school buses are yellow and that there is a regulation that those buses should not be overtaken by drivers who come up behind , so that the kids can cross in safety ? Having heard about the success of the experiment in Devon , will the Minister consider extending that experiment , or encouraging its extension , and will he look with an open mind at the similar scheme in the United States ?
		76. Why was the Foreign Secretary unsuccessful in stopping the former International Development Secretary ’s decision to restore aid to Rwanda , despite the breach of the memorandum of understanding between the UK and Rwanda—or was he fully in favour of that decision ?
		77. Bournemouth borough council has introduced microchip technology into the recycling wheelie bins throughout the borough . How might that technology be used ? How can financial punishments be used to encourage people to meet the targets that the Minister mentioned ?
		78. We recognise that free admissions have led , as the Secretary of State said , to a record increase in the number of visits to our national museums and galleries . That is why we are fully committed to the continuation of that policy . It was , of course , introduced by her predecessor , Lord Smith of Finsbury , who said last month that it was " difficult to overestimate the impact " that her raids on the lottery " had on the cultural sector."—[ Official Report , House of Lords , 17 May 2007 ; Vol . 692 , c. 342 . ] He called them a " serious error of judgment " and a " tragedy " , and called on the Government to admit their mistake . Free admissions was his legacy , but is not her legacy for the arts the siphoning - off of hundreds of millions of pounds from the arts and heritage sectors to pay for her mistakes on the Olympics budget ?
		79. Is the Minister aware of the independent report by the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux which says that 49 per cent . of pensioners ' applications to the social fund were refused and that the applications of up to 80 per cent . of young persons and unemployed people were refused ? Is he further aware that among those refused was a young woman who was due to have a baby in two days ' time ? She was refused a grant for a bed on the excuse that she could sleep on the floor , a disabled couple were refused a grant for a cooker on the ground that they could eat out , and a crisis loan was refused to a young man on the ground that he could eat out in soup kitchens ? Is this a success ?
		80. So often the House focuses on our armed forces in theatre and in conflict , but is it not also important that we celebrate our armed forces at home ? I hope that the House will forgive me if I celebrate in particular the work of the armed forces recently at the royal wedding , where they were so brilliantly turned out .
		81. I thank the Minister for that answer . My constituency has a number of defence and aerospace contractors , so will he join me in welcoming the 62 % growth achieved last year in defence exports and tell the House what support he has received from other Departments to ensure that that growth continues ?
		82. Although , as the Minister says , the security situation is relatively stable , and as a consequence troop numbers are at their lowest level for a generation , what contingencies does he have for reinforcing troop numbers if that is necessary , especially given the huge overstretch in the armed forces ?
		83. Was my hon Friend able to explain to the Russians that the excuse that Communism can admit no deviation without itself falling apart is not sufficient for the Western world to be able to devote any credence to their signature on any treaty ?
		84. In considering milk quotas , why has the right hon Gentleman not been prepared to address himself to the problems of the specialist dairy rearing sector ? Many of that sector 's members face virtual immediate bankruptcy , so why are they to receive no relief from the Government at this difficult time ?
		85. Does the right hon Gentleman agree with the statistical section of the House of Commons Library that , between 1979 and 1997 , there was a real increase of 72 per cent . in spending on the police , which meant an increase in police strength of 15,000 ? Under his plans , there will be no real increase in spending whatever between 1997 and 2001 . Does that not mean an inevitable reduction in the strength of police forces ?
		86. When my hon and learned Friend met Dick Turpin and the rip - off bill merchants , I hope he said to them that it was not on and that the time had come for a windfall tax . Did he also ask them why they failed to invest in storage capacity , as a result of which gas prices are being kept artificially high ?
		87. Who does the Minister hold responsible for the decline in the performance of young working - class white children in our schools ? Does he take any responsibility for the policies of the last 10 years that have led to that decline ?
		88. Is not the Minister 's argument based on a fallacy ? He is not considering the overall impact on road casualties and deaths . If speed cameras are so effective , why were more people killed on our roads last year than in 1998 ?
		89. Is the Minister aware that if , like me , he had attended the inquest on the New Cross fire he would agree that that inquest did enormous damage to the processes of justice and to race relations ? Is he further aware that where serious allegations are being made against the police it is inappropriate that a coroner should preside ? Coroners rely heavily upon the police and Co not have the sort of experience that a High Court judge might have , as Lord Scarman is now exhibiting , of conducting proceedings even - handedly ? Does he accept that it is more appropriate in those cases that the Home Secretary should have the power to bring in a judge instead of leaving the issues to coroners ?
		90. Will the Home Secretary acknowledge that hundreds of police officers are involved in keeping prisoners in police and court cells in London and southeast England , and this despite his firm commitment to clear those cells by the beginning of the year ? Was it not cynical of him to stick by that commitment for two or three days only before the prisoners were back in those court cells ? They now number 200 or so every night .
		91. On 17 March , the Prime Minister said that UK defence spending had fallen in real terms on one or two occasions . I think that " once or twice " was the term that he used . According to everyone else , it has certainly fallen twice , and has possibly fallen three or four times . Was what the Prime Minister said about its having fallen " once " true ?
		92. I apologise for the fact that my right hon Friend the Member for Don Valley ( Caroline Flint ) is at a hustings in Scotland this morning , and is therefore unable to be present . As this is the first session of Energy and Climate Change questions of the new Parliament , let me take the opportunity to welcome the Secretary of State and the Minister to their positions . Will the Minister explain how , given a fixed renewables target and a fixed budget , replacing the cheapest renewable electricity technology—which is onshore wind—with more expensive technologies can possibly lead to lower bills for consumers ?
		93. Would it not add to the spirit of comradeship on the Opposition Benches if my hon Friend were to publish in the Official Report a list of those Opposition Members and Labour councillors who have taken advantage of our right - to - buy legislation ?
		94. Does the Minister understand that those of us who live between Queensferry and Flint are having a torrid time , with huge traffic jams and much environmental blight ? Why does not the Minister bring forward the Holywell bypass start date ? Is there not proof that the much mooted river road should be started early ? Will the Minister cut the waffle and give us some action ?
		95. Is the Minister aware that since the changes in petroleum revenue tax announced in the Budget , the Chancellor of the Exchequer is now known by the United Kingdom offshore oil industry as the driller killer ? is he aware that the industry expects a 30 to 40 per cent . cut in the number of wells drilled , which could mean a cut of 40,000 jobs in the offshore sector ? Does he agree that the damage that will flow from the changes in PRT is unacceptable ? Did the Chancellor of the Exchequer consult the Minister before the announcement was made and what does the Minister intend to do to restore confidence in our offshore exploration industry ?
		96. If the Prime Minister visits Drongan will she compare the excellent local authority sheltered housing there with the old people 's homes highlighted recently in The Sunday Times ? Will she ask the Secretary of State for Social Services and the Attorney - General to look into the laws governing old people 's homes and the case of Olive St. Barbe in particular ?
		97. I concur with the sentiments expressed by my hon Friend the Member for Chorley ( Mr. Hoyle ) in an earlier question . With electricity prices reported to be four times higher in the United Kingdom than in France , and with the impact that that has on UK businesses and particularly on energy - intensive users , does my right hon and learned Friend agree that one way to bring prices down is to increase capacity ? The best way to do that is to extend the lives of existing generators , including safe nuclear power generators . Will she urge her Cabinet colleagues to do that , to ease the burden on British business ?
		98. I am grateful for that answer . Is my right hon and learned Friend now satisfied that the Crown prosecution service has settled into its task ? It has attracted a great deal of criticism from various parts of the country , but does my right hon and learned Friend agree that it is now doing a fine job , prosecuting and dealing expeditiously with many cases ?
		99. Has my right hon Friend had a chance to read the latest report on IT procurement by the Select Committee on Public Administration , which includes the Government ’s response to our original report ? We commend the Minister for that response , but there is further progress to be made . In particular , how will the Minister tackle the cartel - like behaviour of the large prime contractors ?
		100. Is my right hon Friend aware of the widespread interest in this House and in the country in the meeting which she had yesterday with Mother Teresa of Calcutta ? After meeting this very remarkable woman , does she agree with Mother Teresa 's assertion that the poorest nations on earth are those that substitute the violence of abortion on demand for love and practical help ? Will my right hon Friend therefore ensure that the amended Bill before the House at the moment , which had a substantial majority on Second Reading and which has passed its Committee stage after reasonable debate and amendment , will have a fair run , and will not be baulked , and that the nation , where we have a majority on this issue , will not be baulked either ?

	100 sample questions that were assigned type 3 (3043 total questions with this type) :
		1. Does the Prime Minister now understand how foolish he was to claim last October that the closure of 31 pits was—and I quote him directly—"economically unavoidable and better done cleanly and quickly " ?
		2. Well - supported neighbourhood plans and agreed local plans are critical to good local planning and housing . How does the Secretary of State aim to hold to account councils that fail to deliver agreed and well - supported local plans by early 2017 , and those that fail to support and encourage neighbourhood plans and hence the right mix of local housing ?
		3. Bearing in mind that this is the centenary of Disraeli 's death and that he attached great and real importance to sanitation , will my hon Friend think again and do something special in this regard to commemorate that great Conservative statesman ?
		4. Given that one in five children in this country has identified special educational needs , what measures will the new Government take to ensure that they are able to access the same level of funding and services for the provision of their teaching that they enjoyed under the previous Administration ? How will any such measure fit into the new free school model that the Government propose , given the role currently played by local authorities in providing those services ?
		5. It is welcome that so many petrol stations are making unleaded petrol available , but the Minister understands that the real test is the number of cars using it . What discussions are being held within the Department or with Treasury Ministers and officials to encourage the take - up of unleaded petrol by giving further tax incentives or cuts in petrol prices ?
		6. How can we encourage staff on our railways to make announcements on the trains to help visually impaired passengers when visual displays are either not fitted on the trains or , as is the case most of the time , not working ?
		7. Having regard to the prevalence of the crime of mugging , extending , according to reports , to British Legion poppy sellers , will my right hon Friend spare time today to discuss with her right hon Friend the Home Secretary ways of speeding up measures to enforce law and order ?
		8. At my surgeries I have met residents who have come to see me because they are anxious about having been ripped off or having been victims of mis - selling . What will the proposals do to help them get their money back ?
		9. Given the escalating number of heroin - using offenders , escalating demand for heroin treatment and the fact that the vast majority of heroin addicts started on cannabis , will the Home Secretary reconsider the relaxation of the law on cannabis ?
		10. May I take a different view from the hon Member for Moray ( Angus Robertson ) and congratulate the Government on the very hard work that they have been doing over the past month to insert amendments into the clauses of the new constitution ? I stress that the biggest advantage for Scotland is probably its nearness to the Norwegian fields , and the vital ability of our Government to sign a deal with another nation will be under threat if we do not have specifically in the constitution—it is not in the amendments that we saw today at the European Scrutiny Committee—provision for the right of a sovereign Government to sign a treaty with another nation without the EU keeping that competence to itself .
		11. Is it not true that a record number of jobs are being created in tourism , and that this service industry is one of the most promising areas for growth in employment ? What was the value of tourism to Britain last year , and how many people were employed in the industry ?
		12. I welcome the unpaid Under - Secretary to his new Department and I am sorry that my campaign to get him a salary has not worked . We shall keep on trying . Has the hon Gentleman examined the detailed statistics on new deal and the gateway ? How many people complete the gateway but do not gain access to any schemes or employment ? How many people who completed the gateway had their benefits stopped because they did not accept a place on any scheme ?
		13. What good has come of this sorry state of affairs ? Will the hon and learned Gentleman confirm that as a result of it all sit - ins and work - ins are now liable to criminal proceedings ? Now that the case is over in the courts , will he initiate a public inquiry to see how the thing started in the first place ?
		14. How can the right hon and learned Gentleman claim that the matter is kept under constant review when , as recently as 22 November 1979 , in a written reply he was unable , as was the Director of Public Prosecutions , even to supply the average time taken to consider the cases that are submitted ? Does not that indicate that the Director 's office is incompetently managed ?
		15. Given that misinformation verging on conspiracy theory is emerging from various quarters about the impact of TTIP , what more can the Minister and his colleagues do to promote and highlight the economic and trade advantages that a successful agreement would bring to this country ?
		16. The bank 's mandate clearly states that it must work only in countries committed to democratic principles , yet it has recently provided significant funding to Belarus , Uzbekistan and Azerbaijan . That is yet another example of an inherent contradiction within European institutions . Others include the EU water initiative , which has failed to provide access to water for a single individual . Moreover , a recent Save the Children report states that the EU is consistently the worst performer in disbursing aid and is mired in bureaucracy . What is the Minister 's strategy to improve the EU 's aid effectiveness , and what pressure is he putting on the bank to ensure that there is progress in both political and economic transition in these ex - Soviet republics ?
		17. The Minister glossed over the unavailability of statistics . How could he sign an agreement and put it before the House when , even now , he does not have details of the quotas on imports up to 1986 ? What is the Minister doing about reducing restrictions on our exports of clothing and textiles to such countries as America , Australia and Brazil , whose tariff barriers are vast compared with our modest restrictions ?
		18. What 's all this here then ! Is the Home Secretary saying that despite the comments of the chairman of the Tory party the other day about departing from Christian values , the permissiveness of the 1960s , and so forth , he will not only vote for Sunday trading , but will relax the licensing laws as well ? I do not know what the Tory party is coming to .
		19. Does the Secretary of State agree that the declaration addressed two questions—first , the circumstances in which a united Ireland could be achieved , which is a purely hypothetical question as there is clearly no consent for such an outcome , and , secondly , how the IRA could enter democratic politics if it so wished , although it is perfectly clear that it does not so wish ? Given the response to those hypothetical questions , does the right hon and learned Gentleman further agree that the declaration is an irrelevance and can not be used as the basis for future institutions and should not be used by him as an excuse for not implementing arrangements for stability in Northern Ireland that he knows have the most widespread acceptance ?
		20. Given the £ 180 million overrun on phase one , will the Government be tempted to backfill with second - rate private finance initiative buildings ? What role will PFI have in the programme ?
		21. A record number of people registered to vote in the Scottish independence referendum— 97 % of the adult population . What efforts are the UK Government making to match that success ?
		22. How much importance do the Government ascribe to research and development and diversification as ways of sustaining our manufacturing base in the face of increasing global competition ?
		23. Will the Chief Secretary first confirm that public sector debt was 42.5 % in 1997 and 36.5 % in 2008 , the second - lowest debt of any G7 country ? Will he secondly accept that investment during the last two years of the Labour Government was designed to keep people in their jobs and homes , expenditure that he supported at the time ? Given the disastrous economic figures and the CBI 's comments before Christmas , will he just admit that what he is missing is a growth strategy , not the cuts that he opposed during the election ?
		24. Given all the grandiose schemes that nationalised industries are putting forward , although those industries are losing thousands of millions of pounds , will my right hon Friend ensure that no more Government money is invested in such a scheme and that , if the Government have money to spare , they will use it to improve our road system , which is a disgrace to a civilised country ?
		25. At present , GPs are able to spend only about eight or nine minutes on average with each patient . How can the Secretary of State expect GPs to be meaningfully engaged in commissioning when , unlike him , they are putting patients first ?
		26. Carers—and , I hope , the Minister—local authorities and GPs will be distressed by this week ’s report of care companies being investigated by Her Majesty ’s Revenue and Customs , almost half of which were found not to be paying the minimum wage . How does tackling that problem at the heart of our care system fit into the Minister ’s plans to help support carers ?
		27. My hon Friend should note that that is one up for London . Given the positive joie de vivre with which his appointment as Minister responsible for London 's transport was greeted , would he like to tell the Evening Standard what it can do with its criticisms of him ? Will my hon Friend do his best to accelerate the trend of people moving to trains and away from cars by introducing road pricing around London 's perimeters ?
		28. Given the large and worrying number of people who say that they do not understand why our forces are in Afghanistan , does the Secretary of State acknowledge that there is a need to define the mission better , and to propagandise it ?
		29. Sentinel aircraft based at RAF Waddington in my constituency play a vital role in the fight against Daesh , so may I welcome the Department ’s announcement of £ 130 million support contract funding from our growing defence budget ? Will the Minister confirm how many jobs that will sustain ?
		30. Given the negative impact that rocket attacks from Gaza into Israel have had on public opinion about Israel , and the fact that they are therefore wholly counterproductive , what discussions has the Foreign Secretary had with Arab countries , notably Egypt , to secure a permanent cessation of rocket attacks for the reasons that he has spelled out ?
		31. In my constituency , our schools are short of money , the tax credits are a shambles and remain unpaid , we have a failing hospital and we are short of 200 police officers . What my constituents want to know , Prime Minister , is this : given that we are paying more taxes , why , under your Government , does nothing work ?
		32. Given the tremendous work of reconstruction carried out by our brave troops in Iraq over the past three years , but given also the fact that there is a fast - diminishing prospect of further positive achievement in the face of the growing sectarian violence in that country , is it not time now , with honour and dignity and pride , to bring our troops home ?
		33. I thank the Deputy Prime Minister for his answer , and associate myself with his comments about our two former colleagues , recently departed . The Deputy Prime Minister referred to the work of the New Zealand Government . He will know that legislation will soon be needed to enable those changes to be made , and that it will be initiated in the House of Commons . Given his unenviable record of success in relation to constitutional change , may I suggest that he pass responsibility for the legislation to another Minister , so that there will be some chance of its actually being introduced ?
		34. Given the significant number of pensioners in my Fylde constituency , may I welcome the sweeping reforms announced by the Chancellor earlier this year ? What plans will be put in place to make sure that those pensioners who access their own money get sound advice ?
		35. In a newspaper interview last weekend , the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change cast doubt on the viability of investment in the civil nuclear energy industry . Given the strategic importance of the industry and the need for certainty and commitment from the Government , can the Prime Minister reassure the House and business that his policy is unaltered in that area ?
		36. Given the rising price of food and the impact that that is having on hard - pressed families and hard - pressed farmers , what is the Prime Minister intending to do to secure a steady supply of food for this country , at reasonable prices , but with a stable income for our farmers ?
		37. In my advice surgery on Friday , a young couple came to see me in Darwen to say that they were £ 30 a week worse off for living together . It is a shameful legacy of the previous Government that people are worse off for living in couples and worse off when they go back to work . What this couple and everyone else in Darwen wants to know the answer to is : when will the universal credit end this situation ?
		38. Surely the actions of the South African Government have not contributed to solving the outstanding issues that are preventing a settlement . What representations are the Government making to the South African authorities that they should not take actions that make it difficult to achieve the settlement that we all want ?
		39. Is the Minister satisfied with that low figure of prosecutions , given that evidence suggests that smoking among those under 16 is widespread and that the law is being totally ignored ? Given the number of deaths from smoking every year , will the hon and learned Gentleman take action to see that the law is enforced ?
		40. Given the difficulty that the blind seem to be having in gaining access to the Public Galleries , does my right hon Friend not feel it outrageous that convicted terrorists are gaining access to Committee Rooms ?
		41. Poor attendance , as well as extremely poor educational attainment , is a feature of the most recent Ofsted inspection at the Voyager academy in Walton , Peterborough , which is managed by the Comberton academy trust . May I encourage the Minister and the Secretary of State to use their powers to intervene on this first wave academy to replace Comberton with a much more suitable academy trust for the benefit of pupils in my constituency and beyond ?
		42. Given how few Government Bills have been programmed for this Session , will the Lord Chancellor proceed to introduce legislation if those on the Conservative Front Bench confirm their agreement to replacing an unelected second Chamber with an elected second Chamber ?
		43. What useful purpose will be served by this meeting ?
		44. Is it not the case that only skin cancer and breast cancer referrals are meeting that 62-day target ? Is it not unsurprising that the survival rate over 10 years is 78 % for breast cancer and 89 % for skin cancer , whereas it is 35 % for ovarian cancer and 57 % for bowel cancer ? How does the Minister feel about these excess deaths , and what is he going to do to ensure that people with these cancers are treated in time ?
		45. Thank you , Mr. Speaker , and may I also welcome you to your new role ? Many of us here will welcome the fact that the Prime Minister has rowed back from holding an inquiry into Iraq in private . It would have been a misjudgment to do so . That said , the Opposition motion and the amendment before us this afternoon contain two points of difference—whether the terms of reference are discussed and published , and whether the committee should have a wider composition . What can the Prime Minister say to the House to address those two points of difference ?
		46. Given the difficult security situation , which is likely to continue for some time , and the desire of the Afghan Government and their people for troops to remain in Afghanistan for a protracted period , does the Secretary of State foresee an extension to the deployment beyond July ? Will British troops be part of that ? What will trigger a withdrawal ?
		47. Given that , when we talk about fuel poverty , we are actually talking about poverty itself , what specific measures are being targeted at people who live in council houses ?
		48. Is my right hon Friend aware that ferries from Dover are having great difficulty in taking any lorries at all , because of the blockade of Calais ? Is not it unreasonable that Dover ferry companies and haulage companies should lose vast amounts of money in the current circumstances ? Many of my constituents are stranded in France with lorries and are unable to come back home to their families . French police are forcing British lorry drivers to join blockades to help the French lorry drivers ' strike . Can my right hon Friend confirm the serious allegations , which may turn out to be true , that the channel tunnel was sabotaged by a striking French lorry driver ? Is this not an appalling state of affairs ? What will happen about compensation , because , the last time the French promised it , they never paid up ?
		49. How do the figures for external migration compare with those in the Republic of Ireland , which follows a different set of economic policies ? Does my hon Friend agree that the right kind of policy is to build on the success of the Highlands and Islands Development Board , which , for the first time in more than a century , has secured a stemming of the tide of emigration from at least that part of Scotland ?
		50. Given the monitoring of employment that is carried out by the Minister 's Department , to which the hon Member for Billericay ( Mrs. Gorman ) referred a few minutes ago , and the allegations in today 's editions of The Guardian , The Times , The Daily Telegraph and the sewer press by the Secretary of State about the claiming of unemployment benefit by my constituents in Coventry and the west midlands , what about the other side of the coin ? How many officers at the jobcentres are employed by his Department to ensure that every unemployed person gets his full entitlement to benefit ? What is his Department 's advertising budget to ensure a full and fair take - up of employment benefit ? [ Interruption . ] If allegations are to be made in the Chamber about unemployed workers moonlighting , which activity is not surprising given the poverty level of benefits , I can only says that when every Tory Member of Parliament has only one job— [ Interruption ] —it will be a little less hypocritical of them to lecture working - class people about moonlighting .
		51. Given the parlous state of the public finances and the need to borrow so extensively internationally , does the right hon Gentleman not understand that the failure to bring forward a comprehensive spending review will make it even more difficult and uncertain to borrow from the capital markets ?
		52. I am sure that we can all agree that the pharmaceutical sector is one of the most successful industrial sectors in this country . Has my right hon Friend noticed , however , that the sector has lost 8,000 jobs in the past three years ? The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry and the CBI have recently reported on that fact . Will she be having discussions with either of those organisations ?
		53. I thank the Minister for that answer . I am sure he will be aware of a report published today by Citizens Advice entitled “ Right First Time ? ” , which examines the high level of incorrect and inaccurate decisions made in the work capability assessment . Given the amount of money that Atos Healthcare receives from the public purse for undertaking these assessments , is it not now time for the Government to consider the report ’s recommendation that financial penalties be imposed on Atos for a number of those incorrect assessments ? [ Interruption . ]
		54. The Secretary of State has said that to some degree he accepts the resentment and anger in Northern Ireland about the action that Her Majesty 's Government are contemplating . Can he outline to the House what pressure Sinn Fein - IRA brought to bear on the Government to make them contemplate on - the - run terrorists being given an amnesty in the face of such opposition , not only in this House , but right across the communities in Northern Ireland ?
		55. Given the difficult security situation in Yemen , will the Minister outline UK priorities in that country ?
		56. As my hon Friend the Minister says , the main objective must be to minimise waste , because even in counties such as Lancashire we are running out of holes in the ground in which to dump the rubbish . Does he believe that we have satisfactory arrangements and plans for the authorities that are responsible for the collection and disposal of waste ? There are supposed to be plans for the whole country . Are they working in the best way for minimising waste that goes to landfill ?
		57. I thank the Secretary of State for that answer , but what is being done to find out what is being done in classrooms around the world so that our students can meet the higher standards and compete with the best ?
		58. Notwithstanding that reply , may I ask whether the Minister is aware that the director of the Merseyside Arts Association , Mr. Peter Booth , is reported as having said last Friday that he is fed up with hearing that everything is safe , that the crisis is still a deep one , and that some £ 600,000 will be required to save the philharmonic , the Everyman , the Playhouse and 30 other smaller art groups on Merseyside ? What hope is there of that £ 600,000 being found ? What co - operation is the Minister receiving from the five district councils on Merseyside ?
		59. I thank my hon Friend for that answer , but can she say how much the Government are actually investing in the low - carbon industries and what the economic benefits will be ?
		60. Has the Secretary of State read the comments of Davina Lloyd , the head of Coopers Company and Coborn school—a top state school—in The Times today ? She said : " Leave us alone—let us get on with things and stop inundating us with bits of paper and bureaucracy . " Given her comments and the survey by the National Union of Teachers , which showed that the growing tide of regulation and initiatives from the Department are a major factor in teacher resignations , what initiatives will she cut to stem the tide of resignations ?
		61. Given the Secretary of State 's comments on the radio yesterday about the role of the other place in this matter , and the subsequent revised advice that the other place can indeed consider both the flat rate community charge and other schemes , what representations does he expect to receive from the other place in the next three months ?
		62. I thank the Secretary of State for his answer , but may I ask him about a specific school in Halifax ? Moorside primary school has been promised a new build , but under Government cuts the local community fears that the plans will be shelved . Will he confirm to the House if and when that will happen , as the school desperately needs modernisation ?
		63. Given 1,200 job losses at Tata in Scunthorpe and further job losses in the private and public sectors in north Lincolnshire , will the Prime Minister meet with the taskforce chair and local MPs , so that he can understand how his Government can help the local economy face these demands positively and respond positively to future challenges ?
		64. What will the Minister do about local authorities such as Liberal Democrat - controlled North Wiltshire district council ? Some five years ago , it sold off all of its council houses for £ 90 million and has since spent some £ 50 million of that money on assorted schemes , but has not built one single house , until now , when it is spending £ 25 million on building a new headquarters for itself . North Wiltshire has problems with empty homes and housing , but what can we do about the Liberals there ?
		65. Given the importance of the Russia - Crimea issue to the NATO summit , and given the importance of the UK ’s showing leadership at the summit , does it not provide a unique opportunity for us to make a statutory commitment to spending no less than 2 % of our GDP on defence ?
		66. May I congratulate the Minister on his new role . As my hon Friend the Member for Gedling ( Vernon Coaker ) mentioned , carers of people with autism rely on respite care . However , carers organisations are reporting that cuts to local authority funding are already leading to cuts in funding for charities and other providers of support care . How do the Government plan to deliver the promised increase in access to respite care through improved community support provision , when that is already starting to fall away ?
		67. What pressure is the Minister putting on the Department of Trade and Industry to make the boiler conversion scheme more effective ? Does he agree that if the grant were increased from 25 per cent . , if the scheme were extended beyond this year and , above all , if the scheme were made available to the whole of the public sector , a more significant contribution would be made towards making the coal industry viable ?
		68. Given the tax increases that have taken place , especially the changes to advance corporation tax and the abolition of personal equity plans and tax - exempt special savings accounts , what are the Government going to offer people who have an acceptable disposable income to induce them to take up a stakeholder pension ?
		69. I thank my right hon Friend for her answer and congratulate her on leading the world in a vital initiative which may do more than many other things to relieve poverty . She has mentioned that the money will be spent on things such as health and education . How is that spending being monitored and what can we do to ensure that countries that are benefiting from debt relief do not fall into new debt ?
		70. As vice - chair of the all - party parliamentary group on nuclear energy , I am extremely keen to get more women into the nuclear industry and into studying STEM subjects at school and university , because we can not meet the skills shortage without attracting more women and girls into engineering . I was therefore really pleased to hear the Minister agree with my hon Friend the Member for Stretford and Urmston ( Kate Green ) about the need to get in much earlier , at primary school level , if girls are going to take that subject right the way through to higher education . What specific action are the Government taking to achieve that aim , and how will they take into account the good work that we are already carrying out in west Cumbria ?
		71. What precise act of brilliance justifies the payment of an £ 85,000 bonus to one of the Secretary of State ’s civil servants ? Will the Secretary of State make a bid for his own bonus for today becoming the first Minister to stop blaming the previous Government for all his problems , and tell the House on what precise date the coalition Government will take responsibility for their own conduct ?
		72. Given the absence of provisions for recycling in the Environmental Protection Bill , will the Minister arrange for the report to be printed in full and then immediately introduce legislation to implement that report ?
		73. I thank the hon Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr ( Adam Price ) for raising the matter of urban post offices . We hear a lot about the problems with rural post offices . What is the Minister 's relationship with Postwatch , the organisation that looks after the interests of post office consumers ? What is his approach to urban post offices such as those in my constituency , of which well over a third are likely to be closed in the next 12 months ?
		74. Is my right hon Friend aware that traffic problems in London were much better dealt with when they came under the direct authority of the Department of Transport ? Given the real problems arising from bus lanes , coaches parking on roads and the appalling so - called traffic management schemes that were introduced at the Aldwych by the GLC , is it not high time that my right hon Friend resumed responsibility for London transport ?
		75. What budget has the Secretary of State allocated to research on AIDS ? What proportion will this be of the entire health budget ? What research projects are being carried out internationally into this disease ?
		76. In opening , the Minister rightly mentioned transition . Given the concerns about members of the armed forces ’ transition that were highlighted in the recent review by Lord Ashcroft , which of his recommendations will the Ministry of Defence be taking forward ?
		77. While I accept that a grant - based system meant runaway costs that no Government could continue , what should I say to an old man in my constituency , with savings of less than £ 200 , who applied to the social fund for a bed and was told to use those savings ?
		78. Given the Prime Minister 's sudden attack of double standards over Afghanistan and South Africa , how does she feel about American intervention in Central America ?
		79. What recent consideration have Ministers given to allowing authorities such as Poole , Bournemouth and Dorset to share transit sites for Travellers , given the lack of space in the conurbation and the great need for the police to be able to invoke section 62 powers when , for example , play areas become unavailable for use by local children during the school holidays ?
		80. Given the appalling devastation that rhizomania can mean for sugar beet farmers , because the sterilisation of affected land can last for 25 years , will my hon Friend listen sympathetically to the demands of the National Farmers Union , which is seeking a statutory system of compensation for consequential losses for growers of sugar beet affected by rhizomania and a code of practice to protect sugar beet farms from the coercion of contractors , in particular ?
		81. I am grateful to the Minister for that answer . When the previous Government left office , apart from the record deficit , they left an extra 270,000 young unemployed . How are the Government working with business to ensure that new apprenticeships are what our economy needs to tackle youth unemployment and that we do not repeat the mistakes of the previous Government ?
		82. Will the Secretary of State be less aggressive and more apologetic about the figures that are the answer to this question ? The answer that the Under - Secretary , the hon Member for Orpington ( Mr. Horam ) , gave me last month showed that , in the Northern and Yorkshire region , there were 1,200 cancellations on the day of admission or after , and 75 which failed the citizens charter standard . In my area , the corresponding figures were 350 and 75 . Nationally , there were 50,000 cancellations and 6,000 cancellations that failed the citizens charter standard for readmission within one month of the original date . What will the Secretary of State say to the family of Queenie Harrild , who died in Guy 's hospital and whose inquest is this week , when the citizens charter is regularly breached and thousands of patients continue to be admitted to hospital and then sent home , some of whom die before their operation ?
		83. Travel to the west country is often massively disrupted by incidents between Reading and Paddington . Given the huge investment that has gone into Reading station , is it not possible to find alternative means of connectivity between Reading and London—Reading is virtually becoming a London station—so that people from the west country can get in and out of London perfectly easily ?
		84. The Lord Chancellor has indeed had something to say about the reform of the court system this morning . May I say “ Well done ” for spotting the gaping inequality in the justice system that his predecessor has created ? Did he have in mind the 89 % fall in social welfare legal aid cases under the previous Government—legal aid for the very poorest—or his own further cut in criminal legal aid announced last week ? The president of the Law Society said that that cut could “ undermine the criminal justice system to the point that it may no longer deliver fair outcomes . ”
		85. I know that the Minister is aware of widespread concern among businesses in the outdoor activity and leisure sector about the possible health and safety impact of the new " work at heights " directive . More than 40 respected organisations from throughout the sector have come together to suggest an alternative regulatory approach to the one currently proposed by the Health and Safety Commission . Will she assure me that she will support such an approach , which would ensure that professionals whose lives depend on their safety judgments would continue to have the final say on safety in their businesses , thus avoiding the threats to businesses in the industry and the nonsense inherent in the directive ?
		86. Given the expressed view of the chairman that , following the removal of the duty to supply from the Central Electricity Generating Board to the consumer , responsibility for maintaining medium and long - term research fell , upon whose shoulders does the Secretary of State intend that that financing should fall ?
		87. I thank my hon Friend for that reply Does he agree that the placing of a child on the " at risk " register inevitably becomes known and puts its parents in an invidious position if the placing on the register has been inaccurate or based on false information ? Will he consider issuing guidelines to social services departments to ensure that parents are adequately involved at the earliest possible stage and have an adequate chance to get their child 's name removed ?
		88. The original hope was that the A400M would replace the C-130 and C-160 aircraft , and its initial brief was to operate in many configurations , including cargo transport , troop transport , medevac , aerial refuelling and electronic surveillance . Given today 's reports that the German Government intend to pull out of the consortium because of cost and delivery overruns , how does the Secretary of State respond to the charge that this programme has become a show horse for experimental new technologies , which has led to it being exorbitantly expensive , utterly unreliable and lamentably late ?
		89. I am very grateful to the Minister . My constituent Jonathan Hunt has been seeking his daughter ’s return for three years since she was abducted to Mexico , although the country is a signatory to The Hague convention , which requires the determination of cases involving minors within six weeks . What more can the Minister do to help Lydia , and how can he tackle non - compliance with the convention by member states such as Mexico ?
		90. Yesterday in the House of Commons , the Foreign Secretary admitted that he knew that when the UK and US monitors were withdrawn from Jericho , the Israelis would immediately seek to take the prisoners by force , giving the impression across the Palestinian territories of collusion . Given that yesterday the Israeli Government also reiterated their intention unilaterally to seize more Palestinian land by extending the wall , incorporating more illegal settlements into Israel and effectively annexing the Jericho valley , what are the British Government doing now to re - establish their shattered reputation as an honest broker between Israel and the Palestinian Authority ?
		91. When the SDSR finally arrives , it must incorporate three promises : the Prime Minister ’s promise during the general election campaign that there will be no cuts whatsoever in the regular forces ; the promise that the Prime Minister made shortly after the last election that there will be real growth in defence spending ; and the promise recently reiterated by the Secretary of State about the 1 % increase in real terms in defence equipment spending from now onwards . Given those three commitments—leaving aside for a moment the 2 % commitment to NATO—where will the Secretary of State find any cash at all to save if he is asked to by the comprehensive spending review ?
		92. Two years ago , the current Secretary of State said that all six ex - Danish Merlin helicopters would be operational by 2008 , yet it now seems that they will not be available until the end of this year at the earliest . Given the widespread criticism of the Government 's failure to provide sufficient helicopters , how does the Minister justify yet another 12-month delay in a critical programme ?
		93. The Government take great credit for the fact that unemployment has fallen month by month over the past 12 months , but in my constituency it has risen month by month in the past 12 months . More than 5,000 manufacturing jobs have gone in Opto Electronics . How does putting a tax on national insurance help in an area that suffers from high unemployment and wants more jobs , when a tax on income may well have helped my area ?
		94. Earlier , when the Minister was talking about asylum entry to this country , he referred to an unacceptable state of limbo , which he is seeking to exclude from the process . Will he consider the unacceptable state of limbo of constituents of mine such as Reg Stephens—there are many thousands like him—who came to this country from Zimbabwe down an entirely accepted route of entry , but has been unable to access travel documents to go back to Zimbabwe to bury a relative and really needs the system sorting out ? Will the Minister assure me that he will address that as a matter of urgency because many people are suffering under the current alleged review ?
		95. Compassionate care goes right through from surgeons to GPs . Will my right hon Friend comment on evidence that epileptic women of child - bearing age are not being shown the compassion necessary during pregnancy from their GPs or neurologists and are not having the risks of taking their epilepsy medication outlined to them ? To date , such medication has caused more than 20,000 birth defects .
		96. Is the Minister aware that Judge Tumim has reported that , for example , about 80 per cent . of inmates in Styal prison were routinely involved in the taking of illegal drugs ? What have been the results so far from the introduction of mandatory drug testing in prisons ? He has already mentioned some ideas , but what further measures will he consider to try to stem this tide of illegal drugs in our prisons ?
		97. May I encourage the Government to retain the city challenge programme ? Even if the precise expenditure under the programme in future years can not at this stage be determined , will my right hon and learned Friend confirm that the Government intend to build on the achievements of city challenge in mobilising the varied resources of inner - city communities in a new and constructive spirit of partnership ?
		98. The Minister will be aware that land adjoining roads and railways can be an important refuge for wildlife . He will also be aware of the slash and burn clearances undertaken by transport authorities in many parts of the country . Does he share my concern about that approach , and what representations will he be making about it , especially to Network Rail ?
		99. I thank my hon Friend for that answer . What we do not understand , at least on this side of the House , is that if the BBC takes a position in ITV Digital and continues with the most successful website in the world , those activities will cover the whole of broadcasting in broadband , so why should the governors retain a specific interest on their own ? Surely , we want a level playing field and Ofcom should provide it .
		100. Following the question of the hon Member for Swansea , East ( Mr. Anderson ) , may I ask my hon Friend whether he is aware that there is an enterprise zone in my constituency and a port just a few miles down the road , called Immingham ? Will he be making representations to my right hon and learned Friend the Chancellor in the event that he has something interesting to say on the matter in his Budget speech ?

	100 sample questions that were assigned type 4 (136834 total questions with this type) :
		1. Clearly , the situation in Kyrgyzstan remains difficult , but does the Minister agree that it is vital that we have maximum co - operation between the Organisation for Security and Co - operation in Europe , the United Nations and the European Union ?
		2. Have not the Government 's economic policies had disastrous effects on employment prospects , with a more than 80 per cent . increase in unemployment in Mid - Glamorgan since the Secretary of State took office ? Will he seek to restore to those areas the special development area status of which they have been deprived by the Government 's policies ?
		3. Has the Secretary of State read the recent speech of the Minister for Overseas Development calling for a radical reform of food aid policy in the Common Market ? If so , does he agree with the principles involved and will he seek to extend them to the disposal of commercial surpluses , which are a major part of the costs of the CAP which he has just mentioned ?
		4. Does my right hon Friend agree that the new United States Administration—whoever eventually wins—should take full account of both Russian and European concerns before taking any decision on national missile defence , and that they should pay heed to the report by our own Select Committee on Foreign Affairs ?
		5. Will the Secretary of State take a close personal interest in the proposed changes to the NHS in Trafford ? Given the uncertainty about alternative accident and emergency provision , and indeed the delays in commissioning community services , will he ensure that any final decisions are deferred so that they can be considered as part of the wider review planned for NHS services across Greater Manchester ?
		6. How can the Prime Minister justify his Government 's spending £ 500 million of taxpayers ' money in fees to private consultants when , as is revealed in today 's Financial Times , only £ 10 million was gained as a result ?
		7. How will the Prime Minister 's respect agenda help my constituents in Wakefield who live on estates near problem families ? Does he agree that talk of sacking so - called underperforming police officers , as some hon Members have suggested , does nothing to boost police morale in west Yorkshire ?
		8. I recently visited two weekend schools where the culture , religion and language of the ethnic minority concerned are taught out of school time . Is that not a most commendable practice ?
		9. While it is important to improve the quality and training of CPS staff , does my right hon and learned Friend agree that it is necessary that they make the right decisions ? In Leicestershire and in my constituency of Loughborough in particular , a number of cases against local drug dealers have been lost . Everybody on the estate knew who they were , the police put enormous cases together and we were all confident that we could get a prosecution , but the local CPS plea - bargained and got those people off with only a light fine . It is necessary to improve the quality of the service that is provided . Will my right hon and learned Friend give an assurance that that will be done to ensure that local people benefit from decent prosecution and that people who deserve to be put away are put away ?
		10. There are many areas in Calderdale that are suffering as a result of this Government ’s cuts . Will the Minister meet me and a delegation from Calderdale council to listen to our concerns about the funding shortfalls and look at ways to address the problems , to the benefit of the people of Halifax ?
		11. My hon Friend and the House will be aware that only 23,000 out of 4.4 million British citizens living abroad are registered to vote . This is a huge disfranchisement of British citizens . Can my hon Friend say any more about the committee that may be set up as a result of discussions in the other place on the Electoral Registration and Administration Bill ?
		12. Does my right hon Friend agree that , since the signing of the Good Friday agreement , there have been significant troop reductions in Northern Ireland , the closure of more than 40 security installations and the highest economic growth in the UK ? Is not that a powerful argument for persisting with the peace process and encouraging all parties to press ahead with the full implementation of the agreement ?
		13. Will my hon Friend take this opportunity to be a little less modest about his efforts in opening up the European telecommunications services market ? Is it not the case that his Department has made some headway in getting other PTTs to agree that Mercury , for example , should have access to markets ? Will he bring us up to date on where he sees that telecommunications development going ?
		14. The Prime Minister will be aware of the horrendous crash on the A49 in my constituency last Monday in which lives were lost and the fireball was so large that houses nearby caught fire . Will he please look into what can be done to prevent such loss of life to my constituents in the future ?
		15. More and more younger donors are choosing to make their charitable donations by text , yet this group of people are being woefully failed in terms of Gift Aid . Will the Minister look into this , so that Gift Aid support is available for donors who give by text ?
		16. Having heard all that , I wonder whether the Minister can now explain why there has been such a delay in the publication of the rural White Paper , which we expected to appear this month ? Does she recall that , although the last Government produced a large number of warm words and a lot of pretty pictures in their rural White Paper , its publication coincided with a disastrous deterioration in the rural economy and in rural facilities , including the schools to which she has referred ? Can she guarantee that her White Paper will not only represent joined - up government , but genuinely face the problems involved in regenerating the rural economy ?
		17. Is the Minister aware of the level of youth unemployment in some areas of Wales ? For example , in some parts of Gwynedd it is more than 33 per cent . among under-25s . What initiatives are his Department pursuing to deal with that terrible problem ?
		18. Has the right hon Lady had the chance today to consider the dangerous effect on the freedom of the press of yesterday 's House of Lords ruling in the case of British Steel Corporation v. Granada Television ? Does she accept that , as no journalist can reveal his sources , all journalists are now in danger of imprisonment for contempt of court ? Will she consider introducing legislation in the next Session to overrule this sad and sinister decision ?
		19. I am sure that my hon Friend will agree that the British public have been responding generously to the disasters emergency appeal . Is he able to estimate , either today or at an early date , how much our own Government have contributed to overcome the disaster , and how much has come from the British public in answer to the appeals ?
		20. I thank my right hon Friend for that most encouraging reply . Will he undertake to commend to his ministerial colleagues the considerable advantages of privatisation ?
		21. Is it correct that the employment level in Scotland rose to a record level in the last financial quarter—even higher than the UK average ? Does that not demonstrate that the Government ’s long - term economic plan is working across the United Kingdom and especially in Scotland ?
		22. When the right hon Gentleman next meets the CBI , will he discuss with it his intentions about the stagnation of the construction industry , bearing in mind that thousands of craftsmen are at present unemployed ? Will he further tell the CBI how he stands in relation to the proposed closure of the skillcentres and annexes which are vital for training people for the future ?
		23. Is it not the case that it Parliament takes a decision , as it rightly did , to move the balance from direct to indirect taxation , theatre tickets have to take their place in the priorities ?
		24. Is the Minister aware that Southend is a superb centre of tourism which he would do well to visit as soon as he can ? Is he aware that some areas of high unemployment are included in travel - to - work areas of low unemployment , with the result that no funding can be provided for their special problems ? Will he have a look at the unfair effects thereby created for some superb seaside towns such as Southend - on - Sea ?
		25. Does my hon Friend agree that one tragedy for the homeless is that there are more empty units of accommodation than there are people seeking homes ? There are more than 10,000 empty council houses in five Labour London boroughs and there is much empty property in the private sector . Some empty property—not a great deal—is owned by the Government . Will my hon Friend look at this problem sector by sector so that we can bring these valuable units of accommodation back into use ?
		26. There has been no movement in Northern Ireland on an enterprise zone . Will the Secretary of State consider helping Belfast international airport to achieve an enterprise zone in my constituency ?
		27. Although my constituents accept the need to tackle Labour 's legacy , many of them have large families and are concerned about the changes in child benefit . Will the Minister consider transitional arrangements to help families to adjust ?
		28. I thank the Secretary of State for that reply . What role does deprivation play in reaching a local government finance settlement with individual councils , such as Blackpool , where deprivation is very high ? Will the Secretary of State reassure me that those councils are not disproportionately penalised in reaching that settlement ?
		29. Is the Minister aware of recent statements by trade union and Church leaders about the appallingly high level of unemployment in Northern Ireland ? What positive steps do the Government have it in mind to take substantially to reduce the unemployment figures in the Province ?
		30. Can the Minister give us a firm assurance that the Government 's proposals in the Green Paper will not be allowed to result in any reduction in real terms of the totality of expenditure on cash benefits for disabled children and their families ?
		31. Will the Minister follow up her comment about irresponsible decisions by estimating how many of those new homes will be built on natural floodplains ?
		32. The Solicitor - General will be aware that in the year up to September 2012 , 1,243 sex offences resulted in a caution . Does he agree that it would be helpful to know a lot more about those cases , and to look at how they might impact on the conviction rates and how those offences are dealt with ?
		33. I commend my right hon Friend for the tremendous political drive that he has put behind the new deal for young people , which should prove an excellent model for our European partners . On flexible labour markets , does he agree that those have nothing to do with macho management , hire and fire and screwing down the wages and working conditions of the work force , and everything to do with superb management , recognising the unique contribution that labour has to make to productivity and the quality of the product and proper investment in training and development of staff ?
		34. As the Secretary of State said earlier that the Government were in no case to do anything , presumably in the context of the nuclear industry , will he confirm , or deny , that the South of Scotland Electricity Board has been withdrawing staff from other plants to put them into Torness to hasten commissioning of the reactor ? In view of the Chernobyl incident and the fact that , once commissioned , the plant will at some stage have to be decommissioned , with all that that entails in relation to the production of nuclear waste , and in view of current oil prices , would it not be better to bring Inverkip out of mothballs and keep Torness in mothballs ?
		35. Is my hon Friend aware that , despite the minimal administrative costs , the ratepayers of Peterborough were saved almost £ 100,000 last week by the enactment of the law ? Is he further aware that Conservative councillors in Peterborough have advocated that reduction for some time ? Without them , the reduction would not have been approved by the council last week . Even then , some Labour concillors wanted to vote to flout the law .
		36. Does the Minister agree that manufacturing industry is the only source of non - inflationary , sustainable economic growth ? Bearing in mind that the Secretary of State for Wales said that manufacturing " will play an important role in bringing us out of recession"—[ Official Report , 26 November 2008 ; Vol . 483 , c. 710 . ] what are the current Government and the First Minister in Wales doing to help manufacturing industry at this time ?
		37. At a time when some commentators outside the House doubt the utility of UK military force , it is crucial that those from all parts of the House again put on the record our respect for the remarkable contribution that our men and women are making in Afghanistan . Let me return to the question of my hon Friend the Member for Feltham and Heston ( Seema Malhotra ) , on which the Minister attempted an answer but did not give enough details . Will he say to the House in more detail what he understands to be the current commitment for UK equipment being retained in Afghanistan post-2014 ? When will the Government be in a position to share with the House the precise number of UK military personnel who will remain in theatre post-2014 ?
		38. Following the Budget 's cynical smash - and - grab raid on private pensions , what provision have the Government made for people who will now wish to opt back into the state earnings - related pension scheme ?
		39. We welcome the right hon Lady 's admission that the common agricultural policy needs to be reformed . Is she prepared to go further and agree with the Edinburgh Evening News that " The Common Agricultural Policy is a fraud that makes Enron look like peanuts " ? Although there is clearly a case for reform , is not it essential that if plans go ahead for a 5 per cent . or so cut in cereal prices , safeguards need to be in place to prevent honest vulnerable farmers in the United Kingdom , in particular in Scotland and the north of England , from going out of business ? Will she suggest to the Prime Minister that , in the negotiations that lie ahead , instead of trying to court popularity on the world stage , he for once stands up for Britain , our rural way of life and the Scottish farmer ?
		40. I am grateful to my right hon Friend for her statement . Clearly , there is grave concern in the Jewish community which is fuelled by the growth of anti - Semitic statements such as those that she mentioned and the attacks on synagogues in Moscow and the far east in May , including , most recently , the appalling attempted murder last week of Mr. Kaimonarsky , the director of the Jewish cultural centre in Moscow . Although the Russian Government promise that they will take action , very little appears to have happened on the ground . When Mr. Igor Ivanov , the Russian Foreign Minister , comes to London tomorrow for a two - day visit , will my right hon Friend raise with him our concerns about the extremely worrying lack of action and find out whether something practical can be done to deal with the problem ?
		41. Is the Secretary of State aware that the British train building industry hangs in the balance following the decision to appoint Siemens as the preferred bidder for the Thameslink contract ? Unless it is reversed , it will cost the Exchequer more than £ 100 million in lost tax revenue . Derby does not need a task force , we need a reversal of the decision . Will he give a commitment to make representations to the Transport Secretary and the Prime Minister to call in the decision , to protect thousands of jobs and stand up for British industry ?
		42. While we welcome the encouraging peace developments in the Paris treaty , we would all accept that that is in the worst economic circumstances for manufacturing industry , in particular engineering . If the Government can subsidise consultancies for companies under the enterprise initiative , which is paid for by taxpayers , why are they so resistant to setting up an agency to tackle the conversion from arms manufacture to peacetime and civil industry ?
		43. After speaking to local authorities , I can tell the Minister that it is clear that , due to Government incompetence , the extra costs are £ 30 to collect an old fridge , £ 30 to store it and at least £ 10 a fridge for bulk delivery to a recycler—that is , when they start to operate . For 3 million fridges a year , that is an unnecessary and unbudgeted cost of more than £ 200 million . On 14 January , the Minister said : " We are . . . taking the realistic view that if extra duties are imposed"— on local authorities— " they should be reasonably funded . That is the Government 's policy."—[ Official Report , 14 January 2002 ; Vol . 378 , c. 125 . ] Will the Minister confirm that central Government will pay that £ 200 million ? When will local authorities get the bulk of that money ?
		44. Is the Minister aware that the Director General of the Prison Service and senior members of his staff appeared before the Public Accounts Committee yesterday and confirmed what we have known for some time : that Prison Service finances are in complete chaos ? Is not the Home Secretary 's announcement earlier this week that he is seeking alternatives to imprisonment for fine defaulters—interesting though that proposal may be—a reflection of that chaos and of the growing problem of offenders continually entering the prison system ? Is the Home Secretary 's announcement an indication that he is going soft on crime ?
		45. Does my right hon Friend welcome the fact that the England team went to Auschwitz - Birkenau ahead of the tournament to bring home to people , in eastern Europe in particular , the horrors of the Nazi atrocities ? What a welcome respite that is from some of the terrible things we have heard about in Ukraine .
		46. Will my right hon Friend update the House on the progress being made on developing resistance to malaria ?
		47. The Government have rightly prioritised money for some of the most deprived people around the globe , but can my right hon Friend reassure me that the Government will also prioritise the ungoverned states in the conflict - affected areas around the world ?
		48. The Minister will be aware that the recent HMI report indicated that half the primary school lessons have been affected by the shortage of books . Is that not extremely serious , and what action has she taken since the publication of the report to rectify the matter ?
		49. Does my right hon and learned Friend agree that , besides the considerable dangers that he has outlined from the ex - Soviet states , there is also the problem of proliferation in the third world ? At least three more states have become nuclear powers in the past 10 years and several other states , including North Korea and a number of the middle eastern countries which form the market for its arms , are close to doing so . Does he further agree that , for Britain to get rid of her remaining minimum nuclear deterrent in the face of potential threats from the third world as well as the possible resuscitation of the Russian threat would be extraordinarily foolish ?
		50. Three years ago , the Prime Minister promised that borrowing would fall to £ 18 billion in 2015 . Will he confirm that the failure to get growth going means that he will now borrow £ 96 billion instead—yes or no ?
		51. I thank my hon Friend for that reply . Is he aware of the reported discussions taking place between BL and Honda for some form of capital participation , which a Honda spokesman described as comprehensive capital participation in BL ? Can my hon Friend tell us whether that is true , and if so whether he would welcome it ? If he has not done so , will he give every encouragement to that development , particularly in the light of the success of the British Aerospace venture , which has succeeded despite opposition from both the official Opposition and the unions ?
		52. Further to the answer given to the hon Member for Workington ( Mr. Campbell - Savours ) , and to set the record straight , will my right hon Friend confirm that , following its successful defence of the Scottish and Newcastle takeover , during which Matthew Brown suggested that Scottish and Newcastle might wish to close one of its breweries , the first thing that the Matthew Brown management did was to close one of its breweries ? Consequently , does my right hon Friend agree that small is not necessarily secure ? Does he further agree with the general principle that it is better to have a large domestic industry that is able to compete with European companies than a fragmented industry that can not do so ?
		53. I am grateful to the Minister for that reply . In border constituencies such as mine , many constituents - such as those who live in Sedbury and Beachley in my constituency , whose nearest town is Chepstow in Wales - will be very concerned about how this plan would work across borders . In May 2008 Ministers said in the forerunner to this document that they were thinking very carefully about how it would work across devolved borders , so can the Minister give us any idea about any proposals he has come up with - or has the last year and half just passed with no concrete action at all ?
		54. The right hon Gentleman may be aware that many NHS non - executives fear that they are being attacked by the Secretary of State . There is a large number of outstanding appointments . The system was essentially endorsed after exhaustive examination by Lord Nolan . If the right hon Gentleman discusses the matter with his noble Friends Baronesses Dean , Jay and Hayman—and many others in this place who served on trusts—he will discover that they are very worried that he will exceed the actions of one of his predecessors who vindictively dismissed 150 appointees when he came to power . Will the right hon Gentleman state that he has no intention of attacking those NHS non - executives who have done so much for the health service ?
		55. Is it not the case that the privatisation programme is proceeding apace throughout the world , that Socialist Sweden has returned 15 companies with a total turnover of £ 100 million to the private sector , and that only the Albanian - style Labour party is kicking against this trend ?
		56. As Mr. Chernenko is to visit this country soon , will my right hon Friend give him a message to take back to the Soviet Union—that we want peace , but not at any price ; that if the Soviets dismantle their nuclear missiles we will dismantle ours ; and that the British people are not naive ?
		57. Is my hon Friend aware that East Anglia is one of the fastest growing regions of the country and consequently has been experiencing great pressure on its road system ? Is he aware in particular that the Al2 , which passes through my constituency and links the east coast towns of Felixstowe and Ispwich with London , the M25 and the Dartford tunnel , is in urgent need of a third lane in each direction and the completion of the central safety crash barrier ? Will my hon Friend give sympathetic consideration to these possibilities ?
		58. My hon Friend probably knows that I am a lay member of the General Medical Council . Does she agree that it is not in the patient 's interest , the public interest or the profession 's interests if doctors work incompetently and inappropriately ?
		59. I am sure I will not be the only Member of the House to have been dismayed by the Secretary of State ’s last answer . Yet again the Government seem to think they know better than the Royal British Legion and service personnel on this matter . Service families want justice done in the open for loved ones killed in action . Why will he not listen to their rejection of the secret inquests he has proposed in the justice and security Green Paper , or will he answer again that the Government know best ?
		60. Does the Minister agree that the major economic impact of 1992 on Northern Ireland will be the five - year strategic plan funded by the EEC , which is already the subject of detailed discussions between the Government and the authorities in Brussels ? When do the Government intend to let the Northern Ireland public and local interests know about the specific projects contained in that plan , so that there can be proper and thorough public discussion and consultation ?
		61. Will the Prime Minister find time to take a personal interest in the question of issuing free disposable syringes to diabetics ? Does she agree that it would be morally wrong to deny disposable syringes to those who have no choice but to inject themselves daily for the rest of their lives when she is able to find the resources to make disposable syringes available for drug addicts so as to prevent AIDS ?
		62. Does my hon and learned Friend agree that the Government 's policy of shifting tax from direct to indirect taxation is the best way to catch those who try to avoid their tax commitments ?
		63. Does my hon Friend agree that it will not assist the wage earner and the entrepreneur if the Chancellor decides to take into tax private pension schemes , which will discriminate against those who want to protect their families and , furthermore , not allow them to be a burden on the state ? Moreover , will my hon Friend deny the rumours that he intends to do that ?
		64. Will my hon Friend accept the thanks of all of us for the care that he is taking with regard to the upgrading of the A 1 and the careful planning of the M 1-M62 motorway ? Will he take into account the fears expressed by the hon Member for Normanton ( Mr. O'Brien ) for the communities beside the road ? Those fears are becoming increasingly important .
		65. Is the Minister aware of the regular inconvenience caused to passengers on the west coast main line by the unserviceability of the escalators connecting the main line station at Euston to the London underground ? On one day last month , underground trains on the Victoria line did not stop at Euston because there were so many escalators out of action . When London Underground suffers problems with escalators , they are out of action not just for weeks but for months . Will the right hon Gentleman have a severe word with representatives of London Underground , tell them that they have to do better and report to the House that they are going to do better ?
		66. One of the proposals to reduce benefit dependency made at the fag end of the Tory Government was to restrict housing benefit for single claimants under 60 who rented in the private sector by denying them the right to exclusive use of a bathroom , a toilet or a kitchen . Does my right hon Friend agree that that proposal was a disgrace , treating benefit claimants as second - class citizens ? May we have an assurance that it will not figure in the proposals made by our Government ?
		67. In May 1997 , there were 1,826 people unemployed in Wellingborough ; at the end of last month , that figure had risen to 3,366—an increase of 84 per cent . Whose fault is that : is it ( a ) the last Conservative Government ; ( b ) the previous US President ; or ( c ) the Prime Minister who claimed he had ended boom and bust ?
		68. Is my hon Friend aware that there is great scope for the use of private contract services in many of the activities undertaken by the British Airports Authority ? Will he consider issuing a circular—as my hon Friend the Minister for Health has done to health authorities—urging the use of private enterprise wherever possible ?
		69. Will the Secretary of State and his team listen to those of us , on both sides of the House , who believe that if we can persuade more of our European partners to switch to the B variant , it will provide a perfect example of how European nations can stand together ?
		70. I thank my right hon Friend for that reply . One of the seven trusts that he mentioned is at my local club , Enfield Town , which has also elected a supporter - director to the board . The chairman recently called the trust unrepresentative , which I believe reflects its growing influence . Does my right hon Friend agree that such a structure should be spread throughout sport ? If he does , what measures will he take to publicise it further ?
		71. On Sunday , a constituent aged over 80 came to see me . He said that he was now receiving his 25p pension supplement , which he saw as a gross insult . It does not even buy a pint of milk . When is the Chancellor going to sort that out ?
		72. I hope that the Minister will reflect on the incorrect statement that he has just made . Small firms are fed up with the loose words and empty promises of Ministers . Let me take the Minister back to six years ago , when the Government introduced regulatory reform orders . We were told then that they would reverse the regulatory tide , but what happened ? In six years , Ministers have issued just 33 reform orders and enacted 18,000 more regulations . That is the truth about the effects of RROs . Given the dismal record of Ministers and their colleagues , may I ask the Minister for regulatory reform one straightforward question ? How many regulations has his department scrapped in the last 12 months ?
		73. Can my hon Friend confirm , however , that with the huge and welcome expansion in the number of students , the best way to cope with the difficulties in the long term is not to return to the widespread availability of benefits for students , but to do what almost every country in the developed world does—ensure that the majority of students go from home to local universities ?
		74. Can the Secretary of State put into context the changes in taxation ? Basic rate taxpayers in Northern Ireland have had their personal allowance increase , which has taken many of them out of the tax net .
		75. Although I welcome the Government ’s intervention on fuel bills , many rural people do not benefit from mains gas and have to depend on more expensive fuels . Will the Government investigate how they can benefit off - grid customers , who often live in fuel poverty ?
		76. It is great that a Labour Government whom I support and a Parliament in which I serve has acted decisively to put the rights of victims at the heart of the criminal justice system . How confident can my hon and learned Friend be , however , that the component parts of the criminal justice system now have sufficiently robust systems in place to assure victims of the exercise of their rights ? In respect of the Crown Prosecution Service in particular , is she satisfied that there is adequate guidance and training for members of staff to enable them to carry out their duties to the best of their abilities ?
		77. In addition to the thrift argument , does my right hon Friend agree that too rigid an application of the present capital regulation leads to a host of unpleasant circumstances in individual families ?
		78. The Secretary of State has described his cuts as progressive , fair and protecting the most vulnerable . Last Friday , Conservative - led Birmingham city council inflicted the biggest cut in local government history of £ 212 million . Some 4,000 people face losing their care packages , including some of the most vulnerable , many of whom are in ill health and in the twilight of their years . Is that progressive , fair and protecting the most vulnerable ?
		79. At his party conference , the Prime Minister promised that , if re - elected , he would cut income tax by £ 7 billion . That money has got to come from somewhere , so just how big an increase in VAT has he got in mind this time ?
		80. Is the Chancellor aware that since 2010 unemployment in my constituency is down by a staggering 1,000 ? What assessment has he made of the role of small business start - ups in reducing unemployment ?
		81. General practices in Winsford are being underfunded by 3.6 % in terms of the formula that should apply to them because of the slow rate of change , while nearby Merseyside practices are being overfunded by 5 % . That is resulting in a £ 30 million loss to my local surgeries . Will the Minister commit himself to looking into it and introducing a quicker rate of change , so that local residents can benefit from the funds that they should be receiving ?
		82. Does my hon Friend agree also that it is essential to restore confidence in Lloyd 's by putting an end to the present shambolic atmosphere of leaks , rows and scandals ? Does he agree also that probably the best and quickest way to do that is to follow the apparent advice of the governor of the Bank of England and to appoint an independent chief executive of Lloyd 's who would do the job of regulation which the present chairman and committee are so manifestly failing to do ?
		83. Is Northern Ireland getting its fair share of health resources from the central Exchequer to look after health services ? Has my hon Friend had a chance to compare the amount of money from the central Exchequer given to health services in Northern Ireland with the amount given in the south , and to discover whether there is a flow of people from the south trying to take advantage of any difference ?
		84. Is not it scandalous that this Government should talk about this one isolated incident when the same lousy , rotten Government have thrown more than 1 million people out of their jobs in less than two years ? Why does not the Minister attack those employers , such as the one at Roakes bridge near Preston—in respect of which a motion will be placed on the Order Paper signed by many Members of Parliament—where 50 people have lost the right to work because of some tinpot , rotten employer who will not allow them to become members of a trade union ? Why does not the hon and learned Gentleman get on his high horse about that ?
		85. I thank my hon Friend for that reply . Does he agree that , although integrated schooling is not a solution to the deep divisions in Northern Ireland society , it plays a crucial role in heightening understanding and tolerance of different cultures and religions ? Will he say whether the Northern Ireland Office is taking any steps to encourage existing schools to transform themselves into integrated schools ?
		86. I should be pleased if the Minister could tell us what conversations on recruitment and retention she has had with the Royal College of Nursing since July , and what tangible progress has been made . Although some of us were interested to hear the Secretary of State say—rightly—that under - capacity is holding back development of the NHS , the president of the Royal College of Surgeons recently said that it would take 10 years before those problems were properly and adequately dealt with . Will it take 10 years before we get the recruitment and retention of nurses right ?
		87. I welcome the Minister ’s reply . I also declare an interest : I am in the process of buying a Nissan Leaf to show my support for Nissan ’s welcome investment in electric vehicles and indeed in other vehicles . Will the Minister explain how he is looking to support small businesses investing in electric vehicles for their staff and their businesses ?
		88. Does not the right hon Gentleman accept that those figures are now very menacing ? Is he prepared to introduce any new urgent measures to halt the runaway rise in unemployment ? Given that we have already lost 7,000 steel jobs this year , does the right hon Gentleman accept that fierce resentment was experienced in my constituency when it was discovered that another 1,000 steel jobs were to go at BSC Shotton ? What will he do in order to pump new jobs into my stricken area ?
		89. I understand that about £ 1 billion goes unclaimed in pension credit . Oxfordshire Age Concern , which covers both the Secretary of State 's constituency and mine , tells me that much of its work is now in helping pensioners to claim the credit and fill in the paperwork . Will the Minister consider further ways of helping pensioners to access the benefits to which they are entitled ? Age Concern and other charities have been very good at reaching pensioners whom even home visits have not reached , so will he consider giving them a grant - in - aid , so that they can be more active in ensuring that pensioners get all the benefits to which they are entitled ?
		90. Given that the impetus for the Convention was , to a great extent , the enlargement process , does the Minister agree that the accession states should have not just full rights of participation at the Convention and the intergovernmental conference , but full and equal voting rights at the IGC ? Would that not reassure those countries greatly , especially after the hollowness of a common European foreign policy has been made so obvious by the disgraceful and patronising attack on them by President Chirac ?
		91. Does my right hon Friend believe that the BBC should have a public service remit to cover women 's sport ? In the licence fee changes that may be made after 2006 , will she ensure that the right of women 's sport to equal coverage is printed and published in the BBC 's public service remit ?
		92. Will my hon Friend reconsider his reply and emphasise much more significantly the importance of providing local courts for the convenience of local witnesses and local parties ? The insistence on a certain number of sittings is a criterion which ignores the factor of convenience to the public .
		93. Does my hon Friend agree that the best way to encourage the rejuvination of inner cities such as London is to withdraw Government directives that force county councils such as Berkshire to build 8,000 additional houses in central Berkshire that are not wanted by the local people ?
		94. Does the Minister agree that there is no better way than sport to combine social inclusion , healthy living and increased aspirations ? If he does , does he also agree that we need even more flagship community sports projects , particularly in coalfield communities ?
		95. Has my hon Friend had any success with exploring the terms of memoranda of understanding within NATO countries , which at the moment are apparently preventing the sale of some technology , not to countries of the Warsaw Pact but to free world countries outside that bloc which might want to buy technology but at the moment are prevented from doing so ?
		96. I thank the Minister for that ingenious reply , but the Financial Times last week said of the new systems that in the north , planned implementation has not happened and in the south , the contractor has been fired , and that hospital bosses generally believe that the project is near to death . Which bit of " not working " does the Minister not understand ? Is it not time for a review ?
		97. I am sure the Minister will join me in paying particular tribute to David Masters , the Wiltshire coroner , who is doing an outstanding job wrestling with the complexities of the inquest into the deaths of the 10 people killed when a Hercules came down in Iraq . Can the Minister confirm that in no circumstances will he or anybody else in the Ministry of Defence attempt to interfere with the investigations or with the outcome of any such inquests , even if those inquests were to be critical of Ministers or of the MOD ?
		98. Why is today a public holiday in Barbados , the Philippines , Benin , Vanuatu , Upper Volta , Yugoslavia and the People 's Democratic Republic of Yemen , while it is not in the Thatcher undemocratic satellite of Scotland ? Is it significant that the Prime Minister 's governor - general of Scotland has the same name as the patron saint of England , especially when , according to some historians , St. George was a purely mythical figure who did not even exist ?
		99. I am grateful to my hon Friend for that answer , which is very encouraging . It shows up some of the protestations from the Opposition , especially bearing in mind that there are fewer than 20 Labour Back Benchers in the Chamber for employment questions . Does my hon Friend agree that one of the important aspects of creating jobs is the creation of employment opportunities within areas ? Is he aware that Derbyshire county council levies the highest shire county rate , and does he agree that that is a great disincentive to the creation of jobs in the county ?
		100. The news that the defence budget is balanced is obviously very welcome , but there will inevitably be a certain amount of scepticism about it . Does my right hon Friend accept that if he is to dispel that scepticism , the sooner he can provide absolute clarity about exactly how he has balanced the budget , and exactly how the £ 38 billion black hole that Defence Ministers referred to is calculated , the better ?

	100 sample questions that were assigned type 5 (1746 total questions with this type) :
		1. I see that a certain loyal junior Minister has been trying to use the constitutional debate as an alibi for the latest of the Government 's economic failures in Scotland . Does the Secretary of State accept that the Scottish constitutional convention is expressing the positive aspirations of the people of Scotland in a way in which this minority Administration never can and never will ? Can we have a bit less of the Secretary of State 's ministerial whingeing and will he face up to the clear demand from the people of Scotland for home rule within the United Kingdom ?
		2. May I ask the Minister to do something very practical ? We are grateful that she launched the report , but will she ensure that every single police and crime commissioner and every single chief constable gets a copy of it so that they can not only reduce crime by cutting down dysfunction in the population early on in life , but save the taxpayer a lot of money through not having to invest money late on through late intervention ?
		3. We are talking about smoke and mirrors , and funding of political parties . Does my right hon Friend think that we could be told how Conrad Black got his peerage ? Can we be reassured that the reason was nothing so grubby as to involve money ? There is no logic as to why even the Conservative party would have asked that man . He does not attend the House of Lords—he soon will not be able to do so—and was not a national of this country , so I want to know why he was preferred over and above the many thousands of Conservative party activists .
		4. How can the Secretary of State deny responsibility for London 's housing problems or those of the country as a whole when the Government have deliberately and systematically cut local authority housing investment programmes by more than 70 per cent . in real terms during their period in office ? Does the Minister agree with his right hon Friend the Member for Henley ( Mr. Heseltine ) , who , in addressing himself to this problem , said that he was far from persuaded that building more and more houses which fewer and fewer of our children could afford to buy would solve the problem of homelessness ?
		5. There is , indeed , a significant interest . I am glad that the Backbench Business Committee has been able to schedule a debate on the FairFuelUK campaign ’s petition later this month , and I look forward to a debate now that our campaign for financial education in schools has reached 100,000 signatures on the e - petitions site . Given that petitioners will naturally expect to secure a debate once they reach that threshold , will my hon Friend keep under review the amount of time that is allotted to the Committee this year ?
		6. Does my hon and learned Friend agree that the level of fines imposed on people caught salmon poaching is by and large ludicrously low ? Will he take steps to consult his colleagues with a view to having the fines greatly increased ?
		7. May I tell the Prime Minister that sadly my constituent better known as Boomer , Port Vale football club ’s beloved mascot , had a stroke last week ? He was discharged home only to be told that he could face an eight - week wait for urgent speech and language therapy . Can the Prime Minister set out how the Government will ensure that there are community stroke specialists and speech and language teams giving the right community care support from day one , in both Stoke - on - Trent and the rest of England ?
		8. Just as he has on Turkey , the Foreign Secretary has U - turned in his opinion of President - elect Trump . Given the openly racist and Islamophobic opinions expressed by some of Trump ’s Cabinet nominees , does the Foreign Secretary maintain his belief that there is a lot to be positive about in the new Administration , and how does he intend to work with his new counterpart to uphold universal human rights such as racial and gender equality ?
		9. Can the Minister expand on his comments in today 's Official Report concerning the 4 deg west line for mackeral quota and the lack of flexibility around it ? Why is the Minister so encouraged by the results of the Council of Ministers meeting , when the report contains only a postponement until the end of May ?
		10. Whether the expenditure savings will be great or small , and given the point made by the hon Member for Rutland and Melton ( Mr. Latham ) , will the Secretary of State ensure that financial considerations will in no circumstances impair the operational efficiency of the security forces ? Will the Government give the highest possible priority to the elimination of terrorism , which must be a prerequisite for any form of political process ?
		11. I thank the Minister for his response . The latest figures from the UN , from early this month , show that there have been 400 demolitions since the start of the year , more than four times the rate of demolitions last year . The wave of demolitions is depriving Palestinians of their homes and their livelihoods and preventing European taxpayer - funded organisations from providing essential humanitarian support . As the British Government made representations when demolitions trebled , what more effective action or sanction will the Minister impose now that demolitions have quadrupled ?
		12. Can I urge the Minister to look carefully at the impact that any spending reductions in the nuclear sector would have on our supply chain in West Cumbria ? Ahead of the spending review , will she press the Chancellor on the need to support our local supply chain through the ongoing decommissioning at Sellafield , alongside the nuclear new build at Moorside ?
		13. Is the Prime Minister aware that , to many , the miners ' dispute seems to be going from bad to worse ? We have all viewed scenes that bring fear to those of us who believe in democracy . Can the Prime Minister , from her great office of state , think of any initiative that could be taken to prevent this desperate dispute going on into the winter months ?
		14. I thank my right hon Friend for his welcome reply . May I clarify with him the position of British citizens who are already bringing cases to the Strasbourg Court and are thereby locking themselves into a lengthy and expensive procedure ? Will British citizens be able to transfer their cases into the British legal system when the incorporation of the European convention on human rights into our law is complete ?
		15. Is the hon Gentleman aware that , following the massacre on 19 April of 24 people by El Salvadorean security forces , the American Senate Foreign Relations Committee recommended that no further American aid should be provided to El Salvador until improvements had been made in human rights ? Unless America impresses on the Government of El Salvador the point that it must not practise terrorism , will not all of its declarations against terrorism throughout the world fail to ring true ?
		16. The Solicitor - General is laughing at his own reply . Does he really maintain that position ? Surely the change is cosmetic . All the offences would have been recorded as breaches of the peace and would have been prosecuted in exactly the same way . It is brass - necked to suggest that the provision represents some contribution to better government and law enforcement in Scotland .
		17. Are some people who are in receipt of child support allowance missing out on income support ? I have a letter sent on behalf of the chief executive of Jobcentre Plus . It shows that the change that came in on 12 April means that : " As the children will not be included in the calculation for Income Support , any income they receive , including maintenance payments , will not be taken into consideration " . That is being countermanded by local provision . The Chesterfield manager states that it is misleading because maintenance payments are made not to the children but to the parent . Can the matter be clarified ? Are some people missing out on income support because they are on Child Support Agency money ?
		18. In view of the fact that we all read and listen to the Chief Secretary with reverential attention , can the Prime Minister say clearly whether increases in wages are a cause of inflation or not ?
		19. Picking up a point made by my hon Friend the Member for Macclesfield ( Sir Nicholas Winterton ) , who has pinched yet another question of mine - the problem is that we both come from the same stable - may I reiterate that approximately 200,000 people living in rural England do not have access to broadband facilities ? Would that not aid financial inclusion as it provides access to valuable information , online banking , credit union services and other such services ?
		20. I welcome my right hon Friend to the Dispatch Box in his important new responsibilities and the Government 's business friendly initiative announced on 19 September . Has my right hon Friend yet found time to read European Commission regulation 3223/94 , which , if implemented , would impose an extra 50p on a litre of fresh orange juice sold in this country , costing an estimated 1,000 jobs ? In addition , a quarter of our abattoirs would be put out of business by similar regulations—
		21. Does the Minister agree with his colleague the Minister of State , Ministry of Justice , the right hon Member for Bermondsey and Old Southwark ( Simon Hughes ) , that the Government ’s cuts to legal aid are “ unarguably harsh ” ? Will the Minister correct his own overestimate of the earnings of legal aid lawyers , which the UK Statistics Authority yesterday called “ potentially misleading ” ? Is it not time that the Ministry of Justice ministerial team put themselves in order ?
		22. What assurances will the Under - Secretary give the House that BSC will not be required to raise its prices , as a result of these complaints , to such a level that it will lose its own traditional markets ?
		23. Given that since the Prime Minister took office we have lost 250,000 manufacturing jobs out of a total of 750,000 jobs that have been lost and that 30,000 firms have gone bankrupt , can the Minister say upon what basis British industry can expand and tackle the balance of payments crisis ? Can the Minister tell us about any point in a post - war recession at which at the depth of that recession we did not have a balance of payments surplus ? What is the difference this time ?
		24. Does the Minister recall that we on these Benches have advocated provision for tax vouchers for child care in the past three Finance Bills ? Does he recognise that provision is required for local authorities , voluntary groups and the private sector to provide places in creches and nursery schools ? Will he take steps to ensure that that is possible following the Budget ?
		25. Would the Chancellor just confirm that the veto on the other two members of the OBR will function in exactly the same way as it would for the chairman ? Would he also confirm that , in line with our recommendations , the OBR will be permitted at the request of Opposition parties at election time to examine their fiscal policies as well ?
		26. Is the Minister aware that the real education picture , as shown in the HMI report , is one of shortages of teachers , inadequate curriculums , not enough books and materials , and an increasingly urgent need for repairs to school buildings ? Does he agree , as the local education authorities told the Secretary of State , that the situation will only be made worse by the level of RSG settlement for 1984–85 and by the Bill published today to take away the ability of LEAs to charge rates as they think fit ? How will the Government Actuary 's report , which is published today , on the increase in teacher pension contributions affect the financial position of LEAs ?
		27. Can the Secretary of State indicate what proportion of recent incidents relate to cross - border activities ? Does he agree that , instead of hon Members indulging in generalised attacks on the Government of the Republic , they should bring forward specific instances of lack of co - operation if that is what they want rectified ?
		28. Can my hon Friend confirm that the JET scheme is inefficient and costly , but it is close to the heart of the Opposition ? Perhaps it is an example of yet another new danger . Has my hon Friend looked at other schemes in other parts of the world ?
		29. Many Conservative Members have long believed that lower - paid workers should be moved out of paying income tax . Will the Chancellor confirm that next month ’s increase in personal allowances will have a real benefit for hard - working families in Broxtowe , and can they be increased even more come the Budget , please ?
		30. The Secretary of State will be aware of the tremendous stress caused by the process to young doctors , who have been through a long period of training at great public expense and want to contribute to the health care of the entire community . I have met groups in my constituency who are very stressed by it and worried about the future . Can she offer any assurance as to how many of those junior doctors , who have completed a long period of training and worked very hard , will be unemployed at the end of the process ? To me , the idea of unemployed doctors , when there is such enormous health need , is unthinkable .
		31. Will the Secretary of State be able to give us a definite idea that the decision will be announced before Christmas ? Once that decision is made , will we be able to vote on it in the House ?
		32. I applauded the Secretary of State ’s announcement , back in 2010 , that the Government would cease the practice of gold - plating European Union regulations , but the vast majority of businesses in this country would like to see him take a more backward - looking stance and review the 13 years of gold - plating that took place under the previous Administration . Can the business community rely on the support of the Secretary of State in that regard ?
		33. Do not the figures released yesterday show an average increase over Scotland of 9·1 per cent . , with many authorities showing increases of more than 15 per cent ? In the light of that , how will the Government maintain the fiction to pensioners , ambulance men and others that the rise in the cost of living is 6·5 per cent ?
		34. Can my right hon and learned Friend give an assurance that the money that has been invested in the banks will not be at the expense of investment in public services ? People such as pensioners , parents with children in schools , patients of the NHS and public sector workers will be concerned that the money that we have invested to rescue the country from the excesses of the masters of the universe must not come at the expense of those services . Can she give that assurance ?
		35. May I remind the Secretary of State that not all Britain 's transport problems are in London ? One clear way to reduce congestion is through the use of mass transit and light rail networks . Can the right hon Gentleman cite even one instance in which the Department has offered concrete , solid financial assistance to any of the proposed light rail systems ? When will Birmingham get the benefit of the electrified north - south route that he announced during the Mid - Staffordshire by - election ?
		36. Will the Prime Minister confirm that if the link with pensions had not been broken in 1980 the single pension would now be £ 5·95 extra and the married pension would be £ 9·40 higher ? While it is impossible to give an increased pension to every person , irrespective of their income , the Government policy ought to be—like the SDP - Liberal alliance policy—to restore the link for all those pensioners who have no other source of income .
		37. The Minister must be aware that the cuts undertaken by the Government have lacerated research in tropical development institutions and core funding of research institutes such as the institute of development studies at Sussex . Since December it has been clear that the whole future of the school of development studies at East Anglia is at risk . The Minister made a good start at this by expressing concern over the matter , but why has he not followed it through ? Can he not get the Department of Education and Science to grant funding , and if he can not , will he not come up with something from his own budget as a temporary measure to ensure that that school can survive ?
		38. I thank the hon Gentleman , although he has a very short memory ; he knows that I was " there " because I asked him a question only three minutes ago . With regard to Question 38 , the hon Gentleman will be aware that English Heritage was spending something like £ 10 million on restoring the fabric of English cathedrals only a few years ago . That sum has reduced to just £ 2 million . Can he use his best offices to ensure that cathedrals such as Lichfield 's and others get the required money , because not just church - goers , but the whole community benefit from our great cathedrals ?
		39. Has my right hon Friend had an opportunity to read the diaries of Sir Charles Greville , which show that when he retired as Clerk to the Privy Council in 1860 , 29 people were employed there . They have increased by 6 per cent . , while in the same period the numbers employed at the Home Office have increased from 39 to 36,446 — an increase of 93,351 per cent ? Does my right hon Friend agree that that shows that the taxpayers are given value for money in at least one Department of State , because it is not increasing its functions unduly , and does he further agree that some credit should go to successive Clerks to the Privy Council ?
		40. I welcome that positive statement and I recognise the Minister 's personal interest in these matters . Can the hon and learned Gentleman advise the House whether he has had the opportunity to discuss , and possibly to implement , specific projects that would assist the three states economically , socially or educationally until such time as the western world recognises their obvious independence ?
		41. Can my hon Friend confirm that the pattern of GCSE results is similar to that of A - level results in grant - maintained schools , and does she agree that the excellent results from grant - maintained schools vindicate the wide diversity of parents who choose GM schools for their children ?
		42. On the day that Howard Hunt , who organised the Watergate break - in , has died , will the Prime Minister confirm that if a close aide is charged , he will leave office ?
		43. Are there not still many restrictive practices in the professions , and is it not wholly desirable that they should be subjected to objective scrutiny to ascertain whether they are operating in the public interest ? Will my hon Friend confirm that nothing is to be regarded as sacrosanct ? Does he agree that a good professional does not need the protection of a closed shop and that the only criterion that the Government should use is the interests of the customer ?
		44. I am grateful to my hon Friend for that reply , but given the invaluable contribution that carers make to our society and the billions of pounds that they save the taxpayer , could we not do more ? Will my hon Friend consider taking specific steps to ease the financial burden on carers , specifically to ensure that carer 's credit and carer 's allowance are equivalent to the national minimum wage and that carer 's allowance can be claimed in conjunction with the state retirement pension ?
		45. I understand that , to strengthen the coalition , there may be a reshuffle on Monday . How does that work ? Does the Deputy Prime Minister have specific posts that he appoints , such as the post of Secretary of State for Business , Innovation and Skills ? Can he appoint only Liberal Democrats to those posts , or can he approach other Members ? If so , does he have my mobile telephone number ?
		46. I have concerns about the effect of the Secretary of State 's proposals for GP commissioning on services in rural areas and urban areas such as mine . Greater Manchester PCT provided strategic leadership in the recent reconfiguration of children 's services , which was very contentious . Can the Minister clarify how that strategic leadership will be provided in the future reconfiguration of cancer , maternity and ambulance services in Greater Manchester , as GP commissioning will be focused on local health needs and national commissioning on national specialities ?
		47. Can part of the £ 20 million made annually by the British Airports Authority on duty - free whisky sales be used to provide double glazing for people who live under the noise shadow at Heathrow and other airports ?
		48. Does the right hon Gentleman accept that the reply given by his right hon Friend on 18 March , and the replies given this afternoon about the White Paper , still mean that in reality a large portion of police files will be left completely independent and exclusive of any inspection system , even on behalf of the public ? Will he therefore have a look at the suggestion that has been made by myself and other hon Members , that if public access can not be permitted to these police files—indeed , there are good reasons for that—some kind of independent inspection on behalf of the public should be undertaken ?
		49. As someone who worked in the public services before my election here , I well understand the pressure put on public servants to cover up bad news . I was contacted by a nurse yesterday who informed me that concerns that were raised at a training day were dismissed by a matron—people were told to put them in the bin . Can the Secretary of State assure us that he will do everything to ensure that nurses who are concerned about staffing levels feel free to speak out and will be protected ?
		50. I thank my hon Friend for his reply . Will he confirm that in Nottingham , East , which covers a large part of the inner city of Nottingham , unemployment has fallen by 13 per cent . in the past year ? Can he quantify the rise in unfilled job vacancies that have been registered ?
		51. Can I bring the Minister back to the real world in relation to regeneration ? The Government are about to announce a £ 3.75 million English Estates project for Templeborough in Rotherham , which I support . It is estimated that the project will create 175 jobs . Last year , 2,939 coal , engineering and steel jobs were lost in Rotherham and , in November , 260 jobs were lost at Templeborough steel plant . Only last week , 75 jobs were lost at Brinsworth strip mill . The loss of 400 jobs is being negotiated in United Engineering Steels in Sheffield and Rotherham . The regeneration project is a flea on a dog 's back compared with the number of jobs that are being lost in that area . When will the Government meet those job needs , instead of proposing these developments , where less than 20 per cent . of jobs are replaced through regeneration ?
		52. In relation to international development and the money that goes to the Caribbean countries , illegal trade in children from Haiti to the Dominican Republic has taken place and has been very apparent in the news in the last while . Can we use our influence to ensure that the money available through international development goes to stop that trade ?
		53. The Minister has today laid before the House a pensions written ministerial statement that intimates that following a year - long Labour campaign the Government intend to ensure that pension fund managers in the City disclose the fees that they charge for trading all of our pension assets . That is welcome , but of course the devil will be in the detail . On that basis , can he confirm today that that disclosure will include the number of times that fund managers churn our pension assets for a fee ?
		54. When will repairs to junction 8 by Hemel Hempstead be completed ? At present , they are causing great chaos . Once we have dealt with junction 8 , can we look forward to a period of no repairs on the M1 between Bedfordshire and London for a reasonable space of time ?
		55. Will my hon Friend underline the point that , whether it is benefits or budgets , the role of the Audit Commission has been significantly enhanced by the National Health Service and Community Care Act ? Will he ensure that the Department gives every possible support to the work of the Audit Commission , which does its best to ensure the best value for money for patients from the much - enhanced sums that we are now spending on the health service ?
		56. In the interests of improving the harmony of those bilateral relations , does the Minister agree with the statement by his counterpart , Condoleezza Rice , that Britain 's involvement in the Iraq war increased—I repeat , increased—the threat of terrorist action here ?
		57. Can the Secretary of State advise me whether the Atomic Weapons Establishment is carrying out live nuclear work at Burghfield and what safety issues were raised by the nuclear installations inspectorate ?
		58. I entirely endorse what the Secretary of State has just said and accept that there has been real and commendable progress since the Select Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs produced its report on organised crime last July , but is it not still very disturbing that , clearly , a number of former paramilitaries are involved , are intimidating people and are taking part in crimes such as fuel smuggling in particular ?
		59. Will the Solicitor - General confirm that in rivers and lochs , while they are in the water , fish do not belong to anyone , but , once caught , they become the property of the angler who catches them , irrespective of whether he owns the fishing rights or has received permission to fish ? Will he join me in encouraging anglers to enjoy their favourite sport free from the fear of prosecution , harassment and intimidation by water bailiffs and game keepers ? Will he support my call for a democratically constituted Scottish anglers trust to regulate and administer all freshwater fishing rights in Scotland ?
		60. Can the House be assured that the CPS takes seriously the issue of domestic violence ? Is it understood in the service that successful prosecutions for domestic violence today could save lives tomorrow ?
		61. Is the Minister not concerned that 24 per cent . of those planned inspections will fail to take place this term ? Does he agree with the comments made by the former chief inspector of schools that the main problem was the requirement that every contract for inspection has to go out to competitive tender ? Does he agree that it is yet another example of his Government putting political dogma before the interests of the nation 's children ?
		62. I welcome the Minister to his new position . Given the high figure of people aged 16 to 24 who are out of work , and in particular given that the number of people in that age group who are economically inactive and not in full - time education has increased by 144,000 since 1997 , does he still maintain the position that the current Prime Minister advocated in 2005 , that youth unemployment has been virtually abolished ?
		63. Is it not the case that there is no provision for compensation payments for the purchasers of private property around the proposed sites for the dumping of low - level nuclear waste ? Will the Minister state what additional costs would be required for such provision ?
		64. In view of the forecasts of higher rate increased in some counties , will my right hon Friend name any factors that he thinks would justify such higher increases ?
		65. Why was the report 12 months late ? Why does it fail to close the loophole that allowed Abu Hamza to transfer a £ 200,000 property to his son ? Can the House have any confidence that the new asset - freezing unit that was announced will be any more effective than the dismally unsuccessful Assets Recovery Agency , which was shut down after it cost £ 60 million to set up and collected only £ 8 million in assets from criminals ?
		66. Is not it the truth that CTCs have emerged only as a result of the lavish use of taxpayers ' money to prop them up ? Will the Secretary of State accept that in Bradford , the capital expenditure on one CTC is roughly the equivalent of the whole of the capital expenditure for one year awarded by the Government , but Bradford public schools are in dire need of expenditure ? Is not it true that the Government 's attitude towards CTCs is private affluence and , towards the rest of the education system , public squalor ?
		67. Can the monetarist experiment be continued in an effort to reduce the rate of inflation below 10 per cent . without a further intolerable rise in the numbers of unemployed ?
		68. Measures to tackle predatory loan sharks are obviously welcome across the political spectrum , but will the Chancellor tell the House why average levels of household indebtedness are so much higher in Britain than in almost all our European neighbours ?
		69. No one doubts the Minister ’s personal commitment to sport , but what assessment has he made of the extent to which opportunities for women , and indeed everybody else , to take part in grass - roots sport will be hugely reduced because sports staff are being made redundant and fees to hire facilities and entry charges to pools , sports halls and leisure centres are being increased ? That is a result of cuts to local council budgets that are going too far and too fast , for which both he and the hon Member for East Dunbartonshire ( Jo Swinson ) voted .
		70. Is my hon Friend surprised and disappointed that there has been an increase in petrol consumption in the past year ? He mentioned signs of a reversal of that trend . Can he amplify that ?
		71. Will the Secretary of State clarify , with the additional deployment , how many UK troops will serve in Iraq ? Will he confirm that they are working not just with the Kurdistan Regional Government and in Baghdad but with the very varied ethnic groups in Iraq whose support is essential to a successful coalition effort ?
		72. If all taxpayer liabilities against RBS and Lloyds are taken into account , the current loss is more like £ 20 billion , rather than the £ 11 billion claimed by United Kingdom Financial Investments Ltd. In that context , can the Chancellor of the Exchequer give the House an assurance that there will be no early sale of these assets - before the general election , say ?
		73. Does my right hon Friend accept that a number of my constituents who have suffered because of the reprehensible activities of squatters will welcome the answer that he has given me today ? Many of my constituents can not understand why—despite the complexities of this aspect of law—the law can not be brought into line with that governing a prime residence . Can the Minister advise me when he might be able to make an announcement on this matter ?
		74. I welcome the Minister 's statement . His heart is in the right place , but steelworkers in my constituency are concerned at reports that some in Whitehall want substantially to offshore the building of Her Majesty 's ships . Can I be assured that the steel of our new generation of royal naval ships will be built in Britain , that we will avoid the procurement boom and bust policies of the Conservative party , and that we will have a sustained programme of building royal naval vessels which keeps the bulk of the work in the United Kingdom ? If the vessels are to sail under Her Majesty 's flag , they should be built on Her Majesty 's territory .
		75. The Army Prosecuting Authority dropped a case against British soldiers , despite lots of evidence having been on worldwide TV , saying that it had happened more than six months before . It claimed in its press release that the same applied to the civil authorities . Can the Solicitor - General confirm that if a thug beats someone up and lies low for six months , he will not be prosecuted despite the evidence ? Is that the law , or has the Army Prosecuting Authority got it wrong ?
		76. Whether the House is for or against the EEC—I am certainly against it—can the Secretary of State tell me exactly what the Government are doing to protect Ferranti , bearing in mind the predators within and outside this country who intend to take it over and asset strip it ? That means that jobs will go and a major asset will be reduced to ruins both north and south of the border . Are the Government doing anything about that ? Will the Government act as a guarantor for British industry or will they just sit back and listen ?
		77. Can the Minister confirm that using Woolwich will not leave any lasting legacy and will be very expensive ? That might be excusable if there were no alternative , but does she accept that there is a perfectly viable alternative at Bisley ? It has world - class facilities , it is quite near London , it would offer far better value for money and a small capital investment there would leave a lasting legacy .
		78. Will the Attorney - General confirm that it was only because of his inability to prosecute Wright in this country that fruitless and expensive actions in Australia and New Zealand were commenced ? Would the advice be the same if the need arose in the future for the same kind of action to be commenced in foreign jurisdictions ? Was it because of , or in spite of , the Law Officers ' advice that the Wright case was continued right to the bitter end ? Once the issue of principle was lost in Australia , why was there the need to continue to try to gag the British press right up to the House of Lords ? Is it not time for proper and independent machinery to be set up to supervise the security services—machinery in which we can have confidence—to ensure that , whatever actions Wright and his colleagues took , such an incident will never be repeated ?
		79. Last week the Prime Minister said there was no question of cutting the size of the Army . That answer , as he must know , was quite wrong . Will he now correct it ?
		80. Can the Minister confirm that future stop - and - search policy will be based entirely on operational policing requirements and priorities ? Does she agree that at a time when the Government were stepping up measures against terrorist threats , it was wrong of her and other Ministers to criticise the police for recent stop - and - search statistics ?
		81. How can the Minister and the Secretary of State possibly justify cutting proportionately three times as many Welsh MPs as English MPs , creating monster constituencies in rural Wales and geographically impossible ones in Welsh valleys ? Instead of ramming through those changes , why will not the Government maintain the existing system of public inquiries that has protected local interests for generations ?
		82. Is my hon Friend aware that the House will applaud the initiative that he has taken to seek to cut away unnecessary bureaucracy and red tape , which are indeed a burden on business ? What further action does he propose ? Will he bear in mind the increase—some of us would say regrettable increase — in Common Market regulations ?
		83. The Chancellor attended the IMF conference at the weekend . Can he share with us what our international partners are saying about the coalition Government 's efforts to deal with the deficit ?
		84. The Minister has had the advantage of listening to the chairmen and chairwomen of the police authorities of England and Wales at the Belfast conference last week . Can she identify a single one of them who supported the Government 's restructuring policy ?
		85. Is the Minister aware that at the start of the next school term there will be 1,260 more children at school in Rotherham , but some 112 fewer teachers because of the cuts imposed by his Government ? Can he convey to the Secretary of State for Education the great distress of the parents and teachers of Rotherham at the decline in the three Rs in that borough and suggest to the Secretary of State that the new three Rs are reshuffle , resignation—his own—and right now ?
		86. When confronted with the realities of probation overstretch in the case of Daniel Sonnex last week , the Secretary of State claimed that there had been a net increase in the number of probation officers over the previous five years . Will he admit , however , that that figure relies largely on the massive increase in the numbers of probation service officers , who are qualified to a lesser degree and can not supervise high - risk offenders ? Will he confirm that the number of qualified probation officers actually fell over the same period ?
		87. I find myself in alarming agreement with the hon Member for Cardiff , West ( Kevin Brennan ) in underlining the simple fact that there is a great difference between an inability to meet a commitment and a patent unwillingness to do so . Can I implore the Minister , in a cross - party spirit , to underline at every turn the Government 's intention to compel those who can pay to do so ? It is unacceptable that large companies should deprive people of legitimate entitlements that were built up over a long period , and on the strength of which their expectations for their retirement are based .
		88. Will the Minister confirm that since the regulations were introduced , £ 10 million of public funds have been wasted on the policy and 3.25 million hens have been slaughtered , while in the same period outbreaks of this strain of salmonella have increased by 82 per cent ? Does the Minister agree that he did not listen to the advice of the Agriculture Select Committee , endorsed by the Opposition , when it told him that the policy would not work ? What does he intend to do about the increasing level of salmonella food poisoning in Britain ?
		89. The village of St. Margaret 's in my constituency is working hard to become a low - carbon community . Can the Secretary of State assure us that the funding for the challenge scheme will continue , and will he join me in paying a visit to St. Margaret 's to see the excellent work the community is doing ?
		90. I welcome the Secretary of State 's recognition of Mr. Gladstone 's fiscal prudence , which is , of course , a typically Liberal characteristic , and I draw the Secretary of State 's attention to Mr. Gladstone 's favouring of devolution all round . Instead of speculating about taxation in future , will the right hon Gentleman give a factual account of how much increased revenue he and his Government have raised in Scotland as a result of taxation increases since the last general election ?
		91. I recall enthusiasm being expressed in the past for retiring members of Her Majesty ’s armed forces being recruited as teachers . Can the Secretary of State indicate how many people retiring from Her Majesty ’s armed forces have become teachers ?
		92. I thank my hon Friend for his reply . The paper is eagerly awaited throughout the country . Is my hon Friend aware that youth workers in Corby play an important and effective role in working in the community with the young people who experience the greatest problems—young people with problems related to drug abuse , young people who are perpetrators and victims of crime and young people who have left school with no qualifications ? The youth service plays a critical role in helping those young people to return to the community . Will my hon Friend devote all his energies and ability to giving the service new purpose and new leadership , so that it continues to be open to all young people and can target its resources and expertise on those who are most disadvantaged and most alienated from their communities ?
		93. The pupil premium is an excellent coalition policy to assist children from disadvantaged backgrounds , as is the free school policy . Can the Minister advise us on what efforts he will make to push forward with the free school policy to target areas with a high proportion of students on the pupil premium ?
		94. Although I am aware of some notable contributions by the heritage lottery fund—notably for the Botticelli in Edinburgh—there has been some unpredictability in the fairly recent past . Will the Secretary of State join me in welcoming the decision of the heritage lottery fund in making so firm an announcement ?
		95. I thank my right hon Friend for that reply . Can she give the House an assurance that this Government will not become like the previous Government , who were transfixed and immobilised , on the question of decommissioning in the peace process ? Surely the deaths of Rosemary Nelson and Frank Curry underline the fact that 1,000 silent guns and 1 tonne of Semtex buried and not used are not a problem when there are people who are willing to use one gunshot and 1 lb of explosive , which can derail us unless we face the issue . Can my right hon Friend give the House an assurance that , having missed the deadline of 10 March , she will call a meeting of the Assembly on 29 March and will set up the Executive in Northern Ireland ?
		96. Once the German elections have passed , are there any plans for serious discussion of what will happen when new member states begin to make demands on the CAP pool ?
		97. First , may I thank the right hon Lady for not blaming everything on the previous incarnation ? Obviously that would be an unfashionable thing to do at the moment . Can she confirm or deny reports broadcast yesterday that all leave for the armed forces is to be cancelled , as a precautionary measure , during the new year period ? Is that true or false ?
		98. Do not the figures that my hon Friend has given indicate that , far from cutting the railways , the Government have increased support from the level of £ 485 million under a Labour Government to £ 819 million under this Government ? Will my hon Friend take the opportunity to remind the Opposition that the railway mileage was cut far more dramatically under the last Labour Government than it ever was under a Conservative Government ?
		99. Can the Under - Secretary inform the House how many commissioned officers in the forces are of African , Caribbean or Asian origin ? Why are people of that origin in the British Army assumed to lack merit , aptitude and motivation , because there are so few of them in the commissiond ranks ? Does the hon Gentleman accept that many people in the minority communities will not feel that they are fully accepted as British citizens until they are given a commensurate place in the protection of these islands , on merit , aptitude and motivation , and not on the ground of discrimination , from which many feel they suffer ?
		100. Does the Minister recall the passage in the Commonwealth communiqué which says that dialogue in the UN - sponsored talks—the intercommunal talks—is the only means by which progress can be made to a peaceful solution ? Will he confirm that that at least was one area about which the Prime Minister did not dissent or write a separate document ? Will he urge the Turks to use whatever leverage they have with the Turkish Cypriots to end any stalemate , urge them to come to the table on the basis of the United Nations talks and impose no preconditions ?

	100 sample questions that were assigned type 6 (5901 total questions with this type) :
		1. Does my hon Friend agree that these jobs in the sunrise industries , which are of immense importance both to employment and to the modernising of British industry , could be at risk if doubts grew about the intention of this country to remain in the European Community , as the main reason for investing here would be gone ?
		2. On a specific point , given the good reputation of the five education and library boards for promoting co - operation across the community boundaries , can the Secretary of State assure the House that consideration has been given to whether the proposal to reduce the number of boards to four—for financial reasons , as I understand it—will not have the disadvantage of making the boards far more segregated and far less able to do the very good job that they have done in the past ?
		3. That Committee 's visit to Dounreay brought some sanity to a situation in which Dounreay has been the victim of sensationalist and technically ignorant journalism . Given the huge resources of skill on the north coast of Scotland , how can the Government do without the plant in tackling their own targets for carbon dioxide reductions ?
		4. Three weeks ago the Prime Minister told me : " It is worth pointing out the fact that , when we finally won the conflict in Iraq , some of the people who were still offering resistance were extremists from Chechnya."—[ Official Report , 18 June 2003 ; Vol . 407 , c. 355 . ] Invited to support that fact with evidence in a written answer , the Foreign Office could not do so other than by reference to unsubstantiated reports . We do know , however , that none of the captives in Guantanamo bay is Chechen , although nine are British , and that British forces did not encounter any Chechens in Iraq or in Afghanistan . Should the British Prime Minister be prepared to blacken the name of an entire people on the basis of unsubstantiated reports ; and will he withdraw that statement unless and until he has evidence to support it ?
		5. Is my right hon Friend aware of the number of people in Scotland who work for the Ministry of Defence , the Department for Work and Pensions and the Treasury ? How safe and secure are those jobs in the short , medium and long term ?
		6. Is my hon Friend satisfied that all British service men who may have been affected by radiation from those tests are aware of the survey and are being offered the opportunity to present their own medical evidence ?
		7. Will my right hon Friend agree that one of the things that could act as a major impediment to any upturn in industrial activity is high industrial energy costs ? Will he accept that there is ample evidence that the hoped - for benefits from the Budget are not getting through to many major energy users in industry ? Will he look at the question again ?
		8. Will Ministers join me in congratulating the National Theatre on 50 years at the very heart of our cultural and artistic life ? It is a great reminder of the sheer quality of the excellence of our national arts institutions , many of which are based in the capital . Outside London , however , the picture is now very different . I pay tribute to those who have produced a report today showing the massive disparity in Government and lottery support for the arts . What the Under - Secretary of State for Culture , Media and Sport , the hon Member for Maidstone and The Weald ( Mrs Grant ) said earlier is wholly wrong ; whereas Londoners get £ 70 per head each year the rest of the country gets only £ 4.60 per head . So what are the Government going to do to rebalance our cultural economy ?
		9. Will the Minister look at the case of my constituent Albert Dowie , whose small service pension is preventing him from doing part - time work , because to do so would deny him income support and reduce his housing benefit ?
		10. Will not many new jobs be created by the establishment of the national lottery headquarters ? When making recommendations about the relevant criteria , will my right hon Friend be able to suggest that they entirely exclude the constituencies of Members such as the hon Member for North Cornwall ( Mr. Tyler ) , who asked the question and is a member of a party which was against the idea ? Also , will he consider including Eastbourne in the list of potential sites ?
		11. Does the Minister accept that those who work in the firms that are threatened have a real reason for being irritated when they see their jobs put under stress in this way , and at the same time read of the increased grain trade between the United States and the Soviet Union ? Will the hon and learned Gentleman put the greatest possible pressure on the United States Government to try to moderate their policy in this respect , and also give a guarantee that if , unfortunately , firms such as John Brown and a number of others in Britain suffer as a result of that policy , they will be financially compensated by the British Government ?
		12. May I thank the Justice Secretary for the kind words that he recently said about me to the Magistrates Association ? May I also refer him to the representations that the association has made on this issue ? Will his hon Friend the Minister go so far as to admit that the Magistrates Association still has concerns about fixed penalty notices being imposed for first time offences , about fines going unpaid— [ Interruption ] —she should feel free to answer for herself , rather than conferring—and about community sentences not being completed ? Does he or she therefore share my concern that there should be a court—
		13. How can the Secretary of State boast to the House and to other European countries about Britain 's unemployment record when , over the past five years , 11 million people have been unemployed at one time or another ? Is not the Tory party the party of high unemployment ? Why does he continue to oppose a national minimum wage when he has now taken to saying that he cares about the low paid ? Is he prepared to justify the fact that one third of a million people in this country are on £ 1.50 an hour or less ? How can he justify the fact that more than 1 million people are on less than £ 2.50 an hour ? Does not his opposition to the social chapter have nothing to do with the interests or concerns about British people at work but everything to do with the splits in his party ?
		14. British civilians working for both the Government and , as my hon Friend the Member for Birmingham , Edgbaston ( Ms Stuart ) stressed , non - governmental organisations have played a crucial role in helping the ordinary people of Afghanistan , especially women , to improve their lot and have a better future , which is why they are targeted by the despicable Taliban . So what are the Government doing to ensure their safety , not only now , but especially after the military draw - down ?
		15. If the Minister is in touch with the care providers , what response does he intend to make to the now almost universal call , particularly from charities , for an urgent review of benefit rates in this year—1989—to avert an otherwise threatened financial collapse ? Does he realise that many people , particularly the most dependent elderly people , are very fearful about the difficulty that they face in meeting the gap between rising costs and static benefit rates ? Is the Minister aware that in many cases their children are also pensioners and can not help them ? When do the Government intend to do something about that ?
		16. The Secretary of State complained about figures being 20 years out of date . What sort of figures can they possibly be for the year 2020 ? He is using figures that could be said to be more than 20 years out of date . When he produced those estimates , what figures did he include for women having to work beyond 60 before receiving the old age pension ? That is where many of the savings come from .
		17. My right hon Friend knows the importance attached to the equalities and human rights provisions of the Good Friday agreement by those of us who tabled amendments to the legislation , which were eventually accepted . My right hon Friend has to deal with many difficult issues , but is she able to give the House any idea of any plans in progress to implement the equalities and human rights provisions and , in particular , to set up the two commissions ?
		18. Will my hon Friend take this opportunity to welcome the recent appointment of the drugs tsar , who will help in the overall co - ordination of Government policy on the prevention of substance abuse ? On solvent abuse in particular , which is the topic of the Act , will my hon Friend ensure that there is greater education and stronger enforcement of the Act ? In particular , will he ensure that the dangers of butane gas abuse , which has killed nearly 40 young people this year alone , are brought to the attention of the community at large ?
		19. Does the Minister realise that , due to the stockpiling of coal and the Government 's general attitude to the mining industry , there is fear in the industry that in the near future the Government will be on a collision course with it ? Why do we not have more investment ? Why can not we have greater utilisation of coal ? Why can not we do something about the fluidised - bed system , which would bring coal to the fore ?
		20. From where does Babcock and Wilcox buy its steel—from Ravenscraig , or from somewhere else ?
		21. Will my right hon Friend note the warm welcome that has been given in the Vale of Glamorgan to the announcement by the Welsh Office that grant aid is likely to be available for an improved road link between Culverhouse Cross and Cardiff Wales ? Will he join me in urging the highway authority , South Glamorgan county council , to take up that offer of help ? Is any grant aid likely to be available for the rail link to which my right hon Friend alluded ?
		22. In the Secretary of State ’s target operating model for probation there is welcome mention of restorative justice . Can he say anything more to ensure that awareness of restorative justice across the system is so embedded that it becomes an option to be considered on all occasions , particularly to deliver much - improved victim support as well as the rehabilitative effect it has already demonstrated ?
		23. I recognise the need to retain local democracy , but will my right hon Friend consider imposing an absolute ceiling on rates increases , thereby ensuring that the hard - pressed ratepayers of Labour - controlled authorities do not have to suffer increased hardship ?
		24. Does my hon Friend accept that the public sector route has a vital role to play in rebuilding our national health service , and that we should not rely on private finance initiatives alone ? On that basis , may I thank him and the rest of the team for financing the £ 9.5 million Loughborough hospital , which will start work this summer and is financed solely by the public sector ? Will my hon Friend visit that site , along with the Opposition spokesperson , the hon Member for Woodspring ( Dr. Fox ) , who visited it recently , to see Labour delivering its health promises ?
		25. If the Scarman tribunal makes specific recommendations regarding what the question calls policing methods in conditions of potential racial friction " , can we be certain that the Home Secretary will see that police forces inside and outside the metropolis accept those recommendations , and will he provide the resources to make sure that they can be carried out ?
		26. Will my right hon Friend agree that , for most developing countries , access to the markets of the industrial world is , in general , much more important than official aid ? Does she agree that there is a fundamental paradox in the position of many Opposition Members who urge increased aid and also loudly advocate protectionism ?
		27. Is the Prime Minister aware that people in my constituency of Blyth Valley eagerly await the RECHAR money ? As there is a split in his Cabinet will he get off his backside , stop swanning around that desert island and have the money paid ?
		28. Will the improved administration plans for the Department include more training for judges , including senior judges , particularly after the most unfortunate decision made in the Maxwell case , which undermined the meticulous preparatory work of the Serious Fraud Office ?
		29. Can the Under - Secretary adduce any evidence , in relation to pensioners or anyone else , for the Secretary of State 's assertion a little while ago at the Dispatch Box that the previous Administration thought that anyone who claimed benefit was a scrounger ? Does he not think that , if we are to have a sensible debate on welfare reform , we need a more mature approach than was demonstrated by the Secretary of State ?
		30. Thank you , Mr. Speaker . [ Hon Members : " Hear , hear . " ] I love you ! I too have received correspondence from constituents—Mr . Stuart Little and Mr. Murray Pakes , who trained and invested many hours in becoming domestic energy assessors and home inspectors . They are now disillusioned and completely demotivated by the Government 's broken promises to them . What should I tell them about reclaiming their costs ? Can they sue the Government , or shall I tell them that they will have to lose that money if , as is likely , they do not wish to proceed ?
		31. Surely the worst culprit in regularly financing the Provisional IRA both with cash and arms is Noraid and its organisations in the United States of America . Will the Minister therefore enlighten the House about the extent to which it is still annually financing the provisional IRA ?
		32. Has my right hon Friend noticed that of all the counties in England , Liberal and Labour - run Kent county council retains the largest share of its education budget at the centre ? How does that sit with the oft - repeated complaints from the Opposition that too much is spent by the Government on administration ?
		33. Does the Minister recall that during the last election campaign , his party promised to reduce taxation ? This year road users are paying £ 7 billion in taxes—£2½ billion more than in the last year of the Labour Government . Is the Minister aware that the average car user now pays £ 7 a week and has to put up with more congestion , more potholes , more delays and more dangers , as a direct result of the present Government 's road policy ?
		34. Will the Minister confirm that the change is part of the Government 's public expenditure cuts ? Will he remind the House and the country how much less child benefit will go to mothers in this year of the changeover ?
		35. Does the Minister accept that the real issue over the past 12 months has not been about pit closures , union rules or amnesties , but about the right way and the wrong way to run a modern industry , and about the right of management to manage ? Does my hon Friend further accept that the only way to run a successful industry , whatever it may be , is to expose it to the full blast of competition ? Does he accept that at the end of the day it is the consumer who keeps the industry in business , and not a Government ladling out money ad nauseam ? Finally , does my hon Friend accept that the only way to run a modern mining industry is to privatise it ?
		36. I thank my hon Friend for his kind remarks and for his full response . Is he aware that nothing could be more important to pensioners than for the retail prices index connection to be given high priority in the work of the Department of Employment ? As the permanent secretary to his Department suggested to the Public Accounts Committee that this work could be privatised , does my hon Friend have anything to say in that regard ?
		37. I welcome the progress that seems to be being made at European level , but does the Chancellor agree that we need to work more internationally , particularly with the Americans , to ensure that the trade talks are a success ? Can he give any indication of the timetable ? As he rightly said earlier , some 6,000 children a day are dying in Africa , and the potential uplift from just 1 per cent . growth in world trade would far outweigh all the aid programmes , the international finance facility and much else . Can we move extremely quickly , because day by day , this is an urgent problem ? Can he reassure us that even if the United States is dragging its feet , Europe can move forward ?
		38. May we have an update on the Chancellor ’s intention to introduce a new regime for annually managed expenditure ? Will the overall welfare cap of which he has spoken include a cap within a cap for welfare spending in Northern Ireland ?
		39. I have been asked to bring this case to the House on behalf of Mrs. Mayfield , who has been denied choice . She had the choice between a hospital in Wakefield or a hospital in Leeds , and the PCT directed that she should be treated in Leeds , which meant a 36-mile round trip in the ambulance provided by the PCT. Mrs. Mayfield has recently undergone tests at Clayton hospital in Wakefield and is now waiting for further treatment . If that treatment can be provided at Pinderfields hospital , will my right hon Friend assure me that Mrs. Mayfield will be able to choose the hospital in Wakefield rather than the hospital in Leeds ?
		40. Stratford - on - Avon district council is about to submit its core strategy to the Planning Inspectorate for approval . Will the Minister confirm that , after submission but before adoption , the strategy will be given weight in planning decisions and provide protection for my constituents , while delivering much - needed housing ?
		41. Can the Secretary of State tell us how planning the route for HS2 will be linked with planned improvements for east - west rail travel—for example , Liverpool to Hull ?
		42. The national Hepatitis C Trust has informed me that several patients have approached it after being either misdiagnosed by their GP or waiting an inordinate amount of time to be referred for either a biopsy or treatment . What processes exist to link patient feedback to GPs ' continuing professional development ? How will the new GP contract and appraisal system aid that activity ?
		43. I thank my right hon Friend for that reply . I very much welcome the drive to bring about better - quality regulation for the benefit of business and citizens . I am glad to hear about the success of the conference . Can my right hon Friend share with us any specific outcomes to reform European bureaucracy arising from that conference ?
		44. The Minister referred to the priority that he is giving to reform of the common agricultural policy . Will he enlighten us on the ways in which that reform could take place ? Does he acknowledge that one way would be to reduce headage payments and to spend more money on agri - environmental schemes ? Are the Government of the view that that is one way forward ?
		45. Will the Chief Secretary please tell us why his party campaigned throughout the election against immediate spending cuts , but is now , in return for jobs in the Cabinet , willing to risk tens of thousands of jobs across the country ?
		46. On that last point , I am sure that the Minister will acknowledge that one of CEOP 's great strengths is the partnerships it has created with the private sector and children 's organisations . What evidence can he give to the House , therefore , that under his proposals CEOP will continue to be able to raise about one third of its running costs from sources outside Government ?
		47. Does the right hon and learned Gentleman admit that the increased national insurance contributions will cut the living standards of those in work end , with the cuts in public expenditure , will increase the number of people out of work ? In view of forecasts that unemployment may reach 3 million some time next year and that the financial cost of unemployment will be bigger than the total public sector borrowing requirement , how much worse are things to get before the Chancellor changes course and invests more money to provide more real jobs ?
		48. I welcome the hon Member for Hartlepool ( Mr. Wright ) to his new position and look forward to debating the issues with him . Hopefully , when he has had time to reflect a little more on his brief , he will find out that although he would like to assert that the child care element of the working tax credit is a success , in fact only 20 per cent . of those eligible actually receive it . I am sure that he is finding out that his brief is very difficult in respect of child care . As the hon Member for Mid - Dorset and North Poole ( Annette Brooke ) pointed out , there are now 10,000 fewer registered child minders , and that affects summer child care . Nationwide , however , more child care places are being shut down than new places are opening . Is the new Minister taking a fresh look at why Government policy is squeezing so many trusted child care providers out of the market ? Furthermore , will he listen to the findings of the Federation of Small Businesses report , which says that another 200 nurseries could shut before the end of the year ?
		49. More than 1 million Londoners are entitled to Labour 's freedom pass and more than 11 million older and disabled people in England are entitled to Labour 's concessionary bus pass . Pass holders have been made anxious by reports in the media of the submission made to the Treasury by the Secretary of State in relation to the comprehensive spending review . The CSR is three months away , so can he reassure those anxious older and disabled citizens that he has not submitted , in his job application/CSR bid , any change in the eligibility requirements for those who receive the bus pass ?
		50. On the subject of magistrates courts , will Ministers consider seriously any proposal from magistrates that would have them hearing cases in venues other than courts so that they can continue to deliver local justice locally ?
		51. Almost 9,000 people with mental ill health in England and Wales have been in hospital for more than a year . Given that benefit cuts at that point can be demonstrated to be anti - therapeutic , and can therefore lengthen the stay in hospital , is it not right , in medical , moral and monetary terms , to push that 52 week limit even further , perhaps to something approaching two years ? The cost would not be great , the Chancellor is listening , and this is the time of year to do it .
		52. In reviewing and amending charters , the Minister placed considerable emphasis on responsiveness to public demand . On the education charter and particularly testing , given the thumbs down from teachers , the public at the polls and even education advisers to the Secretary of State for Education , will the Minister at least draw the Secretary of State 's attention to the fact that the citizens charter is meant to pay attention to other people 's views and , one hopes , will do so before the system descends into chaos ?
		53. Does my right hon Friend agree that if the BP share offer goes ahead—as Conservative Members confidently expect it to , and as the vast majority of hon Members believe it should—the taxpayer will have got an extremely good deal ? Has my right hon friend heard any criticisms from Opposition Members in the past few weeks to the effect that all that we are trying to achieve with this privatisation is to line the pockets of our friends in the City ?
		54. Although I welcome the kind words of the Minister about the community programme , will he go a little further and reassure the House that the number of places in the community programme in Scotland will not be cut next year ? The present number of places is about 16,000 and , given the unemployment situation , would it not be a disgrace if the number were to decline significantly when there are 350,000 Scots on the dole queue ?
		55. May I reassure the Minister on behalf of my hon Friend the Member for Caithness and Sutherland ( Mr. Maclennan ) that he will reply to the Minister 's question as soon as possible ? May I resume my hon Friend 's point with specific reference to Glenelg in my constituency , a socially fragile area as regards employment , as the previous Secretary of State said in the announcement to which the Minister referred in his initial answer ? Surely the handling of that raises my hon Friend 's point—that if there were more local participation in forestry some of the anxiety would , perhaps , be overcome or at least partially allayed . Instead , there have been rather dubious dealings on the possible disposal of that asset .
		56. Is the Minister aware that the English Industrial Estates Corporation has made a major contribution to the development and growth of factory premises in the Northern region ? Will he therefore ignore plans for turning that corporation over to the private sector in the way that has been suggested this afternoon ? Further , will he try to ensure that the English Industrial Estates Corporation does not operate in such a way as to stop many firms taking the premises with which they are provided because of bureaucracy and unwillingness to provide freehold premises in many instances ?
		57. Is my right hon and learned Friend aware of the considerable support given to his proposals for free ports ? As these will entail considerable nurnbers of new real jobs , can he say how soon a free port will he established in the United Kingdom ?
		58. On the housing benefit demonstration projects , what assessment has been made of potential budgeting accounts—so - called jam - jar accounts—to help people manage all their finances and build up a savings pot ?
		59. Last summer , the Government set themselves a target of a 10 per cent . fall in benefit fraud by 2002 , yet the latest departmental figures show a negligible fall , described by the Secretary of State 's own civil servants as not statistically significant . Will he reaffirm that target , or is this another case of the DSS talking tough and achieving little ?
		60. Can my right hon Friend estimate the cost of a referendum ?
		61. If we are having difficulties with the Anglo - Irish Agreement or its successor , should not we make a much more determined effort at local level ?
		62. Will the Minister enlighten the House on the Government 's policy on the export of machinery where its purchase has been grant - aided by the British taxpayer ? As he well knows , the machinery has to be used for four years only , and it is not then old , even in today 's modern technological society . Machinery whose purchase has to a large degree been contributed to by the British taxpayer is then exported to provide a competitive product from , say , South Africa . Should not the hon Gentleman be doing something about that ?
		63. I certainly thank the Minister for the last part of his reply . I share his view entirely , as I think would my constituents . However , may I ask him three questions on this issue—[HoN. MEMBERS : " No . " ] I shall do so very quickly . First , my right hon Friend referred to a 50-truck company . I would be interested—I am sure that the road haulage forum would find it helpful—to explore the position of a smaller company , including its cash flow , as a result of the change in tax status . Secondly , what is the impact on market share over the period in which the increased taxes will be introduced ? Thirdly , are there means of measuring the impact on the environment of these taxes so that we can ensure that the outcomes are those that we are seeking ?
		64. As the Minister knows , the Central line rattles through my constituency to Stratford station , and more often than not stops there . How much of the new investment is Government money as opposed to internally generated LRT money ? Furthermore , will the long - awaited and much - welcomed proposals to improve the Central line take into account the possibility of Stratford being used as the site for the second London terminal of the Channel tunnel link ?
		65. I am grateful to my hon Friend . Will he expand on a reply that he gave earlier to the hon Member for Huddersfield , East ( Mr. Sheerman ) and tell the House more about the role being played by the English Industrial Estates Corporation ? Will he tell the House what impact , if any , the changes in the Finance Act 1980 to the industrial buildings allowance have made to the availability of small units ?
		66. Does the Minister accept that the continuing uncertainty is causing great problems to universities and students ? Does he further accept that this year there is a need to determine the grant on the basis of a student needs index rather than inflation ? Furthermore , does he accept that the inconsistency between one university and another works against some students ? Is he aware that at Liverpool university costs in the halls are £ 100 more than at Hull university ?
		67. Is my right hon Friend aware how warmly welcomed his decision will be in Scotland ? However , has the Scottish Tourist Board been consulted ? What has been the procedure of sale to ensure that the sale takes place to the best advantage of Scottish tourism ?
		68. Many folk in Clacton who have disabilities and whose need is genuine have contacted me to say they are very concerned that they could lose their allowances . Can the Minister guarantee that the deficit will not be fixed on the back of vulnerable people in Clacton who genuinely need these allowances ?
		69. Does my right hon Friend agree that whenever there is an allegation of child abuse the police should be able to obtain a medical report on the child concerned so that they can decide whether to prosecute ? Does he further agree that any attempt to prevent the police from so doing is to be deplored ? Furthermore , is there not a clear case for substantially increasing the penalties available to the courts in cases of child neglect and for tightening the parole conditions on those convicted of child abuse ?
		70. On the question of Iranian sanctions , as so much American policy is now conducted by television or press leak , will my right hon Friend consider telling the House early next week whether it is true that a deadline of 11 May has been set , as is reported all over Washington today ? That is a serious matter and the House should be kept informed of how these matters are moving .
		71. I am disappointed to hear that reply . When the Prime Minister was Chancellor , he was responsible for complicating occupational pension schemes to such an extent that many of them were shut down by the trustees . On another point , will the hon and learned Gentleman explain why the unclaimed assets fund is being used only for youth projects ? None of that money is going towards helping those pensioners who suffered so much through the failure of the schemes .
		72. May we assume from the Minister ’s reply that the Government ’s policy now is to encourage contacts with countries with records on human rights as despicable as that of Equatorial Guinea , and that hon Members should accept private invitations for five - star business class visits paid for by the Governments ?
		73. Everyone knows—except probably the Minister—that the forerunner of this organisation has lost hundreds of millions of pounds . Is he aware that the so - called investigation now going on will again cost millions of pounds , mainly going to the very highly paid lawyers who come up with condemnations , but no action will be taken ? Can the Minister guarantee that some of these people will be sacked for the way in which they have milked the taxpayer of hundreds of millions of pounds ?
		74. I thank the Secretary of State for that candid answer . Will he confirm that he has no idea how many applications to join the reserves have been lost as a result of the IT fiasco over which this Government have presided , and will he explain how he plans to make potential reservists aware that their applications might not have been processed ?
		75. Will the Secretary of State accept that although rail travellers from my constituency are indeed looking forward to more reliable services after the upgrade of the west coast main line , they are also looking for better information and better integration of cross - country services to link into what I still call Intercity trains stopping at Stoke and Macclesfield ? Furthermore , is he aware that Congleton station is a positive disgrace ? It is very inhospitable , and it needs CCTV and a good paint . We need some money spent on it , rather as money is being spent on the up line at Stoke - on - Trent and the down line in the constituency of my hon and ancient Friend the Member for Macclesfield ( Sir Nicholas Winterton ) .
		76. On refugees , will my right hon Friend undertake a root and branch investigation into how the Coniston hotel in my constituency was selected by the National Asylum Support Service as a reception centre , not least given that it was only acquired today but is due to open next Monday ?
		77. Is my hon Friend aware that , up to last month , there were only seven examples of the use of video evidence in child abuse cases ? Does he agree that this form of evidence giving not only enhances the prospect of a safe conviction , but involves minimum extra trauma for the children concerned ? Will he seek to promote it , and also consider its relevance to other offences—for example , rape ?
		78. Is my hon Friend aware that part of the success of the tourist industry in Wales is down to increased quality ? May I recommend that he visit the Bluestone project in my constituency , which received £ 16 million of funding from the Welsh Assembly Government and has created 340 jobs—all local , apart from one—and 220 units of accommodation of the highest standard ? That is the future of the tourist sector in Wales . I recommend that he talk to our right hon Friend the Secretary of State , who is sitting next to him , and who has already visited .
		79. I thank my hon Friend for that reply . However , is he aware that the figures that have been published so far seem to demonstrate that police in the town of Slough work much harder than do police in the rest of the Thames valley ? Will he consider making that information more widely available by publishing how many constables are attached to each basic command unit , as well as the number of crimes that have been committed ? That would show where the police have to work hardest , and it might persuade our chief constable that he should allocate more constables to Slough .
		80. On public company gifts for scientific research , would a Treasury Minister be prepared to meet David Baldwin , chairman of Hewlett - Packard in Britain , who says that if the arrangements were more generous —as they are in the Federal Republic of Germany and the United States—his company would be prepared to give significantly more to universities such as Edinburgh , Strathclyde , Bristol and Cambridge ? Would such a meeting be possible ?
		81. As someone who uses it regularly , may I say that the condition of the Forth rail bridge is a national disgrace ? Is it not time that somebody told Railtrack to show more expedition than it has demonstrated in the years since the matter was first brought up ? Surely it is ultimately up to Ministers to do that .
		82. On the question of the opportunity that is to be given to council house tenants to buy their houses , will the right hon Lady deny the proposal made by one of her advisers that mortgage interest relief is to be disallowed for tax purposes ?
		83. As there is no evidence of which we are aware that Sir Oswald Mosley was a traitor , unlike Blunt , Maclean , Philby and Burgess , why do we have this incredibly long period before the truth can come out ?
		84. I am grateful to my right hon Friend for that reply , but sadly I was unable to hear his earlier answer . Can I assume that in his answer he was able to tell my hon Friend that great strides have been made towards increasing the level of exports of manufacturing industry in Britain ?
		85. Can my right hon Friend provide the House with figures to show the proportion of absent parents who are currently providing maintenance ?
		86. Will the Secretary of State acknowledge the inherent conflict between the pursuit of profit and the achievement of safety standards in all forms of transport ? As it is his personal duty to apply safety standards in transport , why did he say in reply to the hon Member for Christchurch ( Mr. Adley ) that he intends to take no effective action against a company which exposed its passengers and crew to such terrible and avoidable peril ?
		87. Can my hon Friend give a precise timetable of when individual civilian jobs at this station will disappear ? When the RAF finally leaves Stanbridge , will the land and buildings be sold , leased or retained ?
		88. On collecting performance data , has the Secretary of State seen the NHS Confederation publication “ Information overload : tackling bureaucracy in the NHS ” , which points to a great deal of duplication in information ? What is his reaction to it ?
		89. I welcome the planned investment in our railways , which is essential if we are to encourage more people to use rail , rather than road , and thus cut our carbon emissions , but what guarantees can Ministers give that works planned for the next six years will actually be completed , particularly in light of the comments we have heard from the Opposition Front - Bench spokesman about robbing Peter to pay Paul ?
		90. On the subject of hospital accident and emergency admissions , is my right hon Friend aware that at West Middlesex hospital , which I visited at 11 o'clock last night , staff told me that on 30 December , the day of black ice , they had admitted 60 fracture cases compared with the normal daily total of 10 ? That is bound to have a knock - on effect for the next week or two when taken with the increase in asthma cases this winter . However , the staff are working hard , their morale is good and they should be warmly commended .
		91. Is the Minister aware of the waiting list initiative at Canniesburn hospital , whereby patients from health boards in the west of Scotland will be offered treatment in the private sector in Glasgow or south of the border ? Is it not ludicrous that national health service surgeons should have to tackle the backlog within the private sector ? Will the Minister therefore confirm that my constituents in the Argyll and Clyde health board area who require such treatment might have to travel to England for it ? If that is so , the once proud national health service in Scotland has reached a pretty pass .
		92. Could we have some accountability for the strategic planning of A and E services across London ? Nine of them face closure and 28 ambulances were redirected to Lewisham , which the Secretary of State intends to downgrade . Without a strategic approach , how can patients be confident that their best interests are being served ?
		93. When measuring the costs , the Minister should take account of not just the cost of the time to the taxpayer , but the benefit of the work done by trade unions throughout the civil service . How will he estimate the cost of what he is doing in terms of benefit ?
		94. Is the Minister aware that that wide - ranging review has been going on for 18 months while the Government dither over what to do with the Post Office ? Does he have any idea of the damage done by that prolonged delay ? Has he seen the statement by the chairman of the Post Office that that delay has already caused a sense of crisis and may cause a spiral of decline ? Why does the Minister not admit today—and thus end the uncertainty—that the Government can not find a way of privatising the Post Office which would not place at risk thousands of Post Office branches , and that the best way of keeping the Post Office successful is to retain it in the public sector where it can provide a public service ?
		95. Now that the transition of Community prices has been completed , and as inflation rates are somewhat more stable , do the Government agree that the time has come—at least from the agricultural point of view—to enter the European monetary system and thus assist farmers who are nervous about the pressure that will be put on this Government , and no doubt future Governments , about the green pound ?
		96. Can the Prime Minister explain why , under the Freedom of Information Bill , information on ministerial offices , staffing levels and staffing costs should not be made available for public scrutiny ?
		97. I echo my right hon Friend ’s comments about the Boston marathon . Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of those who were injured . Back in February , I raised with the ministerial team the subject of Olympic legacy funding and the funding of grass - roots sports clubs . I am delighted to say that since then another Pendle club , Burwain sailing club and training centre , has benefited from funding . I have recently been working with Colne football club , which will also be bidding for funds . What more can Ministers do to promote the funding that is available to grass - roots sports clubs in Pendle ?
		98. On behalf of my colleagues and myself , may I join those who expressed condolences earlier to the Leader of the Opposition ? Does the Minister agree that probably the most significant opportunity to promote volunteering in a generation will occur in the run - up to the Olympics ? A crucial element of ensuring that volunteers come forward is that they should do so from across the nation—so that volunteers from Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland come forward to show that the Olympics are here for all the people of the United Kingdom .
		99. When Zimbabwe was suspended from the Commonwealth , were our aid programmes also suspended ? What hope can the Government give to people experiencing severe poverty in that country—both black and white ?
		100. Does the Minister not recall having gone down this road once before when he came to the Dispatch Box as a Minister in the Department of Industry to assure us that the Europeans would cut the steel industry down to size ? They did not do so on that occasion and they will not do so on this occasion . Will the Minister finally learn a lesson ?

	100 sample questions that were assigned type 7 (6583 total questions with this type) :
		1. Although we understand the Secretary of State 's embarrassment in not coming to the House last week to tell us that , yet again , he had had to postpone BA 's flotation , can he be a bit more forthcoming now ? Will he tell us plainly that BA 's privatisation will be abandoned and that he will have urgent discussions— I gather there will be an opportunity later this afternoon— with Lord King about the development programme and the replacement of BA 's fleet ? In particular , will the right hon Gentleman make it clear to Lord King that the privatisation of the helicopter division of British Airways should cease forthwith ?
		2. I refer to my entry in the register . Does my hon Friend agree that research will defeat bowel and gastrointestinal tract cancer , and may I invite him to congratulate Bowel and Cancer Research on its fundraising and support for the cancer research community ?
		3. Although the Minister 's recent announcement about orders being placed is welcome , may I ask him what steps he is taking to investigate claims made by the work force in Rosyth that the playing field is biased against them by unfair subsidies given by the MOD to their competitors ? What steps is he taking to end the hunger - and - burst system of orders with the introduction of a best - value system that smoothes out procurement work ?
		4. Although I congratulate my right hon Friend on some of the tough decisions that she and the Government have made on reducing carbon dioxide emissions , may I urge her to look at some of the work that Urban Mines—an environmental charity that I chair—has been doing in trying to bring home to people the impact of their carbon footprint on our planet ? It is important to explain what the individual , the family and the corporation can do to lessen their carbon footprints . At every level , the carbon footprint is vital to our future . That means taking tough decisions , not those that the President of the United States alluded to a couple of days ago , because the fix will come not from technology but from curbing and changing human behaviour .
		5. Will my right hon Friend take the earliest opportunity to convey to the Prime Minister of Zimbabwe the deep sense of shock and loss felt in this country at the murder last night of the headmaster of Tegwani school and his English - born wife Jean ? Will she also convey our sympathy to the Methodist Missionary Society ? Does my right hon Friend agree that terrorism and murder , wherever they occur , are an affront to the whole of mankind ?
		6. I welcome the Minister 's comments on protecting the vulnerable against abuse , but is he aware of the concern among nursing homes in East Kent caused by his " Fit for the Future ? " document , especially some of its more bureaucratic provisions , which have been cited as the reason for the closure of one nursing home already ? Is he further aware of the impact that the programme is likely to have on bed blocking in the acute hospital sector ? Two of our three hospitals have this very week been closed for a while to new admissions .
		7. Does my right hon Friend agree , first , that one feature of the British economy is its slowness to respond to a stimulus and , secondly , that confidence is a major factor in pulling the economy out of recession ? Therefore , does not he think it prudent that we reduce interest rates as soon as that can conceivably be achieved ?
		8. I am grateful to the Prime Minister for his reply , and my constituents in Yoxall , Newborough and Newchurch , who have been terrorised by animal rights extremists now for five years , will also be grateful . We welcome the legislation , although , as with everything , the devil will be in the detail . But does the Prime Minister also accept that there are genuine animal rights campaigners ? What does he say to those who read the pamphlet , " Labour Britain : New Life for Animals " , which made the pledge in 1997 that a Labour Government " will support a Royal Commission to review the effectiveness and justification of animal experiments " ? Does the Prime Minister not stick to what he promised , or was that just talk again ?
		9. I am disappointed that there are no statistics on the number of churches that require major repairs , especially in the light of the information provided by my hon Friend the Member for Loughborough ( Mr. Reed ) about the £ 400,000 cost of repairing his local church . I am unsure of the mechanism that the Church Commissioners use to distribute cash to the localities , but may I make a practical suggestion ? Would it not be fair and equitable for them to use the index of deprivation , which extends down to ward level , in determining how much money goes to each diocese in the country ?
		10. I thank my hon and learned Friend for that full answer , but will he examine the present campaign of civil disobedience being conducted by the Scottish National Party ? Does he agree that it resembles less the conduct of Mahatma Gandhi than the behaviour of teenage hooligans chucking bricks at greenhouses only to defy authority ?
		11. I thank the Minister for that reply . First , I am sure that my constituent , David Cole , who is currently in Gaza would like me to use this opportunity to thank those Government officials who eventually helped him to be able to get there . However , I know that he is concerned that the number of trucks going into Gaza is about a third less than the number that were able to go in before the blockade . I am glad the Minister has already made representations , but will he specifically ask the Israeli and Greek Governments why they will not allow unarmed humanitarian volunteers to deliver medical supplies to Gaza by boat , through the flotilla ?
		12. I warmly welcome both Lord Ashdown ’s report and the Government ’s response . In a humanitarian crisis , securing access to clean water and sanitation is often one of the key challenges . Does the Secretary of State agree that it is hugely important that engineering charities such as RedR and WaterAid are given the support they need to provide technical assistance in an emergency and upskill local people to make that sustainable ?
		13. What is the hon and learned Gentleman going to do about the widespread public perception that white - collar crime is easy to get away with in this country ; that there are very few prosecutions and , when there are prosecutions , sentences are wholly inadequate ? Is it not an opinion that has some validity that , if one commits a mega - big white - collar crime , one gets away with it whereas , if one is a minnow , one gets prosecuted ?
		14. Thank you , Mr Speaker . It is nice to be given such a warm welcome . Our hearts go out to all those who are suffering the consequences of the severe flooding in the north - west this week . Given that thousands of families are affected , the priority must be for the Government to give immediate help to all of them . Yet one year on from the 2013 - 14 floods , it emerged that only 15 % of those affected had received payments from the Government ’s repair and renew scheme . Does the Chancellor agree that that can not possibly be allowed to happen again ? These people need urgent help now , so will he today give the House a guarantee that people will receive the help they need , and quickly ?
		15. May I welcome the tough announcement that the Chancellor has made ? The 2.5 per cent . cut that he announced will free up resources for our priorities of health and education , and I look forward to that . I welcome strongly the announcement on housing , but is the Chancellor selling off assets to ensure that the proceeds are made available for additional housing , and in particular affordable housing ?
		16. Is the Minister aware that people on Merseyside felt that the Government 's action , or inaction , over the pollution of the River Mersey by an oil spill left a lot to be desired ? Should we not congratulate the local government workers who responded immediately to that problem and who probably reduced the effect of what must be the worst environmental problem that Britain has faced since the Secretary of State came into office ? I was surprised that the Secretary of State did not make himself available on day one to make a proper assessment of the situation on the Mersey , and I have to agree with the hon Member for Liverpool , Mossley Hill ( Mr. Alton ) , who said that the oil company ought to pay the maximum amount of money necessary for clearing up the oil spillage for the damage and for the money that has already been spent on cleaning up the Mersey basin .
		17. Statutory arrangements for the improvement of the governance of the National Audit Office were to have been included in the constitutional renewal Bill , but as the future of that legislation is currently unclear , does the right hon and learned Lady agree with the right hon Member for Swansea , West ( Mr. Williams ) , who has written to the Prime Minister on the issue , that it might be simpler and more sensible to have a separate , stand - alone Bill , that makes sure that the future of the National Audit Office is safeguarded ? Will she talk to the Prime Minister—and to herself , in her capacity as Leader of the House—about that ?
		18. It is now nearly three months since Lord Haskins published his report reviewing the work of all the agencies included in the structure of DEFRA. Within a day of it being published , Lord Haskins summarised the findings of his 172-page report in six simple words , when he described DEFRA as a " dog 's dinner of the highest order " . When the Minister last answered a written question on headcount , he said that information on staffing numbers at the Environment Agency and the Countryside Agency were not available , and that the information on non - departmental public bodies was not held centrally . Does not the lack of clarity in the staffing numbers at DEFRA show that it is a dog 's dinner , the content of which is a mystery ?
		19. Could the Minister institute a study into the success rates of students taking foreign languages at GCSE and A - level , linking that with the constant drip , drip , drip of rainwater passing through leaking school roofs into buckets in the corners ? In the county of South Glamorgan , part of which I have the honour to represent , the estimated cost of putting right the backlog of repairs to school buildings has now risen to £ 32 million , but the annual budget for repairing those roofs is only £ 9 million . How long is it——
		20. Would my colleagues on the Front Bench reaffirm to the good people of Chorley that there will be free swimming lessons for young people and pensioners in the next financial year ?
		21. How can the Secretary of State continue to defend the bedroom tax when there are not enough smaller properties for people to move into , even if it were the right thing to do ?
		22. I have been pressing Ministers for Crossrail for 11 years , so I am pleased that the Government yesterday gave their support in principle . I congratulate my right hon Friend on that , but can he assure me , and millions of Londoners and visitors to this city , that there will be no further unnecessary delays in the project , that early legislation will be introduced in the hybrid Bill and that trains will be running from Shenfield through Ilford and Stratford , and from Paddington to Heathrow , on Crossrail within a decade ?
		23. As my right hon Friend has said , we all agree that health and safety legislation , when applied correctly , is very useful and important , but does he also agree that when it is applied inappropriately and gold - plated , it can cost jobs and damage the economy ?
		24. I share the concern that people should be reasonably warm and that the wheels of industry should turn , but does the Secretary of State accept that the price of electricity should command more attention and priority than it seems to ? In addition , when he meets the chairmen of the area boards , will he advise them that although the licence under which they will operate after privatisation may allow them to run funeral parlours and second - hand car showrooms , and other activities in the service sector which may be even less attractive , their overwhelming concern must be the maintenance of an electricity supply ?
		25. Does the Secretary of State accept that in our view teachers have an overwhelming case for an independent review ? Does he recognise that all the evidence of the last few weeks shows that the teachers are hardening in their determination to advance their just case ? Does the Secretary of State further accept that we can not continue in this way , as it is doing immense damage to our children 's education ? There is a responsibility on him to come forward with a major new initiative .
		26. May I welcome the fact that we have the first Government ever in the history of the United Kingdom to consider child care as an essential part not only of economic policy but of equal opportunities and children 's policy ? Will not today 's first - ever national child care strategy lead both to more jobs in child care and to opportunities for parents to enter the wider labour market ?
		27. Are the chambers of commerce in the north - west region more concerned than the Government about the decline of manufacturing industries , which has meant a loss of 30 per cent . of the jobs in that sector in a region that is heavily dependent on manufacturing jobs ? How much longer can we continue to trade with such a massive deficit budget on manufacturing industry ?
		28. I welcome the Prime Minister 's attack on the abuse of expenses that has so revolted members of the public , but will he also take action to curb the dependence of many Members on second incomes ? I have calculated that the Conservative Front - Bench team alone has 57 other sources of income up to £ 250,000 . Would it not be better if , instead of an alternative Government with 57 varieties of special interest , we all concentrated on the job that we were elected to do ?
		29. The Leader of the House has had a number of representations , and he has time to think about them . Does he favour the proposal in the early - day motion to set up a Select Committee ?
		30. In relation to meat production , will my hon Friend consider the annual review and agree that , although the statistics are obviously right , the narrative gives a false impression of the well - being of the livestock industry , which is not as healthy as the review seems to show ?
		31. I am of course delighted that people contact the NHS when it is appropriate , but has the Minister done any work to demonstrate that calls to NHS Direct would not have been made to other services ? What is the cost per contact for NHS Direct as opposed to the cost per contact for other services ? Will the Minister assure us that where there are well - established out - of - hours services , NHS Direct will not become a competing service but will be integrated with existing services ?
		32. My hon Friend must feel like the character in the film " Groundhog Day " in that every day he wakes up to increasing gas prices . Gas prices recently have been at a level that is a threat to industry , particularly in my constituency . Companies such as the Carlton brickworks and two glass companies , Potters Ballotini and Redferns , are seriously under threat because of the level of gas prices . Although I welcome the fact that the European Union is now considering energy and our Government are undertaking a review , will he do something in the short term to investigate why prices here are so high and why the differential between the UK and Europe is so great ?
		33. What part do the police surgeons play in the forensic science services ? Is it not time that more women doctors were trained as police surgeons ?
		34. Does my right hon and learned Friend agree that although we want everyone to obtain justice , because of the legal aid system many people are opting for legal remedy who might otherwise settle their differences amicably ? Has not it suddenly become a bottomless pit of taxpayers ' money that is for ever expanding ? Should not there be more careful scrutiny of applicants and the money that they repay afterwards ?
		35. Does it not worry my right hon Friend that so much taxpayers ' money—several million pounds—is being spent on putting forward debatable arguments on an important political issue ? Might there not be a case for getting the European assembly , the Commission and Governments together to try to reach some sensible arrangement , such as we have in Britain , whereby taxpayers ' money is used only to put forward the facts , not political opinions ?
		36. In view of the statement of the independent decommissioning commission that it is possible to achieve decommissioning by June 2001 , does my right hon Friend share my anxiety that the constant harping of the Conservative party makes the process more difficult ?
		37. Dots my hon Friend agree that wider provision of e - information and e - services by Government is only one side of the coin , and that the other is having more people gaining e - access ? Does he recognise the potential of digital television , and will he and his colleagues ensure that the Government put it to the test in technology pilots ?
		38. I agree . Putin ’s behaviour has been despicable : murdering his own opponents—assassinating political opponents such as Boris Nemtsov—as well as the invasion of Georgia and Crimea , and now the despicable behaviour in Syria , where he tries to draw a moral equivalence between British and American bombing of military installations run by Daesh and Russia ’s and Assad ’s bombing of innocent civilians in hospitals in Aleppo . This is immoral . I am not sure that demonstrations outside the Russian embassy will make any odds , but what might make a difference is if we stopped Putin ’s cronies coming to London . Why on earth do we still allow those who were involved in the murder of Sergei Magnitsky to come to this country ? Will the Foreign Secretary go and demonstrate against the Home Secretary to make sure she changes the rules ?
		39. Does my right hon Friend accept that if the Russian Government turned down President Reagan 's initiative , any action towards unilateral nuclear disarmament would have no effect on Moscow and would leave us absolutely naked at any conference table ?
		40. Does the Minister agree that it is a condemnation of the Government that they allow so many hundreds of thousands of houses to have no indoor toilet facilities ? What will the Government do ? We have 3 million unemployed , among them thousands of building workers . Why can not we build more houses and cure that terrible crime against society ?
		41. May I first welcome the fact that the Government have devoted parliamentary time specifically to questions on women 's issues ? When I attended the induction programme for child minders in the Solihull borough , I was struck by the fact that the application pack that had to be filled in comprised six booklets . That deters many people from applying . Along with the demise of play groups under Labour , that has led to the fall in the number of child care places in many deprived areas . Does the Minister accept the need for more support and encouragement for community child - minding groups ? They are crucial to the expansion of child care in such areas .
		42. Does my hon Friend agree that this is a gratifying response in the first year in which extended opportunities for gubernatorial positions have been available ? In view of the importance of forging closer links between school and industry , is she satisfied from the returns so far that a goodly proportion of people with business experience are taking up those positions ?
		43. Although output has declined as a result of the recession , does my hon Friend agree that many firms have used this difficult time to improve their working methods and efficiency , which gives hope for greatly increased output , sales and productivity once the recession is over ?
		44. It is now clear from reports across the country that not only tenants but charities helping the homeless are being very poorly served by the local housing allowance , so will the Minister agree to urgent reform of that allowance , which , frankly , is failing the very people whom it was designed to help ?
		45. Giving more powers to shareholders sounds welcome , but we know that their existing powers on executive pay have not been readily used . Should institutional investors not be made more accountable to the millions of ordinary savers whose money is at stake , and does the Chief Secretary believe that the Chancellor would be ready to exercise his reserve powers to make them disclose to their savers how they vote ?
		46. Is the Advocate - General involved in any of the cases , or does her involvement stops once a case gets to Strasbourg ? Is she likely to be involved in such cases in future ?
		47. Is the Minister aware that , while it is true that we are in the black with the rest of the world , the trade deficit with the EEC has reached such proportions that last year in manufactured goods we were in deficit to the tune of £ 2,500 million ? The hon Gentleman says that he understands that there is not a subsidy for steel , let alone an unfair one , in other countries . Does he not realise that in West Germany coking coal is subsidised 30 times as much as it is here ?
		48. Has the hon Gentleman seen the recent memorandum of the Transport Users Consultative Committee for Wales about the implications for county structure plans of the oil crisis ? Does he accept its conclusions that availability of public transport should be increased at a reasonable cost , that in any future oil crisis major significance should be given to electrification of rail passenger services and that the provision of rail connected industrial sites should be a major priority ?
		49. British military fatalities are , tragically , outstripping the capacity of the coroner service , so the receiving coroner , Wiltshire 's David Masters , to whom I spoke this morning , is relieved that his long - awaited ministerial meeting has—under pressure—been brought forward to 25 July , and that he will now be able to put the case for the resources needed to tackle the military inquest backlog over which this Government have presided , to their lasting shame . As a redeeming measure , what will the Secretary of State do on behalf of the deceased and their long - suffering families to ensure that the coroner has everything he needs , without any more procrastination , in accordance with last Thursday 's remarks by his right hon and learned Friend the Leader of the House ?
		50. Does my right hon and learned Friend accept that the sooner we introduce tape - recorded interviews in serious cases in the Crown courts , and the sooner the Government make statements for the prosecution available to the defence in magistrates ' courts , the sooner it will become less necessary to consider extending court accommodation ?
		51. Does my right hon Friend appreciate the important role that independent schools play in raising education standards in this country , and does he applaud the enormous contribution that fee - paying parents make in investing in our education system ?
		52. Does the Secretary of State recognise the inconsistency of European politicians who speak about political union and who , at the same time , use every opportunity to restrict movement within the European Community ? Does he deplore the partitionist policy of the Dublin Government in forbidding their citizens to have day - trip shopping in Northern Ireland ? Does he condemn the decision of the Dublin Government yesterday to defy the European Court , which condemned the 48-hour shopping restriction ?
		53. Has the right hon Gentleman seen last week 's report by the Gwent county engineer , Mr. Howard Pullen , who pointed out that , in the past seven years , cash for road maintenance has fallen in real terms by 45 per cent . ? Does this not explain why our roads are in such a shocking condition ? I remind the right hon Gentleman that , even in the 1930s , Conservative Governments had the wisdom to take people out of the dole queue in great numbers and to employ them on road maintenance .
		54. Does my right hon Friend agree that those are very high figures ? Does not most of the money required to fund those payments come from laity ? Does he envisage that there will be a cut - off point beyond which no payments will be made to clergy who leave the Church of England over the issue of women priests ? Does he think that , anyway , there might be more resignations if there were women bishops , which many are prophesying ?
		55. For the third year running , the Government have provided additional funds to councils to allow them to freeze council tax , which doubled under the Labour Government . I am aware that Warwickshire county council intends to freeze council tax , but will my right hon Friend join me in urging Nuneaton and Bedworth borough council and North Warwickshire borough council , which are Labour controlled , to get on board , freeze council tax and give the hard - working people in my constituency a break ?
		56. I thank the Home Secretary for the release of the papers , especially the Birkett papers . Does he really expect us to believe that there is anything in those papers , whose age is between 40 and 50 years , that can conceivably threaten security today ? What are the real reasons for holding back those papers that he is holding back ? Who is being covered up ?
		57. The Prime Minister told his party conference earlier this month that the humanitarian campaign would be pursued with every bit as much thought and planning as the military campaign . Although I appreciate that there will be a statement later this afternoon on the international humanitarian crisis , will he give the House his personal assurance that the military campaign being pursued is compatible with the humanitarian campaign ? Will he spell out in detail how it is working in practice ?
		58. I welcome the Department ’s commitment to doubling the provision of water and sanitation so that it reaches 60 million people , but will my right hon Friend assure me that sufficient priority is now being given to sanitation ? Too often in the past , priority has been given solely to the provision of clean water .
		59. Does it help the coal industry to expand its market and get rid of its surpluses if it exports coal at a lower price than is charged to British consumers ? Would it not be better to develop the British market by allowing that subsidised coal to be made available to the British consumer ?
		60. In my hon Friend 's discussions on Plan Colombia , will he continue to argue that it should be centred on the protection of human rights , and should not simply become a US - led military strategy ?
		61. Is it not a terrible admission that every police force area in Britain has seen record increases in crime since 1979—a doubling across the country as a whole ? Is it not also the case that , even if current reductions in crime continue , it will be another 15 years before we return to the levels of 1979 ? Do not the Home Office figures simply prove that under this Government Britain is less safe ?
		62. I am sure that all who are engaged in the arts in Merseyside will be saddened by that answer . I hope that the Minister will review it . Is he aware that . over the next three years there will be an estimated reduction of 7½ per cent . in the income that Merseyside Arts receives from the Arts Council ? Taking into account the slashing of local government grants from central Government , which makes it difficult for local government to make up the difference , and the abolition of the community programme , which affects many people in the arts on Merseyside , Merseyside Arts will be in for real touble . Does the right hon Gentleman not realise that , in an area of declining resources , his answer will come as a blow ?
		63. In one of the villages in my constituency , just outside Harlow , a community group is in dispute with the local parish church over the ownership of a hall and its land . Does my hon Friend agree that an arbitration service would surely be preferable to a costly court case in such matters , as the community group concerned does not have the resources to fight a lengthy legal battle ?
		64. I welcome the Minister ’s response . If what he says is true , why was St Leonard ’s hospital in my constituency given to PropCo—NHS Property Services Ltd—in the NHS and why has the fire station , which was closed , been sold for a rumoured £ 28 million , and neither for local housing ? Does he not agree that the best thing for public health in the local area would be good - quality affordable housing for local families , and would he not like to see that happen ?
		65. May I welcome the fact that the most recent deployment of territorial infantry has been in formed companies or platoons , including a company of Paras that is just going out ? I urge the Minister of State to look again at the mostly Regular Army - driven paper , which proposes converting TA infantry companies into little more than recruiting organisations and squaring the circle by expanding the number of full - time instructors who are non - deployable . That is not what the Territorial Army at the working level wants .
		66. Is not that a wonderful achievement when we recall that Hong Kong is short of land and building materials ? Should not the House congratulate Hong Kong and take note of what it has done , bearing in mind that private enterprise gets on with the job and provides much - needed housing ?
		67. The Secretary of State just said that he wants to focus on getting those on incapacity benefit into work . We learnt on Friday that the latest figures show that 510,000 people came from the new Commonwealth countries of India , Pakistan , Sri Lanka and elsewhere , presumably looking for work . He must surely accept that there are not that many vacancies available . How will he achieve what he hopes to do when able - bodied people are coming from central and eastern Europe , as well as new Commonwealth countries , and competing with people on incapacity benefit ?
		68. Is it not clear that Britain not only receives the lion 's share of inward investment from Japan , Korea and the United States , but is increasingly getting inward investment from France and Germany as well ? Is it not the clearest sign that the Government have got their policies right on the economy , on social costs and on trade union reform when even French and German business men vote with their feet and come to Britain ?
		69. Does the Minister agree that there is little value in reducing the salmonella content of British eggs if we allow salmonella to be imported wholesale ? Will he confirm the point made by my hon Friend the Member for South Shields ( Dr. Clark ) that salmonella has been found in imported Dutch eggs but that , by the time that tests reveal the presence of salmonella , the eggs have been distributed and are adorning the breakfast plates of Britain ? Why does the Minister not use the available EEC regulations on contaminated food and stop the distribution of imported eggs until they arc tested and cleared ?
		70. I am most grateful to the hon Gentleman for that reply . Will he convey our warmest wishes for a speedy recovery to the Second Church Estates Commissioner , the hon Member for Middlesbrough ( Sir Stuart Bell ) ? Does the hon Gentleman accept that the cost to the taxpayer of administering grants from English Heritage puts a burden on the state , whereas reduced VAT—the subject of an ongoing campaign by me and many Members on both sides of the House—would actually help churches , bearing in mind that they have a particular role in rural constituencies such as Vale of York ?
		71. The right hon Gentleman will know that my interest in Zimbabwe goes back 30 years . We both believe that it holds perhaps the greatest potential of any country in central southern Africa . Would he emphasise to the House that we have no argument whatever with the good people of Zimbabwe and that we want to play our part through aid to ensure that they do not suffer through the mismanagement and wickedness of their Government ? Will he assure us that aid will continue to flow to Zimbabwe , but that it will go through non - governmental organisations and direct to projects that will help the people of that long - suffering country ?
		72. I welcome that reply so far as it goes , but will the Financial Secretary give an assurance that this matter will be treated with the utmost urgency ? A lot of people are affected .
		73. Why does this country spend the lowest proportion of GDP on research and development of all our major competitors ? Will not our balance of payments continue to deteriorate unless something is done about that ? What do the Government intend to do to ensure increased spending on research and development ?
		74. Does my right hon Friend share the concern that the referendum question submitted to the Electoral Commission by the Scottish Government is weighted in favour of a positive outcome ?
		75. If that announcement is made at 12.30 pm , it will have a devastating impact on my constituency . Will the Minister confirm that the Welsh Assembly Government , through the Welsh Development Agency , have made available £ 100 million for infrastructure to support the Metrix bid ? Does he agree that if the contract , worth up to £ 16 billion , is awarded to south Wales , it will enhance Labour Assembly Members ' prospects of being re - elected to the Assembly , and therefore of retaining control of the Welsh Assembly ?
		76. Does my right hon and learned Friend agree that , as long as we continue defence exports on such a major scale , it is in our interests also to subscribe to those initiatives sponsored by the UN and others for humanitarian rules in such exports ? That will mean that companies such as Computing Devices Ltd. in my constituency will be able to continue to offer employment to my constituents in that field .
		77. Although I am glad to hear that , is the Minister aware of the distrust in the film industry because of the contradictory and soothing statements and recommendations that are being made , not least by the right hon Gentleman himself ? Does the Minister agree that there is a great need for an indigenous film industry in this country and that the best way to achieve that , at least in the interim , is by adequate financing of the National Film Finance Corporation ? Finally , will he confirm that , if there are any arrangements with the Eady levy , he will not use that as an excuse for reducing Government expenditure ?
		78. Does my right hon Friend accept that his concept of a European Union of nation states co - operating and working together for their common interests is in touch with the majority view in the country ? Does it not contrast starkly with the policies of the Opposition parties , which can be described as a total sell - out to Brussels ?
		79. May we applaud the Minister 's willingness to tell his own side the fact of life that no other country in the world discriminates against the majority of its population on the grounds of colour ? In view of our longer - term and trading interests in the rest of Africa , will he seek to discourage new investment by British firms in South Africa ?
		80. Does the Minister accept that that percentage is considerably in excess of what Britain is making available ? Does he realise that , notwithstanding his earlier answer about the quality of our aid , quantity is clearly important ? What steps will be take to ensure that Britain 's aid to the poorest countries is increased to a higher proportion of our GNP , and when will it reach the United Nations recommended level of 0·7 per cent . of GNP ?
		81. I am delighted to hear that my right hon Friend will be meeting representatives of village communities , but may I urge her not just to think of villages as being places in rural areas ? There are villages in former mining constituencies , many of which share the characteristics of rural constituencies , such as difficulties with access and , in particular , in attracting lottery funding . I urge her to keep under constant review the question of how we can fairly make more money available to former mining constituencies .
		82. Does my right hon Friend agree that the recommendation of the Select Committee an Procedure should be a modest discipline on colleagues in relation to the Table Office , and that even the most timorous of hon Members do not need to be nannied by their personal assistants , secretaries and others and can jolly well table their own questions , as the older of us have always done ?
		83. Does the Minister concur with the view expressed by the Secretary of State for Education and Science ? How many teachers in Wales does he intend to sack ?
		84. Skegness court is one of the most underused in the country and one of the least able to cope with vulnerable prisoners . I am not sentimental about the building , but will the Minister assure me that we can still dispense justice locally in Skegness , perhaps in another facility ?
		85. I suppose that half a loaf is better than no bread , but is the Chancellor aware that experience over the last year and the demands now being made in Europe suggest that the cost of the CAP will be enormously greater over the next two or three years ? Will not the burden on Britain therefore increase rather than diminish ?
		86. I hear what the Minister says , but does he agree that although the police are free to recruit , they need to be supported by resources ? In his reforms of the police , will the Home Secretary consider that they need further resources , will he ensure that those resources are available and , in making those resources available , will he take into consideration the partnership that needs to be forged between the police , the local community and local authorities ?
		87. I gave the Paymaster General 's office four days ' notice of my question in the hope of a considered reply . Does the Minister dispute the enunciation by Sir Kenneth Clucas , who is a distinguished civil servant , that on 4 January the Prime Minister put Sir Robert Armstrong in a very difficult position , and that it was unethical for the Cabinet Secretary to embark on an inquiry to which he knew the answer before he started ?
		88. Police community support officers play an important role in policing our communities , so will the Minister join me in congratulating the new Labour administration in Sheffield on its decision to restore the funding for 10 PCSA posts that had been cut by the previous Lib Dem administration ?
		89. Does my right hon Friend agree that care closer to home projects such as the primary care audiology clinic established in a GP centre in my constituency offer patients better health care , make better use of resources and should allay people 's concerns about whether changes in acute hospital set - ups are matched by the introduction of community - based health services ?
		90. Is my hon Friend aware that when those appeals are heard it is not uncommon for them to be turned down on the ground that too much strain would be put on the school 's resources ? Does it not follow that local authorities must be encouraged to match the necessary resources to meet the wishes of the parents , rather than the other way round ?
		91. I thank my hon Friend for that reply and for the money that the Department has made available for 13 new laboratories in three secondary schools in my constituency . Although that is most welcome , will she tell me what measures the Department is taking to recruit and train more science teachers for secondary schools ?
		92. Although we appreciate the work that is done by the know - how fund and other agencies in promoting the training and interests of people in countries of central Europe that have applied for membership of the European Union , could we not do more ? Will the Minister review with his colleagues in Government the opportunities for students of English from Visegrad countries to have greater access to the United Kingdom to learn English , so that they can return to develop their skills in the economies and commerce of those applicant countries ? Will he consider a programme to ensure that a quality British newspaper is available in most further and higher education institutions in Poland , Hungary , the Czech Republic and Slovenia to whet the appetites of people who are very keen to identify with the United Kingdom ? All things being equal , they would prefer to trade with the United Kingdom than with our German competitors—
		93. Does the Minister agree that the effective delivery of high quality public services depends less on the grand panjandrums of Whitehall and more on the morale and enthusiasm of the civil servants who work directly with the public throughout the country ? To that end , does he agree that there is a need for a civil service Act and a national framework for civil servants ' pay ?
		94. Does the hon Gentleman agree that much of the pioneering work in the development of robotics was carried out in this country , yet we lag behind similar countries in their application ? Does he agree also that it is often the case that British inventions are not developed in Britain beyond the innovative stage ? Does he further agree that his reply , which suggests that £ 1·3 million is being devoted by the Government to this activity , is trifling compared with what the Japanese and the French are doing ?
		95. As my right hon Friend will be aware , the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee is currently conducting an inquiry into the practice whereby paramilitary organisations force people to relocate within Northern Ireland or , indeed , to leave the Province altogether . I do not wish to prejudge the findings of our inquiry , but will my right hon Friend assure me that he will do all that he can to end such disgraceful behaviour and to ensure that the plight of the victims is properly recognised ?
		96. The people of Wootton Bassett have sought neither thanks nor praise for what they have done on so many hundreds of occasions over the years , but they will be deeply honoured and very pleased by the great honour that Her Majesty has shown them . Will the Prime Minister now lead the people of Carterton , in his constituency , in filling their place ?
		97. I am sure that the Minister will join me in extending the sympathies of the House to the families of the schoolgirls who died in the tragic road accident in County Meath in the Irish Republic yesterday . Does it not highlight the need to introduce legislation to make it compulsory to fit seat belts in school buses throughout the United Kingdom ?
		98. Many small businesses in my constituency and throughout Wales rely on visitors and tourism . Does the Secretary of State agree that the product that is Wales needs extra support and help to promote its image at this difficult time ? Furthermore , we should take advantage of the relatively low value of the pound sterling against the dollar and the euro . Will he raise those issues with Ministers ? Next time he comes to Ynys Môn , will he meet tourist associations and operators to see first hand the problems that they face ?
		99. The increase is very welcome , but does not my hon Friend think that it is a little disappointing compared with the excellent figure for last year ? Why has there been a slowdown ?
		100. When the Chancellor next visits the Duchy , will he explain to the people of the north - west why it is that Tory Members of Parliament who supported everything that the right hon Member for Finchley ( Mrs. Thatcher ) said and did for 12 years are now queueing up at television stations to attack her ? Will the right hon Gentleman set an example , as chairman of the Conservative party , and reaffirm the warm loyalty that he personally showed to that right hon Lady when he was a member of her Cabinet ? Does the Chancellor condemn the things that Conservative Members are saying about and doing to the right hon Member for Finchley now—or is he orchestrating them ?
