I admit that I am not involved in religion of any kind , but will my hon Friend explain to me why on earth , given that the House voted for women priests , there should be any difficulty about bishops ?

Is he further aware that , between them , six national charities for the disabled paid over £ 1 million in VAT ? Why do the Government mug the good samaritans in that way ? Will the Minister now stand up for the charities and tell the Chancellor to take his hand out of their tills ?\n",

Do not those inadequate staffing levels explain why many of my constituents have to wait so long for their applications for disability benefit , severe disability premium and industrial injury benefit ? Why is that ? Only this morning I received a letter from a lady in Port Glasgow which states that her husband made his claim in relation to the heat cataract from which he suffers in September 1989 . His appeal , which he won , was heard on 29 September this year . Yet he has heard nothing from the local Benefits Agency . Is that what we can expect from the Benefits Agency ? Will the Minister consider employing more people in Port Glasgow and Greenock , especially in respect of such claims and those which have been made vis - a - vis regulation 72 ?\n",

Why , when the Northampton district area health authority , which is one of the most economic and efficient health authorities in the country , can provide for nurses ' pay without a cut in services , do the more profligate authorities seem to have a problem ? Is it that the Labour party wants a propaganda weapon with which to beat the Government over the head , when , in fact , the health authorities could do the job properly ?\n",

Rain comes from heaven : it does not cost the water companies anything yet they charge us for it . Why the devil are the Government allowing them to charge churches for the disposal of surface water ? It is outrageous .\n",
      "\t\t6. Why , when the Cardiff electorate rejected the Welsh Office 's proposals for an elected assembly , and when 75 per cent . of the Welsh electorate withheld consent to the proposals , are the Government proceeding with them ? Is that not a denial of representative democracy ? Why bother to have a referendum ?\n",
      "\t\t7. Is it not the case , as the former Chancellor and Justice Secretary , the right hon and learned Member for Rushcliffe ( Mr Clarke ) , put it , that if we left the European Union we would go back to a system of prisoner transfer where we had absolutely no ability to deport anybody to their country of origin unless we could persuade the Government of that country to accept them ? Why would we risk losing that progress ?\n",
      "\t\t8. The dumping of Chinese steel is crippling the British steel industry . The granting of market economy status to China would dramatically reduce the scope for taking anti - dumping measures . Why , then , is the Prime Minister supporting market economy status for China ? Is it because he puts cosying up to Beijing ahead of protecting British industry ?\n",
      "\t\t9. This is a good opportunity for the Home Secretary to be honest about the points - based system . She tends to refer to it as the \" Australian - style \" points - based system , because we all admire the way in which the Australians deal with immigration . Did she notice that last week , the Australians , who put an annual limit on work permits , reduced that limit ? They said that it was prudent to do so in a recession . Will she admit that a Conservative Government could follow that policy , because we will introduce an annual limit , but that she can not ? Will she therefore stop trying to fool people into thinking that we have an Australian - style system ? Only under a Conservative Government will we have Australian - style control over immigration numbers .\n",

Is the Minister aware that before the publication of the Transport Bill there was almost no consultation with the bus building industry , and that the companies and workers in that industry are almost unanimous in their opposition to the Bill , which spells disaster for the domestic market for new buses ? In view of that gross dereliction of duty by the Department of Transport , is it not about time that a Minister with responsibility for industry fought for the interests of workers in firms such as Walter Alexanders in my constituency , whose export record proves that it is capable of building the best double - decker buses in the world ?\n",
      "\t\t2. Is the Minister aware that there is increasing concern all over London about the length of time that people spend in accident and emergency departments awaiting treatment ? In view of last Friday 's tragedy in east London , should not the Government reappraise the proposal to close Edgware accident and emergency department and consider reopening St. Bartholomew 's accident and emergency department , so that Londoners may be secure in the knowledge that at least they will receive treatment at a nearby casualty unit , rather than being shuttled miles away in ambulances through a very congested city ?\n",

In his reply , will he dwell on the city technology colleges , which will find it extremely difficult to give their pupils what they need ?\n",

Is my hon Friend aware that , when my hon Friend the Member for Halifax ( Mrs. Mahon ) and I were visiting the technical officials of the Ministry of Reconstruction in Belgrade in September , they made it clear that we would be whistling in the wind to think that there would be any co - operation until such time as the dollars and deutschmarks are on the table not only for pulling out the debris but for the reconstruction of the bridges themselves ? In those circumstances , given the dire situation for Bulgaria , Romania and other countries caused by the severing of one of Europe 's main arteries , can not some agreement be reached that does not rely on saying that Mr. Milosevic is a dreadful man ?\n"

Given the Government 's projections of increased road traffic , there will be an increase in carbon dioxide emissions from cars until the year 2005 . The Minister 's answer showed that the causes include energy , transport , industrial and domestic sources , all of which are the responsibilities of different Ministries . What powers are available to her Department to co - ordinate all those sources and to ensure that there is one co - ordinated policy to deal with carbon dioxide emissions ? Does she agree that the problem should not be tackled by being dispersed among several Ministries ?\n",

What results has he achieved through the representations that he made on behalf of British manufacturers when he visited Iraq ?\n",
      "\t\t3. One of the tests of policing in Northern Ireland and making the police acceptable is how they deal with antisocial behaviour . Does the Minister agree that it is difficult to persuade the public that the police are serious about antisocial behaviour when some senior officers seem to suggest that the police should empathise with gangs of youths rather than deal with them when they engage in criminal acts ? In Northern Ireland , antisocial behaviour orders are rarely used by the police . What , in his discussions with the Chief Constable , will the Minister push the police to do to ensure that antisocial behaviour is dealt with ?\n",

What mechanisms exist to ensure co - operation between the Assets Recovery Agency in England and Wales and the Crown Office , which is responsible for asset recovery in Scotland ?

Is not the major cause of that imbalance between current and capital expenditure in the public sector the enormous increase in expenditure on unemployment benefits and the revenue foregone as a result of massive unemployment ? Is it not true that if , let us say , £ 1,000 million were put into a construction investment programme , the net cost to the public sector borrowing requirement would be less than £ 400 million ? Why do the Government not accept that there should be a shift of this kind from revenue costs to capital investment ?\n",
      "\t\t2. Notwithstanding the unsatisfactory nature of that reply , does the Minister accept that the positive proposals that have been made by his right hon and learned Friend the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster should not have been thwarted by his Department , that guidelines should be developed to ensure that local labour is used for inner - city regeneration plans , otherwise not only will local democracy be bypassed but local needs and the local communities will be bypassed ? Just as the initiatives of his right hon Friend the Member for Henley ( Mr. Heseltine ) failed after the riots in 1982 , does the Minister not accept that his proposals may seem largely irrelevant and will end up as window dressing ?\n",
      "\t\t3. I am sorry that that was not a more positive response , although I understand the reasons . Does the Minister accept that the Secretary of State for Culture , Media and Sport had appointed a lead person to give the funding ? That person claimed to be dealing with the Arts Council , and then—having held those involved spinning for a long time—finally said that there was no money . Was that because the Arts Council is more concerned about performing arts than other arts ? Does the Minister accept that Thanksgiving square—proposed by Jews , Muslims , Hindus , Christians and others—would be useful in finishing the waterfront ?\n",
      "\t\t4. Does the Chancellor of the Exchequer accept that inflation , as measured by the RPI , is only one measure of the inflationary tendencies within the economy ? Does he accept that the huge deterioration in our trade account and the fact that unit cost are rising faster than those of any of our competitors , are other indicators ? Is not the underlying trend much higher than he has been prepared so far to admit ?\n",
      "\t\t5. Is not the hon Member for Isle of Wight ( Mr. Field ) unduly optimistic in assuming that Ministers will admit Northern Ireland representatives to any meaningful role in consultation or pay the slightest heed to what they say ? Does the Secretary of State accept that it is highly dangerous falsely to allege divisions within parties , although that is not unusual in this House and in other quarters ? Is it not even more dangerous to pursue the course of threatening to call the bluff of Northern Ireland elected representatives , a tactic that has failed so miserably and so disastrously in the past ?\n",
      "\t\t6. Does my hon Friend accept that there is a strong case in terms of welfare for giving every encouragement that we can to the export of lamb in carcase form rather than on the hoof ? Is not that case reinforced by the fact that when lambs go over to France and are slaughtered there , they are marketed as French , not British lamb ?\n",
      "\t\t7. Does my right hon Friend accept that what is required is speedy legislation in the new year in order to stop the sort of abuse by which Lord Ashcroft is trying to buy up marginal constituencies ? Is not that the sort of practice that should have stopped in the 19th century and can my right hon Friend promise us that we will not have to wait too long for such a change in the law ?\n",
      "\t\t8. Is not the real criticism that the balance is entirely wrong in the countryside , in that we are growing vast quantities of unwanted cereals while we are short of protein crops and farm woodlands ? Does the Minister accept that the Ministry 's reluctance to issue a White Paper that gives any signs for the future is an irresponsible attitude to adopt ?\n",
      "\t\t9. Does the Minister accept that the gap between what the Government say in the House about training and what is happening throughout the country is incredible ? In west Wales , for example , the number of training weeks has been cut by 43,000 , or 21 per cent . , including 38 places for special needs trainees . The number of courses for part - time training has been chopped all over Neath , depriving particularly women returnees of much - needed opportunities . Those women can not take up full - time courses because of child care responsibilities . Is not it time the Government admitted that their training programme is an absolute disgrace and a shambles ?\n",
      "\t\t10. Does the Minister accept that there is no civil defence whatsoever against a nuclear conflagration ? Is he aware that the Secretary of State for Defence has said that in the worst circumstances only a few minutes ' warning will be given ? Is not the best defence to opt out of the nuclear weapons race ?\n",

      "\t\t1. Does my right hon and learned Friend agree that the sheer scale of the support shown by the Russian people for Boris Yeltsin and the programme of reforms gives a tremendous boost to international confidence in the long - term future of Russia ? Does he also agree that in the near term substantial aid will be necessary to help the difficult process of economic transformation ? Will he therefore comment on the quantity and quality of Britain 's aid to Russia ?\n",
      "\t\t2. Does the Secretary of state agree that when lives , no matter whose lives they are , are lost in Northern Ireland it is particularly distasteful that there are always those who will gloat over the loss of life and see death as some sort of victory ? Does he agree also that it is particularly distasteful when politicians do so , because that only feeds the bitternesses and the hatreds that ensure that death will occur in the future ? Does the Secretary of State further agree that the most powerful statement in the past 12 months was made at the weekend by Mrs. McCartan , the mother of an innocent 17-year - old who was the victim of a sectarian murder , when she shouted . \" Stop , \" and appealed to all sides to stop the killing ?\n",

Does he agree also that women are capable of taking part in combat roles in the Royal Navy ? Does not that put paid to the claim that women are not suitable and that such roles are suitable only for the chaps ? Thank you .\n",

Does he agree also that successfully helping young people will be the test of our policy of including the excluded ? Are local authorities to be given further advice on funding sixth form education ?\n",
      "\t\t5. Does my hon Friend agree that he might he being unfair to the right hon Member for Birmingham , Sparkbrook ( Mr. Hattersley ) , who predicted a stirling crisis , because the excellent policies that we are now following means that the pound is bound to be strong ? Does he also agree that in this excellent Budget the Chancellor of the Exchequer did not want interest rates and the pound to go too high ? Would not our best hope be for the Bank of England to follow the Chancellor 's excellent lead ?\n",
      "\t\t6. I congratulate my right hon Friend on defeating the wholly unwarranted and expansionary budget plan proposed by Jacques Delors earlier this week . Does my right hon Friend agree that so long as Britain makes such massive net contributions to help the supposedly poor countries of the European Community —Portugal , Ireland , Spain and Greece—we shall find it virtually impossible to meet the United Nations target for overseas aid to third - world countries in genuine need ?\n",
      "\t\t7. Does my hon Friend agree that all the industries supporting the task force in the South Atlantic are setting a marvellous example for the rest of British industry and are showing that if Britain has sufficient determinination there is nothing that it can not do ?\n",
      "\t\t8. As a former member of the Royal Commission—the only such hon Member—I should tell the Government that they would not be in the mess that they are in now with the National Health Service if they had implemented the recommendations of the Royal Commission . Does the Minister agree that the numbers of late abortions would have been considerably reduced if he had implemented the recommendation of the Royal Commission , that 75 per cent.—rather than the present figure of 46 per cent.—of abortions on resident women in Britain should be carried out by the National Health Service ?\n",
      "\t\t9. Does my hon Friend agree that the vast majority of people would rather work than claim benefits ? Therefore , is she as encouraged as I am that , in Benchill , the area in my constituency that for years has had the highest proportion of families dependent on benefits , unemployment fell by 21 per cent . last year alone , youth unemployment by 30 per cent . and long - term unemployment by 43 per cent ?\n",

      "\t\t1. I am grateful to my hon Friend for recording that success story , but the steel industry has suffered from two huge problems : first , the high rate of sterling inherited from the previous Government and , secondly , the fanatical anti - manufacturing culture of the Tory years . However , is he aware of some little rays of sunshine on the horizon ? First , in its estimate for the end of the year , Goldman Sachs predicts the pound coming down significantly against the euro , which is good news for steel , although my hon Friend should spend his wage - frozen salary on holidays abroad now , rather than wait for a weaker pound in nine months ' time . Secondly , in Asia , prices are being posted higher and order books are picking up . Will my hon Friend consider three specific issues ? First , will he ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer to put somebody from manufacturing on the Monetary Policy Committee ? Secondly , will he look harder and faster at excessive electricity prices ? There is no doubt that we need harmonisation with Europe on that matter , because we need lower electricity prices . Thirdly , will he agree to meet representatives of the industry to discuss those problems in the near future ?\n",
      "\t\t2. May I also congratulate my right hon Friend on last week 's London conference on Palestinian reform ? I support all its outcomes . My right hon Friend regularly advises us to look at our approach to Northern Ireland . Has he tried to impress upon successive Israeli Governments that , if they were to look at the way in which the parties in Northern Ireland have approached the problems there , and the way in which we as a Government—I do not want to describe us as the occupying power , although some people saw us as that—have responded to acts of terrorism , the Israelis might consider that a way of sending a message to the Palestinian people that they really were committed to peace ?\n",
      "\t\t3. Will my right hon Friend look closely at the whole concept of remand , as prisoners have an interest in spinning out their period on remand if they know that ultimately they will be convicted , because their privileges on remand are rather better than those on full imprisonment ?\n",
      "\t\t4. Will the Prime Minister lend his support to plans to extend the Robin Hood line in north Nottinghamshire , so that people living in former coalfield communities can get access to transport and employment , and those people who want to come as tourists can enjoy all that Sherwood forest has to offer ?\n",
      "\t\t5. My right hon Friend will be aware that some health authorities and trusts think that the Conservatives are still in power and are trying to cut services . In some cases , they are contemplating closing over - subscribed hospitals . Will my right hon Friend emphasise to such health authorities and trusts the Government 's commitment to major improvements in health funding this year and in future years so that they can plan on a proper basis for the medium term and give people the assurance that they will receive a much better service from the NHS than they did under the previous regime ?\n",
      "\t\t6. Will the Prime Minister dampen down the hysteria in this country about Irish - American support for violence in Northern Ireland by recognising that the vast majority of Irish - Americans , of whom there are 44 million , do not support violence in Northern Ireland and that opposition to it is forcefully , strongly and constructively expressed by their political leaders , such as Speaker O'Neill , Senator Kennedy and Senator Moynihan ?\n"

He could not get hold of the mental health medication he needed , the result of which was this unfortunate incident . His mother says that he was in and out of the criminal justice system all his life . He would go into a hostel , and then back to prison when he committed another crime .

      "\t\t2. I am sure that it warms your heart , Mr. Speaker , to see such enthusiasm among Opposition Members . The Minister has bandied about statistics , so perhaps he will explain how any extension of regional theatre touring is compatible with the continued standstill in central Government grant to the Arts Council for the next two financial years . The 70 per cent . statistic that the Minister has quoted goes back to 1997 , and it takes account of inflation and not very much else . As the Minister knows , there are already great pressures on his Department 's non - sports budget due to the 2012 Olympics and the fact that the running costs of the Arts Council are some £ 50 million a year and rising . Where is the money coming from for the expansion that he so passionately desires in regional theatre ?\n",
      "\t\t3. I am sure that the Minister will agree that local people should be consulted when planning will touch on their lives , but there is a danger , is there not , that in view of the dreadful housing and home shortage in our country , the views coming from Government Members this afternoon suggest a degree of complacency that is quite unbelievable . When will he get rid of the nimby influences in his party and start building homes ?\n",
      "\t\t4. Does the Minister agree that , contrary to the advice of the Dearing committee , the total abolition of maintenance grants is likely to lead to a real reduction in the numbers offering themselves for higher education . Do not the likely admission figures for next year already show that to be the case ?\n",
      "\t\t5. Notwithstanding the admirable efforts by the hon Member for Warrington , North ( Helen Jones ) to improve the lot of young people in her constituency , why did the figures released last week by the Youth Justice Board show a 45 per cent . increase in youth crime in the Warrington area , with crime by girls up by 60 per cent . , and a 27 per cent . rise in hospital admissions in Warrington for alcohol problems involving children in the past three years ? Chlamydia rates have risen by 50 per cent . in the north - west over the past five years . Those figures are , sadly , replicated across the rest of the country . Are not the Government failing our young people in that , rather than promoting youth facilities with urgent education programmes to encourage responsible attitudes to sex , drinking and youth crime , they seem more intent on demonising young people yet again by staging desperate stunts with fake hoodies in Crewe ?\n",

The Chancellor of the Exchequer said in an earlier answer that he thought that the monetary policy being pursued would lower the cost of credit in the economy , but can I draw his attention to the fact that if , for example , someone wants to buy a motor vehicle , they will pay between 7 and 9 per cent . interest , while credit card rates are between 18 and 20 per cent . and mortgage rates , if one is lucky , are about 4 per cent . ?
