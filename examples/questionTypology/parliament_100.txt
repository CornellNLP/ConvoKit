	100 sample questions that were assigned type 0 (21843 total questions with this type) :
		1. I draw attention to my interests in the register . I remind the Minister that the number of new starts in 2012 was fewer than 100,000 . The latest figures from the National House - Building Council show that private sector housing starts were down 13 % in the three months to the end of January 2013 , and those for affordable housing starts for the same period showed an annual fall of 19 % . Do not those figures show a terrible story of the failure of the Government ’s housing policy ?
		2. Do not those figures conclusively show that we now have the worst Government for 40 years ?
		3. I recognise that Britain 's record in provision for the under - fives is the worst in the European Union and acknowledge that affordable and adequate child care is a major barrier to many women who are trying to work or who want to work longer hours . When will the Government do something to solve that problem , create a national child care strategy and start making some decent provision for 51 per cent . of the people in this country ?
		4. Where is the community moving ?
		5. The Prime Minister , the Minister and his colleagues seem to believe that wages have something to do with unemployment , but how does the hon Gentleman account for the fact that in Yorkshire and Humberside the average wage is the lowest in Britain while unemployment is the highest ?
		6. Bearing in mind that it has been known for many years that there would be a fall in British oil production from about 1985 onwards , why have the Government done almost nothing for four years to assist marginal field development and still do not seem to know what to do as they enter their fifth year in office ?
		7. Listening to the answers given by the Ministers today , I have to say that I just can not believe the complacency of this Government . Week after week , representatives of small businesses come to my constituency surgeries and tell me that they hear the Government 's rhetoric , yet every time they go to the bank , they can not get the credit that they are promised . When will the Government stop making promises and start delivering for the people of Milton Keynes ?
		8. Do not the figures show that a large part of the huge trade that we are now supposed to be doing with the Common Market consists of unnecessary car imports that are damaging British industry and employment ?
		9. Fifty thousand businesses die unnecessarily every year because of late payment . Some £ 31 billion is owed and small firms alone spend £ 10 billion chasing outstanding invoices . While the duty to report and the small business commissioner have been much delayed , just 378 of the largest 55,000 businesses have signed up to the prompt payment code . When will the Conservative Government start doing something about the scourge of late payment ? Put some teeth into it , so that small businesses can act .
		10. Do not those figures show that the virtues of our aid programme seem to be becoming more apparent than real ?
		11. Does the Minister agree that , contrary to the advice of the Dearing committee , the total abolition of maintenance grants is likely to lead to a real reduction in the numbers offering themselves for higher education . Do not the likely admission figures for next year already show that to be the case ?
		12. In the light of those dreadful figures for youth unemployment , surely the Minister must join his right hon Friend the Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup ( Mr. Heath ) , who seems to know that the Government are pursuing a Luddite theory in linking low wages with youth employment . My hon Friend the Member for Leeds , South ( Mr. Fatchett ) has observed that youth unemployment is lowest in the south - east , where wages are higher than elsewhere . When will the Minister give up theories that fly in the face of common sense , sound economics and the lessons of history and start to do something to create real jobs for young people ?
		13. Do not the figures equally show that it was beneficial for us formerly not to be part of the European Econoomic Community , since the percentages were then the reverse ?
		14. Notwithstanding the admirable efforts by the hon Member for Warrington , North ( Helen Jones ) to improve the lot of young people in her constituency , why did the figures released last week by the Youth Justice Board show a 45 per cent . increase in youth crime in the Warrington area , with crime by girls up by 60 per cent . , and a 27 per cent . rise in hospital admissions in Warrington for alcohol problems involving children in the past three years ? Chlamydia rates have risen by 50 per cent . in the north - west over the past five years . Those figures are , sadly , replicated across the rest of the country . Are not the Government failing our young people in that , rather than promoting youth facilities with urgent education programmes to encourage responsible attitudes to sex , drinking and youth crime , they seem more intent on demonising young people yet again by staging desperate stunts with fake hoodies in Crewe ?
		15. I am sure that the Minister will agree that local people should be consulted when planning will touch on their lives , but there is a danger , is there not , that in view of the dreadful housing and home shortage in our country , the views coming from Government Members this afternoon suggest a degree of complacency that is quite unbelievable . When will he get rid of the nimby influences in his party and start building homes ?
		16. The Minister will be familiar with the refrigerator situation . This week , we have learned that television sets might also be caught under the toxic waste provisions of the landfill directive that will come into force shortly . The recycling of television sets might seem rather strange , but , bearing in mind the change from analogue to digital , is any work being done to find out whether , rather than disposing of lots of television sets , some of them could be recycled as part of the digital switch - over ?
		17. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said in an earlier answer that he thought that the monetary policy being pursued would lower the cost of credit in the economy , but can I draw his attention to the fact that if , for example , someone wants to buy a motor vehicle , they will pay between 7 and 9 per cent . interest , while credit card rates are between 18 and 20 per cent . and mortgage rates , if one is lucky , are about 4 per cent . ? When will the effect of the lower base rate reach the consumer in a way that will help to kick - start the economy ?
		18. Do not the assessments show that we shall need the gas from Sleipner and as much gas as possible from the British sector of the North sea if we are to meet the growing demand for gas supplies in the latter part of this decade ?
		19. I am sure that it warms your heart , Mr. Speaker , to see such enthusiasm among Opposition Members . The Minister has bandied about statistics , so perhaps he will explain how any extension of regional theatre touring is compatible with the continued standstill in central Government grant to the Arts Council for the next two financial years . The 70 per cent . statistic that the Minister has quoted goes back to 1997 , and it takes account of inflation and not very much else . As the Minister knows , there are already great pressures on his Department 's non - sports budget due to the 2012 Olympics and the fact that the running costs of the Arts Council are some £ 50 million a year and rising . Where is the money coming from for the expansion that he so passionately desires in regional theatre ?
		20. Do not the Minister ’s figures show that the Government ’s welfare reforms are working in Wales and helping employment for ordinary people ?
		21. Do not those figures show that the Government have no intention of providing the resources that local electors are entitled to expect , to maintain and improve standards of health , housing , education and other civic amenities ?
		22. Do not recent revelations show that the previous Government were masters of nothing ?
		23. Do not the Secretary of State 's departmental calculations show that , as a result of the £ 1 a week rent increase from April next year , at least 305 out of 367 housing authorities will have a profit on their housing revenue account ? Will he confirm that it is the Government 's intention to make maximum profits out of council house tenants , as demonstrated by the 133 per cent . rise in rents since May 1979 , compared with an average rise in earnings , by April 1983 , of only 51·7 per cent ?
		24. The Government ’s deportation of fewer foreign criminals than the previous Labour Government has nothing to do with the Human Rights Act but everything to do with the Home Office issuing fewer deportation notices . When will the Home Secretary stop blaming the law and start deporting more foreign criminals ?
		25. Will the statement on the pre - Budget report , which is eagerly anticipated , be an opportunity to clarify , if not modify , the situation on tax credits ? Will the Minister therefore tell the House when the statement is finally to be made ?
		26. The Government reward the failure of the privatiser Steria , which lost £ 56 million of public money , in order to punish the success of the workers who have saved £ 120 million of public money . Will the Minister tell us who will decide whether those jobs will be offshored ? Will it be the Ministry of Justice or the Cabinet Office ?
		27. I have been working on this problem with the diocese of Salisbury , and it has been reported to me that Wessex Water believes that the changes to the charging regime would come into operation only on change of ownership of the property involved . On the face of it , that would seem to make it unlikely that a church would be affected , but what would be the impact of a change from freehold to common tenure ? I do not expect the hon Gentleman to know the answer to that question today , but will he please let us know ?
		28. It is clear that there was much constructive work done at the G8 in relation to Africa , the Doha round and energy , but it was inevitable , as today has already demonstrated , that the concentration would be on the middle east . We can agree that the recent events constitute a threat to the stability of the whole region . We can also agree that we will be able to rely on the professionalism of our armed forces to effect the necessary evacuation of British citizens . However , will the Government , on Thursday in New York , press for the Security Council to call for an unconditional and immediate ceasefire ? How will it be possible to insert an international force unless there is a ceasefire ? Such a force could hardly fight its way in . We must all accept that the indiscriminate firing of rockets and missiles into Israel by Hezbollah is unacceptable , but so too is the targeted and systematic destruction of the infrastructure of Lebanon . What would happen if the Lebanese Government , already weakened , were to fall ? What , indeed , will happen if the prediction of the Israeli Chief of Staff—that Lebanon will go back to what it was 20 years ago—comes about ? Who will fill the vacuum that will be caused as a result ? How will that be in the interests of long - term stability and peace in the region ? We must all accept that Israel has a moral and a legal right to live in peace within recognised and secure borders , but does the Prime Minister accept that that right does not legitimise action that is disproportionate and amounts to collective punishment , both in Lebanon and in Gaza ?
		29. Is the Minister aware that when I recently attended my regular meeting with the Cumnock branch of the National Farmers Union of Scotland , the right hon Gentleman was about as unpopular there as at the annual meeting of the National Farmers Union of England ? One of the questions asked by my constituents in the farming industry related to reductions in milk quotas . Can the Minister say what compensation will be given to farmers who are compulsorily required to reduce their milk quotas ? Will it be in any way similar to that given to those taking part in the outgoers scheme ?
		30. Has my hon Friend studied the alarming report published last week by the Public Accounts Committee , which suggests that the RB211 may be heading for viability only towards the end of this century ? Will it still be in production then ? Are we convinced that the target set by the NEB of a 10 per cent . return for 1981 is within the realms of practical possibility ?
		31. Given the frustrating delay that has already occurred and to which my hon Friend the Member for Macclesfield ( Mr. Winterton ) has referred , will the Minister go a bit further and confirm that November 2001 will be a firm deadline and not a rough aspiration ? How many people does the right hon Gentleman estimate will be untreatable by November 2001 who could be successfully treated now ? Finally , will he explain why copaxone is , in effect , being treated as an interferon for the purposes of NICE ' s study and appraisal , even though it is chemically and pharmacologically different , has been successfully tested over eight years and has reduced relapses by 70 per cent ?
		32. Will the Secretary of State be more forthcoming about the MINIS system , especially in relation to the dockyards ? Will he give us an idea of the loading of the yards and an assurance about the continued employment of the personnel there ?
		33. May I give the Prime Minister the opportunity to answer the question put to him a few moments ago by my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow Central ( Anas Sarwar ) ? If the Prime Minister believes in the sovereignty of Parliament , will he confirm that there will be a free vote across the House tomorrow ?
		34. No doubt the Secretary of State used those criteria in recent announcements about opencast mining . He now has in his possession a report from his inspector concerning Ynys Ffarch Fawr farm . in the Dulais valley . May we expect that the same criteria will be applied to that , particularly as the amount of coal that is to be extracted is insignificant—20,000 tonnes—and the amount of employment is almost non - existent — six people ? Will the Minister give an assurance that the same kind of consideration will be given to this application as to those announced this week ?
		35. On the basis of the number of legally held guns and stolen legally held guns used to commit murders in the past few years , how many lives does the Minister expect his proposals to save , and on what authority does he base any such estimate ?
		36. As the Minister well knows , many small businesses in Wales are highly dependent on the steel industry and will have been anxiously awaiting the outcome of today ’s meeting in Mumbai . The terms of the package that his Government propose will be crucial to any potential deal , so will he confirm that they will do everything it takes to secure a successful future for our steel industry ?
		37. While there is no requirement for a dual carriageway throughout Wales from north to south , will the Minister tell the House by what date we can expect a decent - quality trunk road from north to south Wales ? Will it be in this century or in the next ?
		38. As regards footwear , is my hon Friend aware that it is the unique combination of dumped imports from Third world countries and the restrictions on exports to industrialized countries such as Canada , the United States and Australia , that makes matters so difficult for that industry ? May we expect some change in the Government 's attitude on this matter ?
		39. The Secretary of State knows that I am a big supporter of the Jubilee line . What is the funding position of the extension ? Will it be open in March next year , as originally planned ? If not , when will it open ?
		40. Will my hon Friend tell the House by which month the decision whether to buy seven Trident missiles from the United States in US fiscal year 1998 will have to be taken ? If the decision is taken to purchase these missiles , will he confirm that the cost will be about £ 89 million at current exchange rates ? Will he explain why the decision can not be postponed until the end of the strategic review , thereby keeping open at least the prospect of saving a substantial sum of public money ?
		41. I want to tempt the Secretary of State still further on the amalgamation of the Western European Union with the European Union . If such a policy proceeds , where does that leave Russia as a member of Partnership for Peace , with its association with NATO ; where does it leave the 28 associate members of the Western European Union that are not full members of the EU or members of NATO ; and where does it leave the four neutral countries—Austria , Sweden , Finland and Ireland—whose neutrality , which they are determined to preserve , will be forfeit if the WEU is amalgamated into the EU ? What is the Government 's clear policy ?
		42. Farmers will be very pleased that there is the possibility of a vaccine for the disease , but the Minister will know that the management of sheep varies considerably from the lowlands to the uplands . Will the Department be in a position to give advice to vets and farmers about how to optimise the use of the vaccine , depending on their management schemes for their sheep ?
		43. I welcome the Government 's commitment to robust public sector efficiency reforms , but it has given Opposition Members an opportunity to launch a general attack on civil servants . Civil servants are not to be associated with waste and inefficiency , and it is not good merely to laud front - line public servants and thereby attack back - office staff . Will my right hon Friend give the assurance that whatever cuts are made , a mechanism will be in place to ensure that service quality is maintained ?
		44. Will the Minister be kind enough to tell the House who was responsible for increasing interest rates to 15 per cent . in the first place ?
		45. I welcome the Minister 's robust stand on quota hopping . Will he be just as robust on the unrealistic proposals for reductions in quotas that are coming from Brussels , which fly in the face of reality—particularly in the Irish sea ? Brussels is trying to impose on fishermen regulations on the size of catch that do not take account of the species that inhabit those waters .
		46. I welcome the $ 100 billion fund and the United Kingdom Government 's leadership in that context , particularly given that part of the fund relates to adaptation to climate change . Will those moneys be in addition to , or a substitution for , development moneys that already go to developing countries ?
		47. The right hon Lady will be aware of the effect of the Government 's policies on unemployment in Liverpool and the cuts in public expenditure which affect school children , the disabled , the sick and the aged . Will she be in a position to accept a petition signed by nearly 100,000 people protesting against the proposed closure of the Royal Liverpool children 's hospital ? I assure the Prime Minister that if she visits Liverpool she will receive a hot reception .
		48. Will my right hon Friend be in a position , when she next meets the members of the National Economic Development Council , to report to them on the progress that the Government have made with their plans for a more wide - ranging and well - informed consultation body , either within NEDO or elsewhere , to bring about a more realistic understanding of exactly what the economy can stand and of public sector pay bargaining ?
		49. Will the right hon Lady now give the House her answer to the question that I put originally ? It is one of the issues about which people have the right to demonstrate . Will she tell us when she thinks she will be able to return to the level of inflation that prevailed when she took office ? If she will not give a straight answer to that queston , will she say when she will be able to return to the level of unemployment that prevailed when she took office ? Will she go through the list ? These are issues on which people will demonstrate throughout the country . Until she takes measures in this Parliament to stop the right of demonstration , they will have every right to do so .
		50. There is a lot of concern in Nottingham about the right hon Gentleman 's " review " of Building Schools for the Future . Can he get rid of some of that uncertainty by saying specifically by what date that review will be over , particularly of wave 5 ? Will it be in the next week , in two weeks , in three weeks - can he give us a date ?
		51. The Minister will be aware of the widespread concern in the House that these modern medicines should be made available to patients , and she will have seen the reports from the Zito trust and heard the representations from the National Schizophrenia Federation , MIND and other bodies . Will the Minister say whether NICE has already reached its provisional findings in relation to those medicines ? If so , will she insist that they be published ? That would give those of us who want to argue and make further representations a chance to do so ? Finally , will she confirm that , if NICE finds against the medicines on the grounds of affordability , it will still be possible for the Government to consider the matter again , as happened with beta interferon ? If that is not going to be possible , will she say why ?
		52. Are there not two problems bedevilling the enlargement process ? One is the failure to reform the common agricultural policy , and the other is the freedom of movement of labour . How can there be such freedom when at this very moment most member states are tightening their immigration laws ? What would happen in an enlarged Europe with those tightened regulations ?
		53. May I revert to the question that the hon Member for Thurrock ( Andrew Mackinlay ) asked ? Will citizens of the Irish Republic be among the first tranche of people who have the documents— yes or no ? Who else will be in the first tranche ?
		54. Whatever else may be said about the two - tier pricing system , it is at least a policy , which is more than can be said for what is coming from the Government . If the shambolic performance last week was actually supposed to be the launch of a policy , does the Minister seriously expect a diversification package worth £ 25 million to have a significant impact on a surplus problem which is costing the country £ 1,600 million ? I commend to the Government the positive and comprehensive ideas put forward by the Labour party in its Green Paper on agriculture .
		55. Is the right hon Gentleman aware from his close reading of the text that the subsidiarity protocol of the Amsterdam treaty requires the maintenance , in full , of the acquis communautaire and the institutional balance ? Given that he has accepted that pitiful state of affairs , does he expect a single European Union power to be repatriated to the United Kingdom in the lifetime of this Parliament , or has he thrown in the towel and once again let down the people of Britain ?
		56. As the Secretary of State chooses to dismiss with a wave of his hand all Scottish local government , will he join me in praising Glasgow district council 's plans to eradicate dampness in 80,000 council houses ? On his current plans for spending on Scottish housing , in what year does he expect to eradicate dampness in Scottish houses ?
		57. The Minister will be aware that the public response to the White Paper was that it is a sham , designed to fool the policy unit at No . 10 rather than being relevant to the needs of the majority of schoolchildren in Britain . If the Minister disagrees , and we are to take seriously the Government 's proposal that there should be a grammar school in every town , will she say how many she expects there will be—first , before the general election and , secondly , before the millennium ? Finally , let me raise a matter that was significant by its omission from yesterday 's White Paper : how much new money has the Department been promised to create those new grammar schools ?
		58. Local communities in Northumberland are keen to access the future cycling fund . Will the Minister meet me and representatives from Northumberland to discuss how the LEP and individual communities can access future funds , and when that will happen ?
		59. Page 28 of the Minister ’s consultation document states that future Thameslink services may serve Sevenoaks as well as Dartford and Orpington . Will the rail Minister confirm that , if those services go ahead , they will include a stop at Lewisham , and will be in addition to , and not a replacement for , existing services that run from that station ?
		60. On the most likely assumptions about future discovery and depletion , for how long will this country be self - sufficient in North Sea oil ?
		61. On his next visit to the National Farmers Union , will my right hon Friend be kind enough to raise the problems raised with me by the Devon branch of the Women 's Farmers Union about the continuing and upgraded use of bovine somatotropin in the production of milk ? The Women 's Farming Union believes that the lack of labelling of milk produced by that method will have a still further depressing effect on the sale of Dorset milk .
		62. On 3 March , will one of the topics under discussion be a change in the manner of the writ of summons ?
		63. But even the Minister of State will accept that investment abroad is not covering the balance of payments deficit on our manufactured exports . The Government 's policy over the past 13 years has failed . It is no longer good enough for the Minister to come to the Dispatch Box and say that it is up to British industry to locate where it will . When the Single European Act comes into force on 1 January we will be looking for investment in this country by British firms in British industry , in British goods and in British jobs . Where will the Department of Trade and Industry be ? Will it be on the coat tails of the Treasury ?
		64. The Minister is only too well aware of our views on his recent performance at The Hague . They are not very complimentary . Notwithstanding that , however , will he tell us what Government policy will be in respect of companies that are currently being funded for , and are engaged in , work on European Space Agency projects—particularly Logica , which is a leading multinational team of companies developing software for all of the Columbus programme , not just the polar platform ? What will happen to projects such as that , and those developed by British Aerospace , in the future , given his statement at The Hague ? At the same time , perhaps the Minister will remind his hon Friend the Member for Langbaurgh ( Mr. Holt ) that the Wigan metropolitan brass band is also going to Australia for the bicentennial celebrations .
		65. May I therefore expect the Minister to confirm that the Government would not be in favour of a sixth terminal ?
		66. Does my right hon Friend understand that there is considerable anxiety in the schools as to how rigid this process is going to be ? Can he say that there will be a distinction between the assessment that will be required in the core subjects of English , mathematics and science and what I hope will be the broader approach to the rest of the national curriculum ?
		67. The reported bonus package allowable under new Treasury rules for the new chief executive officer of Defence Equipment and Support would certainly embarrass a banker . In the interests of openness and accuracy , will the Minister confirm exactly how many freedoms and flexibilities there will be ? Importantly , have the proposed managed service providers been told about them , and if so , please will he make them available to Members of the House and the shadow defence team ?
		68. No amount of spin can hide the fact that the dome is an embarrassing fiasco . Bearing in mind that it is already £ 100 million over its published budget , what guarantee can the Minister give the House that the dome will not need further money in the future ? If and when another bid for cash is made , will she have a word with her right hon Friend the Secretary of State ? We need to establish what role he will be playing—will he be the chairman of the Millennium Commission , custodian of lottery players ' money , or will he be in the role of Labour Minister desperate for political reasons alone to keep the dome afloat ?
		69. May I just say how much we will miss David Taylor at our Health questions and health debates ? He was always here , and always had good insights and real commitment to the national health service . He will be much missed , as he was a good colleague to us all . Will the Secretary of State confirm that patients should be able to expect equivalent access to treatment from the NHS wherever they are in the country ? Will he explain why in his Leigh constituency , the NHS spends over 40 per cent . more on cancer services per cancer patient than it does in my constituency ?
		70. Can the Minister confirm that more than 10,000 police officers , many of whom are in neighbourhood teams tackling antisocial behaviour , will be cut over the next two years ? The Thames Valley police force , which covers the constituencies of the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary , said the following about possible local youth centre closures : “ the loss of those services would mean more opportunities for young people to get involved in crime and antisocial behaviour”. So with cuts to front - line policing and youth services across the country , how exactly does the Minister expect his rebranded , weaker version of the ASBO to maintain progress in combating antisocial behaviour ?
		71. I agree with my hon Friend that it is important that we start to switch staff away from calculating the debts and into enforcement action . Could he say how many staff will be switched to enforcement action and over what period , so that we can get to grips with the huge unrecovered backlog of debt owed by absent parents towards the upkeep of their children ?
		72. In the six years since its announcement , the projected cost of the Supreme Court has risen from £ 32 million to £ 56 million . Included in that are the costs of very lavish carpets designed by Sir Peter Blake , who also designed the Sgt . Pepper 's album cover . Could the Minister say whether the then Prime Minister 's project , which was gained with a little help from his friends , still represents excellent value ?
		73. For far too long the problems of Africa have simply been ignored , but not any more . A main reason why Africa has been pushed to the top of the political agenda is the passion and commitment of the Chancellor himself , and I pay tribute to him for that . I am sure that on his visit my right hon Friend saw many of the problems facing Africa , but also the tremendous potential and promise of Africa . Could he say something about that ?
		74. I thank my right hon Friend for that answer . Could he say what impact the threefold increase in suspicious activity reports from the financial services industry since 11 September 2001 has had on the number of prosecutions ? Could he further say whether he believes that the strength of the National Criminal Intelligence Service is adequate for the purpose of investigating the current volume of suspicious activity reports ?
		75. I thank my right hon Friend for that answer , and assure her that many of my constituents who campaigned for sensible reform are delighted that it is now in operation . Could she say what action the Government are taking to ensure that publicity clearly informs pet owners of the requirement for pets to pass strict health standards to ensure that Britain remains free of rabies , and to avoid any disappointment and upset to pet owners ?
		76. Given that next week is carers week , it is important to recognise just what a vital role carers play in supporting their family and those in need . Could the Minister say what reassurance he can give carers who collect their carer 's allowance at post offices that following his discussions with the Department for Work and Pensions they will continue to be able to do so after 2010 ?
		77. Could the Minister say how the reform of rail franchising will support infrastructure investment , especially the necessary electrification on the Wrexham to Bidston line , for example , which runs through my constituency ?
		78. My hon Friend has indicated that the Government will pursue , with vigour , the interception of arms going into Gaza—such arms could threaten Israeli civilians . Could he say precisely what action is being taken to ensure the protection of Palestinian civilians from Israeli attack ?
		79. To take the Secretary of State back to the issue of Afghanistan , let me say that I fully support our troops being there , but I am not sure that they are helped by his definition of " progress " . Could he say what kind of progress there has been , given that two years ago non - government organisations could operate freely in about 80 per cent . of the south , whereas today they can barely operate anywhere in the south at all ?
		80. Could my right hon Friend say what discussion he has had with the caretaker Government of Bangladesh , in particular about the human rights abuses and about support in the run - up to the forthcoming elections ?
		81. I join others in congratulating my hon Friend . I know from meetings I have had with farmers in my constituency that there will be great disappointment if the scheme does not take off . What about the BSE testing scheme ? Will that still be in situ , and will beasts aged both under and over 24 months still be picked up free of charge ?
		82. I welcome the expansion of screening programmes , but can the Minister be a little more precise about nationwide screening in respect of bowel cancer , which kills 17,000 people a year ? When does she expect to be able to roll out a nationwide screening programme , and when do the Government expect that sufficient staff will be trained in endoscopy to enable such a programme to be fully effective ?
		83. As we have recently learned that in a growing number of major companies the pension deficit is more than half the capital value of the firm , does my right hon Friend expect that , over the next few years , there will be a significant increase in the number of companies that are winding up their pension schemes completely—not just for new members ? If he thinks that is likely to happen , should not we legislate this year on the winding - up procedures ?
		84. Will the Prime Minister be good enough to convey my congratulations to the former Foreign Secretary on his promotion ? Can the Prime Minister tell us whether the appointment of the right hon and learned Gentleman is intended to result in any changes in policy ?
		85. Where does the right hon Gentleman expect this new layer of management to come from ? Will it be from the hospital administrators , who are already receiving redundancy pay ?
		86. I am grateful to the Secretary of State for that stricture , but I have listened carefully to his public response on this issue . He has been remarkably coy . For us to assist him , now that he has discounted the reply that the Economic Secretary gave some months ago and says that the situation is different , does he expect the Treasury to be able to give extra cash under objective 1 funding ?
		87. Is the Minister aware that , whatever he may say , there is growing concern among constituents in many parts of London about the potential development of major " road improvements " in their area because they will not be improvements of the environment in which many of our constituents live ; they will be problems ? Will he give an assurance that , before there is any major road development in London , if local residents call for a public inquiry , he will support it ?
		88. Assuming that enlargement is completed successfully , what consequential changes in the decision - making processes of the European Community does the Minister expect will be necessary ? In particular , does he expect that more majority voting in the Council of Ministers will be required ?
		89. In how many of the homes in need of improved insulation does the Minister expect measures to be taken over the remainder of this Parliament ?
		90. In what way does the Prime Minister expect the nature of the special relationship with America to change under President Obama ?
		91. That is pretty much what I expected . In 2004 , 3.5 per cent . of our electricity came from renewables compared with a European Union average of 39 per cent . for the same year . In what year does the Secretary of State expect the UK to hit the EU average ?
		92. In the review to which my hon Friend refers , does he expect consideration to be given to the arrangements that obtain between the PSA and various military organisations in terms of the direct line of management for repairs and other jobs carried out by the PSA on bases and in RAF camps ?
		93. In view of the critical situation in the Falklands , does the hon Gentleman expect that we shall need more , or fewer , civil servants in the Ministry of Defence ?
		94. Is my right hon Friend aware that on 15 January the Leader of the Opposition asked my right hon Friend the Chancellor to resign when the pound fell by 1·5 cents ? As the pound rose 4·5 cents yesterday , does my right hon Friend expect the Leader of the Opposition to ask my right hon Friend to be reinstated three times over ?
		95. Is the Minister aware of the absurd consequence on the other side of the coin—the reduction in passenger receipts on HST British Rail , which on the South Wales to London route is 10 per cent . and which is largely due to the Government 's delicensing ? Did he expect such consequences , and , if so , will he compensate British Rail ?
		96. On the assumption that we manage to evict the Argentines from the Falkland Islands , how much additional expenditure will be necessary in this year and succeeding years to maintain in that area a permanent naval presence of sufficient strength to deter any future aggression by the Argentines ?
		97. On bursaries created out of fee income , will universities be free to have their own tests of income , in order to decide who gets them and who does not , or do the Government intend to impose a standard test of income across all bursary schemes ?
		98. Is the Minister aware that many unemployed construction workers are impatient to begin work ? In what year does the Minister expect the construction phase of the scheme to begin ? Is there any prospect of more money , in additon to the £ 5 million that the Government have put in ?
		99. Can the Minister please say when pits other than Asfordby are expected to be opened , bearing in mind that the existing pits in Leicestershire are closing and the huge reservoir of extremely valuable and necessary coal in the Vale of Belvoir ? Will it be before all the miners ' skills have disappeared from those pits , which are emptying of people ?
		100. I compliment my hon Friend on the pressure that she has exerted to ensure that the M25 is completed , but can she say whether any studies have been made on the introduction of flexibility and extra lanes , if required , as the traffic build - up , especially through my constituency , already suggests that that motorway will be heavily over - subscribed ? Will the existing arrangements be adequate ?

	100 sample questions that were assigned type 1 (29382 total questions with this type) :
		1. Is the Secretary of State aware that extra charges would fall particularly heavily on one - parent families , especially charges for field courses and arts and music courses ? In his reply , will he dwell on the city technology colleges , which will find it extremely difficult to give their pupils what they need ?
		2. Is my hon Friend aware of the planning chaos in my constituency which has been brought about by the failure of the Labour and subsequent Liberal - Scottish National party administrations of Grampian regional council to submit an area structure plan , thus blocking discussions on local district plans ? Is he further aware that the consequent random planning applications from developers throughout the area are causing grave concern to my constituents ? In light of the imminent advent of the single - tier authority , which is much welcomed in my area , will my hon Friend reassure me that , before Grampian region 's plan—whenever it is submitted—is finally adopted , it will be submitted for local consultation ?
		3. Is the right hon Gentleman aware that this touching love affair of the Conservatives for Communist China convinces no one ? In drawing up in future his balance of power—which , by the way , is by no means as impressive as the IISS balance—will he not fail to take note of the vast Chinese forces on Russia 's eastern flank which quite alter the balance , even from the Secretary of State 's point of view ?
		4. Is the Secretary of State aware that last Thursday the UDM in Nottinghamshire had a secret ballot and voted overwhelmingly for the Labour party ? In my constituency and in Mansfield they were the best results that we have had for many years . Is the Secretary of State aware that the Tories took the city of Nottingham—they won it by one seat , when Labour had previously held it by one seat ? In one campaign the Tories won by three votes only and the alliance did not win a seat , although the Communists did ?
		5. Is my right hon Friend aware that , when I was Secretary of State for Social Services , I was told by a long succession of Labour spokesmen how wrong and evil it would be to change , alter or abolish any part of child benefit ? In view of the Labour party 's change of policy , is it not therefore right for those spokesmen to consider their positions ?
		6. Is the Secretary of State aware that one Peter Sherry , who stood as a Sinn Fein candidate in a local government by - election , recently used his manifesto to forecast which people would be murdered , and three of those murders have already been carried out ? In view of that misuse of the democratic procedures , will the right hon Gentleman view more seriously and urgently the suggestion of my hon Friend the Member for Upper Bann ( Mr. McCusker ) ?
		7. Is my hon Friend aware that , when my hon Friend the Member for Halifax ( Mrs. Mahon ) and I were visiting the technical officials of the Ministry of Reconstruction in Belgrade in September , they made it clear that we would be whistling in the wind to think that there would be any co - operation until such time as the dollars and deutschmarks are on the table not only for pulling out the debris but for the reconstruction of the bridges themselves ? In those circumstances , given the dire situation for Bulgaria , Romania and other countries caused by the severing of one of Europe 's main arteries , can not some agreement be reached that does not rely on saying that Mr. Milosevic is a dreadful man ?
		8. Is the Minister aware that the Government 's decision when they came into office not to disperse the Property Services Agency to Middlesbrough was a devastating blow to Middlesbrough and to the whole of the Teesside area ? In view of that devastating blow and the enormous vacant site in the centre of Middlesbrough which was cleared for that Government Department , and in view of the successful operation of defence establishments such as the Royal Navy spare parts depot in my own constituency at Eaglescliffe , will the Minister make representations to his right hon Friend the Secretary of State for Defence , so as to get any Departments being dispersed into areas like mine ?
		9. Is the Minister aware that there is increasing concern all over London about the length of time that people spend in accident and emergency departments awaiting treatment ? In view of last Friday 's tragedy in east London , should not the Government reappraise the proposal to close Edgware accident and emergency department and consider reopening St. Bartholomew 's accident and emergency department , so that Londoners may be secure in the knowledge that at least they will receive treatment at a nearby casualty unit , rather than being shuttled miles away in ambulances through a very congested city ?
		10. Is my right hon Friend aware that later this month in Darlington the 1,000th council house will be sold to the existing tenant ? In view of the fact that many other families in Darlington wish to purchase , will he establish from the Opposition , as a matter of urgency , in which local authority areas the right to buy will be suspended and in which it will not ?
		11. Is the Minister of State aware of the thousands of seasonal jobs that are provided for young people and students by activity holidays , and of the disaster now faced by the industry ? In his tour of the country , when he will reconnect with his core supporters , will he check whether he can find accommodation at £ 20 quid a week anywhere in the country ?
		12. In the light of the Secretary of State 's reply , will he immediately reinstitute the review of rateable values that was scrapped by his predecessor in 1979 ? Is he aware that that action has led to extreme unfairness of treatment among inhabitants of identical properties in my constituency , to the extent that sometimes the rateable value of one house is three times that of the one next door ?
		13. Is the Minister aware that before the publication of the Transport Bill there was almost no consultation with the bus building industry , and that the companies and workers in that industry are almost unanimous in their opposition to the Bill , which spells disaster for the domestic market for new buses ? In view of that gross dereliction of duty by the Department of Transport , is it not about time that a Minister with responsibility for industry fought for the interests of workers in firms such as Walter Alexanders in my constituency , whose export record proves that it is capable of building the best double - decker buses in the world ?
		14. Is my hon Friend aware that the Dalgety group also owns the Spillers factory in Barrhead which has an outstanding record in production , industrial relations and new investment ? In his discussions with Dalgety , will he reinforce the Scottish Office commitment to the success of that factory and explore possibilities for expansion ?
		15. Is my right hon Friend aware of the fact that there are not only surpluses of butter within the Community , but also of cereals , wine and sugar ? In line with the Government 's commitment , will he pursue a vigorous policy to ensure that there are no price increases , even above the rate of inflation within the United Kingdom , allowed for these products now in surplus ?
		16. Is the Secretary of State aware that the very high price of petrol and diesel in Northern Ireland—the highest in the United Kingdom—is having a severe impact on the living standards of families and the viability of businesses ? In his discussions with the Chancellor yesterday and today , has he raised support for a fuel duty stabiliser and other measures to tackle this crippling problem , specifically in relation to Northern Ireland ?
		17. Is the Secretary of State aware of the great hardship faced by some families of hostages ? In the new dawn of compassion that was at least suggested in the election campaign for the leadership of the Conservative party , will he prevail upon his colleagues in the Government to redouble efforts to secure the comfort of hostages ' families , especially their ability to maintain telephone communications with their relatives in Baghdad ?
		18. In contrast to the question put by my hon Friend the Member for Clwyd , North - West ( Sir A. Meyer ) does my right hon Friend agree that the regularly negative approach to jobs and opportunities displayed by the Opposition is the prime reason why , last month , the people of Wales gave the Labour party its second worst election result since the war ?
		19. In his dealings with the Milk Marketing Board and other parties interested in the dairy sector , has my right hon Friend encountered the same general confidence and buoyancy as is found among the majority of milk farmers in Hampshire ?
		20. We all sympathise with anyone who has to retire early for health reasons , but does my hon Friend agree that there is far too much early retirement in British society , among teachers , local government officers and , certainly , the police ? We are losing people with experience and valuable skills . In the current consultation exercise , will my hon Friend specifically state that he would like the proportion of early retirements to be reduced ?
		21. In view of my right hon Friend 's reply to an earlier question about the future governance of the BBC , what lessons has he drawn from the " News at Ten " affair about appropriate frameworks for governance , given that in that case we had a regulatory body that was separate from the companies producing the programmes ?
		22. Far from core school funding being protected , as the Secretary of State said a few minutes ago , we know that schools are set to lose £ 2.5 billion by 2020 . Headteachers in the Minister ’s county are threatening a four - day week because of the funding formula . In that context , how will he secure fairer funding for schools , especially in London , which has had the additional benefit of the London challenge formula ?
		23. In view of the recent announcement on this , I wonder whether the Minister can give us any indication of which prosecuting agency would be responsible for enforcing the new offence of reckless mismanagement of a financial institution , and what steps are being taken to ensure that the agency has sufficient resources to tackle what are likely to be complex cases ?
		24. In view of the Minister 's absymal reply to my hon Friend the Member for The Wrekin ( Mr. Grocott ) and the fact that he is not prepared to meet the chairman of Telford development corporation , will he prevail on the Secretary of State to introduce some democracy into the corporation ? Let us see some of the money that the Secretary of State is pushing on to the poll tax being spent on development corporations .
		25. Ministers have pledged an annual real - terms 1 % increase in defence equipment spending post 2015 , but in what year , under current plans , does the Secretary of State forecast the whole defence budget rising in real terms ?
		26. I am sure that the Minister will congratulate the Competition Commission on a thorough , balanced report , which draws conclusions and makes recommendations . Crucially , the commission found that " the transfer of unexpected costs and excessive risk " by supermarkets would impede investment and innovation , and would ultimately affect consumer interests , too . In what circumstances would the Government contradict the commission 's carefully considered conclusions and recommendations , particularly with regard to the establishment of the ombudsman ?
		27. In view of the Minister 's comments , why have the Government decided not to make student loans available to the over-50s ?
		28. The response to a recent freedom of information request shows that Pinderfields hospital has diverted ambulances destined for its accident and emergency department to Dewsbury hospital , in my constituency , 61 times in the past 12 months . Dewsbury is scheduled for a downgrade next year . In the light of evidence showing that Pinderfields can not currently cope , will the Leader of the House pledge urgent Government support to keep Dewsbury A&E open ?
		29. In view of the Minister 's direct responsibility for consumer protection , will he be contacting the Minister of Agriculture , Fisheries and Food to urge him to make available to the consumer information regarding the safety of the use of microwave cookers ?
		30. The Chief Secretary says that the Government ’s fiscal plans are working and that only the eurozone has thrown them off course . Tomorrow , we will know by how much the UK economy grew in 2011 , so let me ask him a simple question . In its last forecast , did the Office for Budget Responsibility revise up or down its estimate for growth in the eurozone in 2011 ?
		31. The Secretary of State will realise that this has been an excessively cold winter in Scotland , and that one of the challenges for people with disabilities is their need for extra heating in their homes . In his discussions with the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions , has he therefore pressed the case for extending the winter fuel payment to people with disability and on disability benefits ?
		32. Eight years ago , on coming to power , this Government abolished the right of successful schools to break free from local authority control , yet they are going to publish a White Paper next week that will effectively hand back that option to certain schools . In the twilight of his premiership , has the Prime Minister finally discovered his reverse gear ?
		33. I am sure my right hon Friend will be as concerned as I am at today 's news that Shell is pulling out of the London Array , which will be the UK 's biggest offshore wind farm . When it is ever suggested that there should be a windfall tax on the vast profits of energy companies , they say that they need the money to invest in new technologies . In view of Shell 's announcement today , should that policy be revisited by the Government ?
		34. Another cloud of anxiety that hangs over the future of our energy supplies stems from the reports recently by the electricity generating industry that many of our coastline power stations are vulnerable to the effects of climate change . In the energy review , are the Government prepared to consider whether new major power stations—including nuclear ones—should be sited inland ?
		35. I am sure that my hon Friend the Minister is aware of the level of biomass in the residual waste stream in industry and in the domestic sector . In addition to investigating rules on the level of biomass that may be engaged in co - firing , what investigation has he undertaken into the potential for existing power stations to co - fire biomass - rich material from the residual waste stream after it has been processed as a suitable fuel ?
		36. In answer to a recent question , the Minister stated that appeals against decisions on incapacity benefit were 65 % more likely to succeed if the appellant were represented . If we apply that to all areas of social welfare law where he is proposing to cut legal aid , that would mean at least 40,000 people each year losing appeals that they would win today solely because of the lack of representation . In the light of that and of the answer that he has just given to the right hon Member for Berwick - upon - Tweed ( Sir Alan Beith ) , will he withdraw his earlier claim that individuals will be able to prepare their appeals without formal legal assistance , and reconsider these draconian cuts , which will hit the poorest hardest ?
		37. In the light of the considerable concerns arising from the ongoing criminal investigations into phone hacking in the News International stable , is the Secretary of State now minded to postpone his decision on the future of BSkyB until such time as those criminal investigations have been concluded ?
		38. My hon Friend will be aware that according to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office there are some 250 victims of forced marriage a year . In addition , more than 12 million women and 2 million men suffer from domestic violence of one form or another . I know that the Minister will agree with me that one victim of forced marriage or domestic violence is one too many , but what steps are the Government taking to ensure a better co - ordinated response from social services to maximise support for victims and help eradicate those grotesque practices ?
		39. In the new deal with the Nissan company , will the Minister not overlook the great pool of highly trained and skilled labour in the motor industry in the West Midlands which could produce a real success for another car manufacturer , which would also bring work to the hard pressed components industry which , similarly has a large pool of highly skilled labour ?
		40. In relation to Brixton and Lord Scarman 's report , will the Home Secretary repudiate the words of Mr. James Jardine yesterday to the effect that the police will refuse to operate the central recommendation of the Scarman report that racist behaviour should normally be a ground for dismissal ?
		41. Has my hon Friend yet had the opportunity to read the letter that I sent him following my visit to Doxey primary school in Stafford , in which I praised the staff and especially the leadership of the school for its fantastic improvement in performance over the past five years ? I have noticed in Staffordshire , as the hon Member for Somerton and Frome ( Mr. Heath ) has in Somerset , that the success of schools is constrained by the low funding that they currently receive . In the context of the review of funding being carried out by my hon Friend , does he buy the argument that those of us in areas that have traditionally been low - funded could contribute much more to the Government 's agenda of raising standards if we were better funded ?
		42. In his talks with Israel , has the Minister entered into any discussion about resolving the difficulties in the Lebanon , which seems to be a key issue in this worrying saga ?
		43. In view of the great skills shortages in the railway industry , will the Secretary of State spell out exactly what requirement Network Rail will be given to make sure that we make up for the great gaps in the key jobs in technical and other areas that we need to build a railway fit for the 21st century ?
		44. In the event of a deployment in the middle east , would British troops , like our American allies , enjoy the protection of theatre missile defence systems ?
		45. In view of the plentiful evidence that Her Majesty 's inspectors of schools has given the Minister and her colleagues about the decaying state of school buildings , the massive backlog of repairs and the problems with having them carried out and about the absence of maintenance in many schools , what evidence does she adduce that capital allocations for schools are adequate ?
		46. Giving an extra £ 150 million to local authorities to streamline adoption services and taking the exact sum out of the care sector ’s early intervention grant seems to be a classic example of giving with one hand and taking away with the other . In adopting that approach , is not the Prime Minister acting in a manner more usually associated with his coalition partners ?
		47. In this year of 1984 , above all , ought not the Home Secretary to stamp hard upon such a disquieting manifestation of the snooper state ?
		48. I look forward to reading the real figures on fullfact.org , which had to correct the Minister ’s overblown assertions last time . The Opposition know that ICT can make government more accessible and save money , but the Government have abandoned the universal broadband pledge and failed on digital inclusion , so 75 % of over-75s and a third of people with disabilities are still not online . In those circumstances , is digital by default not simply digital exclusion by diktat ?
		49. I congratulate the hon Member for Thirsk and Malton ( Miss McIntosh ) on her elevation to the Chair of the Environment , Food and Rural Affairs Committee . I know that she will do sterling work . She and the Minister will know that , even with the massive investment in flood defences in recent years , including existing plans to protect another 200,000 homes by 2015 , we will need to double investment over the next 25 years just to keep pace with climate change . In the short term , therefore , will the Minister at least maintain our existing commitment to protect more homes , year on year , over the next five years ?
		50. In view of the astonishment expressed this morning by the chairman of the Local Government Commission at being directed yesterday to cease all work on the second tranche of reorganisation of local authorities , does the Secretary of State not now agree that the whole process and programme of reorganisation on which they have embarked is in an utter shambles ? It does not have the backing of public support .
		51. In view of the excess that already exists in generating capacity in Britain—the percentage of excess depending , of course , on how one calculates it —does the Minister agree that any further investment in PWR - type reactors would be a waste of money , because we have more than enough capacity , in any event , without increasing investment in that area ?
		52. In his discussions with the Secretary of State for Justice , has the Attorney - General looked at magistrates using restorative justice as part of their sentencing powers ?
		53. In her meetings with ministerial colleagues today , will the Prime Minister direct them that announcements of Government policy should be made to this House and not to private meetings of the Conservative Party , especially when they are of a discriminatory nature on grounds of both sex and race , as yesterday 's announcement was ?
		54. In all the diplomatic and other contacts that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has with the German Government , has my right hon Friend noticed that they have any less enthusiasm for and optimism about the possibility of a single currency this century ?
		55. In view of the disproportionate number of elderly doctors in the inner city areas and the number of doctors who want semi - retirement by having shorter lists , will the Minister restore the encouragements previously in existence for setting up new health centres ?
		56. In view of the fact that the Camp David agreement is defunct and is about to expire on 26 May in any case , what initiatives is the Foreign Secretary trying to mount with his European colleagues to bring forward other proposals which will be more realistic in terms of the need for the restitution of Palestinian rights ?
		57. In the light of the opportunities now offered by the reform of the Civil Service , may I enlist the support of the Minister in pressing for a Cabinet post for the arts in recognition of their importance in the United Kingdom ?
		58. In Ministers ' talks with the World Bank , have the Government pressed the American Administration to be generous in the next IDA replenishment ?
		59. In answer to an earlier supplementary , question my hon Friend referred to Sizewell B. Has he been given any information about when the inquiry will conclude and when the report of the inspector will be presented to his right hon Friend ?
		60. In view of the large existing Japanese investment in Wales , have my right hon Friend and his officials ensured that the experience of Japanese companies already in Wales has been brought to the attention of the Nissan company ?
		61. In view of my right hon Friend 's welcome words about the people of Northern Ireland , do not they now deserve a promise that they will never be removed from the protection of the British Crown ?
		62. In view of what my hon Friend the Member for Staffordshire , Moorlands ( Mr. Knox ) said about possible ballot rigging in recent Transport and General Workers Union elections , should not the TUC satisfy itself that everything was done correctly in those elections ?
		63. In view of the staggering increase in spending on legal aid , and recalling that my hon Friend the Minister said earlier that Britain 's legal aid system is the most generous in the world , would he spell out how Britain 's legal aid system is the most generous in the world because it is a fantastic success story ?
		64. In addition to the working party report led by an eminent cardiologist , is the Minister aware of the report of Dr. Farrow , of the Welsh National School of Medicine , who states that expenditure on Welsh health should be according to our higher morbidity and not as calculated at present ?
		65. In allocating funds to specific projects , to what degree has the Minister followed the order of priorities set by the local authority which put those projects before him ?
		66. Like the hon Member for Mid - Worcestershire ( Peter Luff ) , I have a number of cases in my constituency of men using the system to avoid making payments to former partners . In his forthcoming statement , will my right hon Friend tackle the problem of self - employed people who use ingenious methods to avoid their liabilities ?
		67. In the light of the growing evidence of maladministration and possibly sharp practice during the counting of votes in the Welsh referendum , will the Prime Minister urgently order a judicial inquiry into what went on ?
		68. In view of the Prime Minister 's nauseating pretence about moral concern at the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland—which makes her offence the worse—will she contemplate today what has fired her policies the more during her nine years of power : the careful computation of costs and profits that she learnt at her father 's knee , or Christian concern , which she signally failed to learn ?
		69. It is no cause for congratulation that industry is increasingly regulated , which is why it believes that the Government do not care for industry . In the light of the cost to British industry of increased regulation and the findings of the British Chambers of Commerce that the Government did not use sunset clauses in 2002–03 , will the Minister heed the Cabinet Office , which has urged the use of sunset clauses , or does he still believe that sunset clauses are a quack cure ?
		70. In view of the substantial reduction in the equipment and the morale of the Armed Forces during the period of the Lib - Lab pact and the intense opposition of the Labour and Liberal parties to the Government 's proposals to increase spending on defence , does it not surprise my hon Friend that we should now be hearing cries for further defence expenditure from right hon and hon Members on the Opposition Benches ?
		71. I am sure that my right hon Friend accepts that lone parents have been encouraged into work not only by the new deal for lone parents , but by the working families tax credit . In the past week , it has come to my notice that some people who applied for working families tax credit two or three months ago have not had their claim considered . In the light of last week 's hiccup in the transition to the new child tax credit , will he engage with Treasury Ministers to ensure that those who are waiting for their claim for working families tax credit or the new child tax credit to be processed do not fall to the back of the queue and that their claim will be dealt with quickly ? Many of the lone parents involved are already in work and desperately need that money .
		72. In view of the repercussions on recruitment , will the Minister lay in the Library of the House copies of the orders recently made about the GCHQ under the Employment Protection Act and also the legal justification not only for the orders but for the agreement that employees are invited to sign not to join a union—or to resign from a union—and not to discuss with any trade union official conditions at the GCHQ ?
		73. In my constituency , organisations such as Yellow provide accommodation solutions for young people under 25 so that they can get into work . In his deliberations on the future of housing benefit for the under-25s , how will the Secretary of State identify those youngsters who have suffered traumatic family break - ups , dysfunctional families , and sexual and physical abuse and separate them from the others ? It is a genuine practical question .
		74. We have electricity on the Isle of Wight , too , Mr. Speaker . In all this prevarication about the future electrification of the railways , is it not important to come to a decision quickly before firms with the specialist knowledge to do the work go out of business ? That is the view that I hear .
		75. In view of recent speculation in the national media that the Trident programme may be abandoned because of escalating costs , will my right hon Friend unequivocally state that the Trident programme remains part of Government policy ?
		76. In relation to the Vietnamese refugees in Hong Kong , is my right hon and learned Friend aware that many people in Hong Kong have difficulty in understanding how those people are admitted when refugees—if that is the right description ; " would - be entrants " might be a more neutral term—from China , including their own kith and kin , are not admitted and , if found , are deported ?
		77. In order to get some balance into the question and answer , instead of considering the possibility of prosecuting some local authorities , will the Solicitor - General consider an alternative form of treatment by holding up as an example of a good council the Angus district council , which is SNP - controlled , and puts the rents up and cuts public spending when it is told to do so by the Secretary of State ? Indeed , it does everything that it is told to do by the Conservative Secretary of State for Scotland and has never been in any danger of falling foul of the law in order to defend its ratepayers .
		78. I thank the Minister for that answer . Obviously , however , much still needs to be done to ensure that all pensioners in Scotland receive their entitlement as soon as possible . In that regard , is the Minister concerned by reports that one of the partner organisations in the take - up campaign , Help the Aged , has proposed swingeing and disproportionate cuts to its services in Scotland , including the closure of the Edinburgh office of its free telephone advice service , SeniorLine ? Surely that is likely to have a negative impact on take - up in Scotland .
		79. It will soon be three years since the collapse of Farepak , the Christmas hamper company , yet its directors still have not been brought to account . They were due to be in the civil courts earlier this year , but that did not happen . In recognition of how Farepak 's collapse destroyed the Christmases of tens of thousands of decent , hard - working families throughout the United Kingdom , will the Minister facilitate a meeting between the liquidators and MPs from all parts of the House who have concerns about this collapse ?
		80. In the course of a busy day , will the Prime Minister inquire into the circumstances in which authorisation was given and facilities provided for a television interview with a convicted prisoner in one of Her Majesty 's prisons ?
		81. In order to save the Northern Ireland courts and the Attorney - General for Northern Ireland from becoming , in the words of Geoffrey Robertson , QC , who works for the United Nations , “ an international laughing stock ” in defamation cases , have the Government decided to abolish the arcane defamation crime of “ scandalising ” judges , thus protecting the rights of Members freely to express their views in this House without hindrance from the courts ?
		82. In spite of the heavy rhetoric that took place at the beginning of this Question Time on both sides of the House , is the Home Secretary aware that we have good , solid citizens in Nottinghamshire who like their civil rights as well and are fed up with the intimidation , the damage and the threats to their families that are taking place ? I am grateful to my right hon Friend the Leader of the Labour party for condemning that yesterday . I hope that the House and the trade union movement will condemn it as well .
		83. In the long - term economic plan—[Hon Members : “ Hurray ! ” ] I would wait for the second part of the question . In the long - term economic plan , is missing a target by 50 % evidence of success or failure ?
		84. I am sure that the Prime Minister will join me in condemning the brutal murder of Paul Quinn at the weekend in County Monaghan . His predecessor gave a commitment that if any political party failed to uphold the rule of law and the democratic process in Northern Ireland , that party alone would be sanctioned , rather than all of the parties in the Assembly . In the light of the killing of Paul Quinn , will the Prime Minister now reiterate that commitment from the Government that only parties in default of their commitments will be sanctioned , and not everyone else in Northern Ireland ?
		85. In view of the fact that so few women who have been trafficked come forward to give evidence against their traffickers—only 30 traffickers have been convicted in the past four years in this country for the trafficking of women , because women are terrified of coming forward as they think they are going to be sent back to their country of origin immediately—and bearing in mind the fact that 4,000 women come into Britain and are trafficked every year , does the Minister agree that the Government should now implement the Council of Europe convention on action against trafficking in human beings , which the Prime Minister trumpeted in January as something that we were going to sign , and which we did sign in March ? However , it has not been implemented , and what needs to be implemented is that part of the convention that provides renewable residence permits to women who are trafficked . That allows them to stay here and feel secure , and thus allows them to come forward and give evidence against—
		86. In the new proposals , what will deal with a parent without care who is self - employed and decides to ignore the CSA ? I have constituents who have been waiting two and a half years for any payment , and some people are getting away with blue murder .
		87. The Secretary of State sought to ban parents from becoming school governors . She has blocked Ofsted from inspecting academy chains , and she refuses to have any democratic oversight of regional school commissioners . In her final days in office , with school improvement stalled , according to the chief inspector , has she not realised that the command - and - control , “ Whitehall knows best ” approach to schools and education does not work ?
		88. In the light of the right hon Gentleman 's reply , how much longer will the Government tolerate a head of household being worse off earning £ 85 a week gross than one earning £ 40 a week gross ?
		89. In celebrating yesterday 's events with the whole House and indeed the country , will the Prime Minister spare time today to give thought to the 35,000 widows whose total income is less than £ 40 per week and who have been brought into tax since the Government came to office ?
		90. In the right hon Lady 's discussions with the Secretary of State for Transport , will she stress the importance of examining the cumulative impact on the environment , especially of the proposed third runway at Heathrow ?
		91. In his discussions with the Home Office , has the Minister talked about the letter written to it by the National Farmers Union warning that British fruit and veg will go unpicked this winter because of the current labour crisis in the horticultural and agricultural industries , and what is he doing about that ?
		92. I have said to my right hon Friend previously that one of the principal reasons why I am against the invasion of Iraq is that the down side will inevitably be greater than any benefit . In relation to the question that he was asked about northern Iraq , we all know now that Turkish forces have crossed the border , although probably 2,000 to 3,000 Turkish troops have been there for a number of years . The real crunch will come when Turkish forces inevitably get involved in a military combat with the Kurdish forces . In the representations that my right hon Friend has made to the Turkish Government , has he indicated whether Britain and America would be prepared to take military action on behalf of the Kurds against the Turkish invading forces in the north ?
		93. In being—as the Minister put it earlier—a friend to both India and Pakistan , are not the Government being all things to all people ? That is hardly an honourable position in the face of such violations of human rights .
		94. In view of the concerns of many organic farmers about the threat to the integrity of their produce from neighbouring genetically modified crops , will the Government guarantee that the commercial planting of such crops will not be allowed until English Nature , the Government 's statutory adviser on nature conservation , has confirmed that they are environmentally safe ?
		95. I am delighted to hear that news . In England , the Department of the Environment issued PPG 13 , which was a major step forward in strategic planning , in March 1994 , but a vacuum has been created in Wales by the Welsh Office ? Unless those PPGs are introduced quickly , the people of Wales will have every right to suspect that the Welsh Office is in danger of becoming a second - rate Department .
		96. I thank the Minister for that reply . Is he aware , that on 12 March 1991 , the right hon Member for Charnwood ( Mr. Dorrell ) , who was then a junior Health Minister , stated in a written answer that the Conservative Government intended to abolish the emergency treatment fee as soon as a suitable legislative vehicle becomes available"?—[Official Report , 12 March 1991 ; Vol . 187 , c. 493 . ] That vehicle was clearly involved in a nasty collision , because the then Government announced the death of that intention in June 1995 . In the light of that , how does my hon Friend react to the Opposition 's criticism of what the Government intend to do , and how does he rate , on a scale of one to 20 , the utter political hypocrisy of that criticism ?
		97. In an effort to save legal aid , and following the vote in the House last Thursday , why not now exclude expressly from any legal aid application prisoners who seek to claim compensation from the Government for not having the right to vote ?
		98. In view of the obvious powerful advantages , are the Government drawing closer now to joining the European monetary system ?
		99. In his first four years as Prime Minister , did the right hon Gentleman notice the state of the universities and the pay of university lecturers ?
		100. As my right hon Friend said earlier , one of the greatest vehicles for social mobility—including on the estate where I grew up—was the opportunity for families to be the first in a generation to own their own homes . In addition to the right to buy , what measures , including accessing finance , are the Government introducing to create greater home ownership ?

	100 sample questions that were assigned type 2 (25474 total questions with this type) :
		1. I admit that I am not involved in religion of any kind , but will my hon Friend explain to me why on earth , given that the House voted for women priests , there should be any difficulty about bishops ? We established the principle ; the Church of England gave a lead to other religions , so why the endless delay in appointing women bishops ?
		2. Is the Minister aware that because of the Government 's doubling of VAT last year the Spastics Society paid £ 428,000 in non - recoverable VAT ? Is he further aware that , between them , six national charities for the disabled paid over £ 1 million in VAT ? Why do the Government mug the good samaritans in that way ? Will the Minister now stand up for the charities and tell the Chancellor to take his hand out of their tills ?
		3. This is a good opportunity for the Home Secretary to be honest about the points - based system . She tends to refer to it as the " Australian - style " points - based system , because we all admire the way in which the Australians deal with immigration . Did she notice that last week , the Australians , who put an annual limit on work permits , reduced that limit ? They said that it was prudent to do so in a recession . Will she admit that a Conservative Government could follow that policy , because we will introduce an annual limit , but that she can not ? Will she therefore stop trying to fool people into thinking that we have an Australian - style system ? Only under a Conservative Government will we have Australian - style control over immigration numbers .
		4. Is it not the case , as the former Chancellor and Justice Secretary , the right hon and learned Member for Rushcliffe ( Mr Clarke ) , put it , that if we left the European Union we would go back to a system of prisoner transfer where we had absolutely no ability to deport anybody to their country of origin unless we could persuade the Government of that country to accept them ? Why would we risk losing that progress ?
		5. Is it not absolutely outrageous that the water companies charge churches and other similar bodies for the disposal of surface water ? Rain comes from heaven : it does not cost the water companies anything yet they charge us for it . Why the devil are the Government allowing them to charge churches for the disposal of surface water ? It is outrageous .
		6. Why , when the Northampton district area health authority , which is one of the most economic and efficient health authorities in the country , can provide for nurses ' pay without a cut in services , do the more profligate authorities seem to have a problem ? Is it that the Labour party wants a propaganda weapon with which to beat the Government over the head , when , in fact , the health authorities could do the job properly ?
		7. The dumping of Chinese steel is crippling the British steel industry . The granting of market economy status to China would dramatically reduce the scope for taking anti - dumping measures . Why , then , is the Prime Minister supporting market economy status for China ? Is it because he puts cosying up to Beijing ahead of protecting British industry ?
		8. Why , when the Cardiff electorate rejected the Welsh Office 's proposals for an elected assembly , and when 75 per cent . of the Welsh electorate withheld consent to the proposals , are the Government proceeding with them ? Is that not a denial of representative democracy ? Why bother to have a referendum ?
		9. Does the Minister acknowledge that the figures that my hon Friend the Member for Sherwood ( Mr. Tipping ) quoted were based on answers to parliamentary questions that were given by Ministers in his Department , and that his Department 's figures show that the children of parents who live in a Labour council area have three times the chance of a nursery place that they have if they live in a Conservative area ? How does the Minister answer the leaflet that is produced by the Conservatives in Bromley—who provide only 2 per cent . of children with nursery education—and says that Bromley Conservative council will implement nursery education for all children when the Government release the necessary finance ?
		10. Do not those inadequate staffing levels explain why many of my constituents have to wait so long for their applications for disability benefit , severe disability premium and industrial injury benefit ? Why is that ? Only this morning I received a letter from a lady in Port Glasgow which states that her husband made his claim in relation to the heat cataract from which he suffers in September 1989 . His appeal , which he won , was heard on 29 September this year . Yet he has heard nothing from the local Benefits Agency . Is that what we can expect from the Benefits Agency ? Will the Minister consider employing more people in Port Glasgow and Greenock , especially in respect of such claims and those which have been made vis - a - vis regulation 72 ?
		11. Did the Presidents , Prime Ministers and other Ministers of the G7 countries explain why countries outside Europe found many of their businesses investing here and why other G7 countries in Europe are copying many of the policies carried out by this Government ?
		12. Is the Minister aware that there is real anger in my constituency and throughout Cambridgeshire , as people of all parties feel that my local constabulary has been robbed of £ 142,000—money that could have been spent on five or six beat bobbies patrolling the streets , tackling violent crime and other issues in my constituency ? Is not it the fact that there was never any real academic or empirical evidence to support the decision to press ahead with regional police forces ? Why does not the Minister have the courage of his convictions and admit that fact ?
		13. Is the Minister aware that the Somerset levels are low - lying and very prone to flooding , both from the sea and from river water ? Why , therefore , have the Government placed almost the whole of my constituency in flood zone 3 , which will prevent almost all development , including housing development , while failing to provide funding or means for flood relief ? Does the dull instrument on the Treasury Bench-
		14. Is the Secretary of State aware that , in view of the state of the Scottish economy , his work rate will not stand much examination ? Why , in view of his record on Linwood , on the pulp mill at Fort William and on the smelter at Invergordon , should we trust him to try to save the jobs at Scott Lithgow ?
		15. Is the Minister aware that the Select Committee on Energy has spent a considerable time exploring the mystery of the discrepancy between the Department 's figures and those of the industry ? Why , given the same assumptions , do rational people not reach the same conclusions ?
		16. Last week , London elected a new Mayor with an overwhelming mandate to tackle London ’s housing crisis . It is a crisis that many of us fear the Housing and Planning Bill will make worse . Last April , the Prime Minister launched his manifesto , promising to replace sold council houses with affordable homes in the same area . Why , then , will he oppose an amendment to the Housing and Planning Bill this afternoon that would effectively implement last year ’s manifesto commitment ?
		17. One of my constituents who works 16 hours a week and is a carer for a disabled relative has discovered that because of the living wage she no longer qualifies for carer ’s allowance , leaving her with a substantial shortfall . Why on earth have this Government forced her and thousands of others into this desperate situation ?
		18. More than 100 years ago , Parliament legislated to make sure that local authorities provided allotments . Healthy local food is a very good part of good British values . Why therefore are the Prime Minister ’s Government scrapping the obligation on local authorities to provide allotments ?
		19. The Conservative party has always claimed to be suspicious of an over - mighty state . Why , then , do the Justice Secretary ’s plans for judicial review reform strengthen the role of the state at the expense of the rights of individual citizens ?
		20. My right hon Friend the Member for Wentworth and Dearne ( John Healey ) and I did a lot of work in the last Government on the pub code , and I commend the hon Member for Leeds North West ( Greg Mulholland ) on his work too . Why , after all this time , are the Government still dragging their feet on a matter that adds a great deal to the price of a pint for ordinary customers struggling with the cost of living ?
		21. Why close St. Bartholomew 's hospital when the people of London want to keep it open ? Why close an institution that opened in 1123 , which has been open for 874 years , and which survived the reformation , the great fire of London and Hitler 's bombing of London ? Yet now it is to be closed by the Tory Government .
		22. The Minister will be aware that HIV/AIDS disproportionately affects women in developing countries . Why , therefore , have the Government dropped from their new strategy the specific commitment to measure the impact of AIDS programmes on women and girls ?
		23. If 3.6 per cent . is the correct figure across the Ministry , at least the hon Gentleman 's Ministry is doing a proper job on the quota . Why , therefore , are the Government to abolish the quota in advance of the provisions of the new Disability Discrimination Bill being bedded down ?
		24. The real truth is that businesses are increasingly desperate because their credit lines are drying up , the cost of borrowing has increased dramatically and credit insurers are refusing to underwrite the payment chain . Surely the Minister would agree that the recapitalisation of the banks has not yet filtered adequately , if at all , into the real economy . Why , then , has he chosen to reject our clear policy for a national loan guarantee scheme that would augment and underpin credit lines in a way that no Government policy yet does—or is he really saying that the Government have no ideas of their own and are simply rejecting it because it has on it the label , " Not invented here " ?
		25. The Minister has admitted that Sinn Fein and the IRA , a terrorist group operating in part of the United Kingdom , are inextricably linked . Why , then , do the Government persist in trying to insert into all accountable Executive positions in part of the United Kingdom a group linked to and inextricably part of a terrorist organisation ? Despite the Secretary of State 's determination to close his eyes to reality , if he looks along this Bench in the House of Commons today he will see the reality—that the policy of supporting Sinn Fein in Government in Northern Ireland is supported only by a rump of the Unionist party as led by—
		26. I thank the Secretary of State for his hospitality at lunchtime in giving party leaders in Scotland and others the chance to meet those who were bringing the Dunblane Snowdrop petition , which has been signed by 750,000 people . Parents and organisers of the campaign expect Parliament not only to accept the petition but to listen to what it proposes and to act on it urgently . I return , however , to the fray . Nobody in Scotland is conned by the idea that a glorified Scottish Grand Committee is the answer . When he denigrates and deliberately insults the genuine , legitimate ambition of the Scottish people for devolution by referring to " a pigmy Parliament " , he demeans the office that he holds and shows himself to be the ideologue for which so many people in Scotland have judged him . Why , in a press release issued in London last Tuesday , did he issue a challenge to Labour , saying that the Scottish people should have a say in major constitutional change through a referendum " , only for him now to tell the House that any plebiscite is the first step on the road to tyranny ? I fear that such double standards , more than anything that we propose , genuinely threaten this nation 's unity .
		27. We believe on these Benches that the Government ’s welfare cap is both fair and reasonable , and we will be supporting the Government in the Lobby tonight . But we also believe that the Lords amendments affecting vulnerable people—cancer patients and disabled people—are also fair and reasonable , not least because of the disproportionately detrimental effects , of which the Prime Minister will be aware , on Northern Ireland . Why , therefore , are we so limited in time for debating these crucial issues , which affect so many of our most vulnerable people ?
		28. Why are the colleges to be closed before the committee chaired by Sir Norman Graham to investigate the position has reported ?
		29. It has now been six weeks since the Department announced the independent review into tidal lagoon , and it is two weeks since the Minister assured me in Westminster Hall that the make - up of the review was being considered “ right now”. Why , six weeks later , has the review not started ? Although I appreciate that the Department is probably very genuine in its desire to get this work done , we need the work done urgently .
		30. There are only four months until the Government are obliged either to introduce carbon reporting or to explain why they have not . When the Members who previously sat on the Opposition Front Bench supported the proposal , they said that it would help economic growth . Why , in the present economic crisis , is it not being pursued more vigorously ?
		31. Why , according to the International Monetary Fund , the OECD and the European Union , is Britain heading for a longer and deeper recession than any of its competitors ?
		32. This Government have had nearly four years to sort this out , and pinning the blame on Atos will not get around that . Why , knowing the weaknesses of that organisation and all the flaws in how it was working , was it awarded a contract to implement the personal independence payment , which is causing huge delays ?
		33. The Secretary of State has been talking about children 's best interests . As a married man , he knows that all research shows that children 's best interests are served by being brought up by their mother and father in a stable relationship , preferably a marriage . Why , therefore , does he patronise those from less privileged backgrounds than him by suggesting that they should not aspire to bring up their children in a married , stable relationship ?
		34. According to the OECD , the UK already has one of the most lightly regulated labour markets among developed countries ; only the USA and Canada have lighter regulation . Why on earth are we trying to water down employment rights even further ?
		35. Why , when many hundreds of thousands of decent , hard - working pensioners are forced to lock into a policy for their pension in their old age , did not the Chancellor of the Exchequer last week abolish the requirement to buy an annuity at the age of 75 , as we on the Conservative Benches would do ?
		36. While there are now rumours of significant concessions , Ministers still need to explain why charities were not consulted before the lobbying Bill was published . Why could not even the junior Minister be bothered to pick up the phone to the Royal British Legion , cancer charities or the National Council for Voluntary Organisations before producing a Bill that will have such a chilling impact on the work of charities ?
		37. As Aberystwyth ’s MP , I reiterate the comments of the hon Member for Gillingham and Rainham ( Rehman Chishti ) . If we are serious about creating more jobs , and we are , that means real investment in real infrastructure . Why , then , has the Government ’s mobile infrastructure project been such a failure and delivered so little for rural Wales ?
		38. In July 2007 , the Prime Minister promised to lay before Parliament an annual report detailing Ministers ' interests . Why , 18 months later , are we still waiting for one ?
		39. Despite transport supplementary grant settlement being provided for the Wainscott northern bypass , Labour and Liberal - controlled Kent county council has delayed the start of the work and delayed issuing tenders . Why on earth did the Department not ring - fence the money so that the council could not indulge in such political chicanery ?
		40. I previously asked the Minister of State , the hon Member for Bexhill and Battle ( Gregory Barker ) . the same question , but he made such a mess of it that I am pleased that the Secretary of State is having a go . Why in the past year has Britain slipped from third in the world to 13th for investment in green technology ?
		41. Why were the Government running such a substantial budget deficit ahead of forecast , even before the credit crunch bit ?
		42. The Minister refers to the announcement on 15 November as " a whole new approach " . Why , only three days later , did the Under - Secretary of State for the Home Department , the hon Member for North Warwickshire ( Mr. O'Brien ) , sign an inadequate regulatory impact assessment of the Representation of the People Bill ? What will the regulatory impact unit do about such an assessment , which appears to ignore the credit industry 's view that clause 9 of that Bill would cost industry £ 800 million in the first year and £ 600 million thereafter . Marie Curie Cancer Care told me that clause 9 would cost it between £ 100,000 and £ 150,000 a year . The regulatory impact assessment does not reflect that .
		43. If I was concerned only with the politics of the situation , I would be urging the Secretary of State to carry on with the Health and Social Care Bill , in view of the political fallout . However , does he realise that the strength of opposition throughout country—certainly among the medical profession , as well as the public—is based on the fact that they believe that the national health service will be seriously undermined if the measure goes through ? Why is he not willing to listen to the voices of people who are so concerned that the institution—which we all believe is so necessary—will be threatened and damaged as a result of his measure ?
		44. I thank my right hon Friend for that announcement , but the criteria are complex . Why could he not have approached the matter on the basis of simply identifying individual farms ?
		45. I am sure that the House and people outside are interested to know how much support the Government have from consumer organisations for the possibility of privatising and franchising Post Office Counters . People outside are saying that Crown post offices should be given freedom of access to funds so that they can once again create a service that is appreciated by the vast majority of the nation . Why are the Government prejudiced against a public enterprise that works and is appreciated ?
		46. Why , according to the Institute for Management Development , has Britain fallen from ninth to 19th in the world competitiveness league since Labour took office ?
		47. Touching on the Foreign Secretary ’s responsibility for GCHQ , in a speech this morning the Deputy Prime Minister initiated an independent review of the intelligent balance that needs to be struck between digital freedom and national security . Even to a keen supporter of the intelligence services like me , that does not seem unreasonable . Why were Conservative Ministers not willing to support it ?
		48. The Government have claimed that the new energy company obligation will be bigger and better than the fuel poverty and energy efficiency schemes that came before it . Why , therefore , could up to 60 % of ECO funding end up going to people who can already afford to improve their homes , and not to those in fuel poverty ?
		49. I am interested to hear what the Minister has to say . I am sure he agrees that while recruiting figures may be improving , many of the units are woefully undermanned . I am also sure that he agrees that the job of Commander Recruiting Group is absolutely key and that he is the most important brigadier at the heart of this problem . Why then was that gentleman absent for more than six months last year on a court martial ?
		50. One way to stimulate the economy in the north and south , tackle pollution and reduce the demand for increased airport capacity would be to invest in a national high - speed rail link . Why , after 12 years of this Labour Government , are we still waiting ?
		51. Badger culling in England costs around £ 7,000 per badger killed ; in Wales , the badger vaccination programme costs around £ 700 per badger vaccinated . Lord Krebs , the renowned scientific adviser on the subject , has continually said that “ rolling out culling as a national policy to control TB in cattle is not really credible . ” Why , then , do the Government persist with a policy that is stupid , costly and ineffective ?
		52. I hope that the Minister is aware of Bournemouth 's strong relationship with Hampshire ; indeed , it used to be part of Hampshire . Why , therefore , are Dorset and Hampshire being prevented from considering a merger in the context of police restructuring ?
		53. The Daycare Trust reports that just 20 % of local authorities have enough places for two - year - olds in their area . Why , then , are the Government abolishing section 11 of the Childcare Act 2006 , and with it the child care sufficiency report that local authorities have to publish ?
		54. The Secretary of State and the whole House will recognise the deprivation in Newham , Tower Hamlets , Haringey and Hackney . Why , then , has the Secretary of State decided to give more money in his pupil premium to Oxfordshire , Surrey and Devon ?
		55. Why is similar instrumentation 11legal in this country and can not be connected to the British Telecom network ?
		56. The Government finally seem to have woken up to the scale of the problems that Atos has in delivering the work capability assessment . Why then has it been awarded the personal independence payment contract when it is clear that it has such serious capacity problems ?
		57. Progress in Kosovo for both the military and the civilian populations continues to be hindered by the danger from unexploded ordnance . I understand that there have been 100 deaths and 400 other casualties as a result , many of them , regrettably , from unexploded allied cluster bombs . However , 40 per cent , of the area at risk has still not been cordoned off . Given the Government 's commitment to humanitarian de - mining , why did NATO not co - operate with the United Nations mine action co - ordination centre in Pristina , when last August it asked for help in locating cluster bomb drops ? Why did Kofi Annan have to write last month begging Lord Robertson for help ? Why , after all this time , have only 4 per cent , of the minefields in Bosnia been cleared ?
		58. The Government have shown themselves willing to qualify the autonomy of primary care trusts when they feel it necessary to do so . Why then are they ignoring the huge disparity between the best and worst performing primary care trusts in the drug - prescribing habits of their practitioners and the related costs ?
		59. The Minister says that tourism is so important . Why , then , is he insisting that local authorities cut back dramatically on their leisure expenditure , which includes museums , sports facilities and leisure recreation of all types and the arts , which play a vital part in attracting tourists to Scotland and ensuring that Scottish holiday - makers are properly entertained ?
		60. The Conservative party used to support a competitive telecommunications market . Why on earth are Ministers now establishing a new private sector monopoly in rural superfast broadband by simply handing all the Government subsidy over to BT ?
		61. The Minister will be aware of the widespread concern at Defence Support Group in Sealand about ongoing job losses—and , indeed , the Government ’s proposals to find a buyer for the business . Why , therefore , has he barred me from visiting the site ?
		62. Of those 40 to 50 lives lost per annum , 15 could be saved if the European Community directive on fitting retro - reflective conspicuity tape to HGVs were immediately implemented . Why , therefore , has my hon Friend decided to postpone the implementation of that directive until the very last minute , in 2011 ? The Freight Transport Association said in Commercial Motor last month that the impact on the industry would be " minimal " .
		63. The Prime Minister will know that in 2002 Abu Hamza had his assets frozen by the Chancellor , yet the following year was allowed to transfer a flat to his son , who has himself been convicted of terrorist offences . Why , five years later , has that glaring loophole in our anti - terror defences still not been closed ?
		64. Why , in monitoring public expenditure , did not the Chief Secretary disclose the large margin of error in 1981–82 until after the Budget ?
		65. Yesterday the Prime Minister agreed that the public are opposed to Brent Spar being dumped at sea . Today we know that the Government 's own scientists also oppose that . Why were their objections overruled ? Surely it is now time for the Prime Minister to act to prevent that dangerous dumping .
		66. Why quote it ?
		67. My hon Friend the Member for Reading , East ( Mr. Wilson ) is absolutely right . When it comes to nursery places in Reading or any other part of the country , the Minister knows that the sums do not add up . Two out of three nurseries still can not provide free places for the Government money that they receive . Why , when more than 9,000 families are predicted to see their child care close by the end of this year because of the financial crisis , is the Minister failing to take action to stop the instability that is so damaging for so many families up and down the country ?
		68. My right hon Friend will be aware of the early - day motion submitted by SNP Members on the principled position that hon Members should not vote on matters not relevant to Scotland . Why , then , have they voted consistently on the Government of Wales Bill ?
		69. Why attempt to build a new runway at Heathrow when we could deliver one at Gatwick in half the time , for half the cost and with a fraction of the environmental impact ?
		70. Churches and places of worship , including many in Blackpool , do immensely valuable work in adapting their buildings for community and voluntary sector use . Why , then , is the Prime Minister backing a 20 % VAT raid in the Budget on alterations to listed buildings , which will cost many of those churches and places of worship millions of pounds—in the case of the Church of England , an estimated £ 10 million—thereby infuriating them and the charities concerned and shooting his own big society in the foot ?
		71. The defence industrial strategy clearly stated that the technology advantage we enjoy today is the result of past investment , and warns that we are now in danger of falling behind our allies and even the emerging economies . Why , then , have the Government halved spending on research and development since 1997 , cutting it from £ 900 million to £ 450 million ?
		72. The UK Government - sponsored Silk commission recommended empowering the Welsh Government and Welsh local authorities with fiscal responsibility to incentivise economic development . Why were these recommendations not included in the Finance Bill or the Queen ’s Speech in a Government of Wales Bill ?
		73. Figures published this week show the scale of the air quality challenge that faces London , in addition to the carbon dioxide challenge that faces us all , and other towns and cities have similar challenges ahead . Why , in the Budget , did the Chancellor impose a financial penalty on hybrid and plug - in hybrid vehicles , putting them in the same band as cars with far higher emissions ? Is it not time that the Chancellor talked to the Transport Secretary , and that both of them listened to what the industry is telling them ?
		74. The Prime Minister , in a recent newspaper article , deplored the way in which the courts use the European convention on human rights—[Hon Members : " Hooray ! " ] It was not me who objected—it was the Prime Minister , who objected to the way in which the courts use the convention to strike down anti - terrorism measures . We can , however , override that convention if we wish , as Parliament is supreme in this matter . Why , then , did the Prime Minister sign the European Constitution , which contains the much stricter and more extensive EU charter of fundamental rights , from which no exceptions are permitted , and which would explicitly override the House 's powers ? Will he , even at this late stage , repent of his folly in signing the European Constitution and reject any revival that would bind the House in a way that even he now objects to ?
		75. Why , of the 12 competitions held for the agencies set up by the Government , has only one outsider been appointed , Mr. David Beeton , to the Royal Historic Palaces Agency ? There are also two directors - designate who will come from outside the Civil Service . Conversely , how many of the First Division Association have been seconded to industry ?
		76. Is it not the case that nothing betrays the failure of the much - vaunted smart procurement policy so much as the decision to bail out Swan Hunter for the relatively straightforward off - the - shelf design for the landing ships dock , which has suffered a staggering 60 per cent . cost overrun , described by the procurement Minister in the other place as value for money for the British taxpayer ? Why were Ministers not frank with this House and admit that that decision amounted to financial assistance to a yard that had failed to honour its contract and a substantial pre - election bung to a company in Labour 's north - east heartland ? It will make no difference because on 6 May the Minister and I shall be swapping places .
		77. Does the Minister agree that one of the problems is a lack of knowledge of Government schemes within industry ? Why , when the Government hit on a scheme which apparently rings bells and is immediately taken up , do they not allocate a further tranche of money to it ?
		78. My right hon Friend 's excellent reply helps to confirm why unemployment in my constituency of Fylde has fallen in the past year by 30·3 per cent . , but does he agree that the figures also confirm the excellent findings of the recent labour force survey , which show that the Opposition 's attempts to rubbish our approach to employment creation are bogus and bankrupt ?
		79. I welcome the Minister to his new brief . Does he agree that until recently the Government strongly opposed both a written constitution for Europe and a single legal personality for the European Union , they strongly supported the intergovernmental pillared structure of the European Union , and they promised that the EU charter of fundamental rights would not be made legally binding on British courts ? Why , at the halfway stage of the Convention on the Future of Europe , have the Government abandoned all four of those policy positions ?
		80. I am sure that the Minister will agree that no group requires resettlement and rehabilitation more than 18 to 20-year - olds , of whom some 72 per cent . commit further offences within two years of release . Does the Minister agree that structured programmes are needed and that they must be consistent ? If early release is brought on by overcrowding rather than being planned and if we have " going straight " contracts that are not part of an integrated programme , we are going in the wrong direction because we are pushing young offenders back out into the community before they have been properly prepared for it . I am happy to hear that the Minister likes Kainos . Why , then , are Kainos programmes being closed down ?
		81. Does the Minister agree that such a marine Bill would operate in the context of the particular threat to the sea of climate change ? Why , then , are the Government threatening to sue the European Union for trying to put a cap on the runaway emissions from British industry ?
		82. Will the Secretary of State explain how the constant reorganisations have helped my constituent , 88-year - old Frances Grew , who , on Sunday afternoon went into Good Hope hospital in Sutton Coldfield , waited five hours for a bed and , at 9 pm , was admitted to the maternity ward , where she remains today ? How have we reached such a sorry state where an 88-year - old lady has to be admitted to a maternity ward to obtain treatment ?
		83. Will the Minister admit that he has lost control of the situation ? Why will he not be frank with the House and explain that the policies that the Government are pursuing and the arguments that he has put forward are not filling the void of empty houses in many local authority areas ? Is not that due primarily to lack of initiative and support from the Conservative Administration ?
		84. As a member of the armed forces parliamentary scheme and a strong supporter of the British Legion , I am concerned to ensure that returning service personnel receive the strongest possible support . Why , therefore , did the Minister admit on 10 February that his Department had done nothing to assess the housing needs of that group ?
		85. Why , when the Association of Directors of Social Services warned six months ago that record numbers of children are registered as at risk from abuse or neglect , have the Government chosen to delay implementation of the Act by another six months ? Does the Minister realise the difficulties that social services departments have with inadequate staff , training and resources ? Why do the Government preach the value of the family when they can not find the money or the time to do something about the matter ?
		86. That was a lot of words , but the Chief Secretary did not answer the question . Why does the United States have a much higher debt than we have , and why do Canada , Italy , France , Germany and Japan all have , as a percentage of GDP , higher debt than we have ? Is it true that the extent of the cuts is driven not by economics but by ideology ?
		87. On the subject of food safety , will the Minister tell us whether it is true , as reported in The Mail on Sunday —[Hon Members : " Oh ! " ] Labour Members will undoubtedly be delighted to hear whether it is true that European inspectors have not inspected a single Thai chicken factory . Is it also true that Ministry of Agriculture officials have inspected Thai chicken farms and found problems that have not been resolved ? How much longer will British producers have to compete with lower standards overseas , and British consumers have to accept importation of sub - standard products from countries that do not have British standards ?
		88. Will the Minister please explain how a single parent with a 20-year - old mentally handicapped son has lost £ 3 per week because of the flat - rate surcharge that the Government have introduced ? How can he square that with saying that the Government are targeting assistance on those who are most vulnerable and most in need in our society when that single parent family is £ 3 per week worse off because of the Government 's target ? I suggest that that is not good aim .
		89. Is the right hon Lady aware that there will be widespread agreement throughout the House with her statement , which I think appeared in last Sunday 's edition of the Sunday Telegraph , that we all depend on the prosperity of manufacturing industry ? Will she tell us plainly how she can square that statement with the figures that were published at 2.30 pm today by the Department of Industry , which show that investment in manufacturing industry is the lowest since the early 1960s and that the probable outcome for 1981 , a full year of her Administration , is zero or even negative net investment for manufacturing industry ? Will she admit that that must he seen as a disaster for Britain 's future prosperity ?
		90. Why do the Government not tell the truth about local government , instead of giving us fiction and fiddles about grant levels and spending limits , and scaremongering rubbish about Labour 's plans for the business rate ? Why , for example , do they , unlike anybody who has studied the subject , keep pretending that £ 60 million will be saved next year , compared with this year , through local government reorganisation , and then keep adding that imaginary money to grant levels to come up with an imaginary increase for next year ? Does the Secretary of State not understand that this is the worst local government settlement for more than 20 years—the final monument to 18 years of Tory economic failure ? Does he not realise that nobody trusts or believes him , and that it is time for him to go ?
		91. As the Secretary of State refers to the £ 100 million spent on consultants , can he recall any time , when he was in opposition , when he supported any money being spent on consultancies ? He talks about disinvestment , so will he explain why in every year that he has been in charge less Government money has been spent on the tube than under the previous Conservative Government ? Is not the chaos on the tube the result of the PPP being more than a year behind schedule , and is that not another emblem of the right hon Gentleman 's own personal failure ? As he boasts about an extra £ 280 million from the Budget for transport , will he come clean with the House and explain that £ 100 million of that has been cut from his roads maintenance budget ?
		92. Is the Secretary of State aware that the people of the East Kilbride part of Busby have voted to stay with Labour - controlled East Kilbride rather than to transfer to Tory - controlled Eastwood ? Why , then , has he overridden the views of the people ? Is this a foretaste of what will come with local government reform , with the wishes of the people being ignored by the Government ?
		93. The Foreign Secretary has shared with the House a number of calls that he has made to Ministers over recent days on the middle east . Given the announcement by the Israeli Government about further expansion of settlements , which we have already discussed , and the summoning of the Israeli ambassador to King Charles street yesterday , will the Foreign Secretary explain how abstaining in last week ’s vote at the United Nations enhanced the UK ’s influence with either Israel or the Palestinians ?
		94. The Minister can not get away with that . Why have the Government allowed Britain to be hobbled by a trade deficit ? Is not the Government 's failure to deal with that the reason why British people have suffered a 7p in the pound tax rise from this Chancellor ? Before the cameras come on , why does he not tell us ? Perhaps he will whisper it . Do the Government admit that the country has fallen from 13th to 18th place in the international prosperity league ?
		95. Does the Minister still believe in his crowding - out theory—that increases in public investment will crowd out private investment in the economy ? How does he explain to the British people that with nearly 3 million unemployed we can not afford to build more houses to reduce the housing waiting list , we can not improve the railways and we can not improve our rapidly deteriorating water and sewerage facilities ? How can he explain to the public that the resources are not available for more public investment ?
		96. Will the Minister confirm , however , that in July the Government were found guilty in the European Court for the condition of Blackpool 's bathing water ? Will he confirm that in August his own reports showed that two thirds of all our beaches failed to meet the European guideline standards for safety and that that is the second worst performance of any country in Europe ? Will he admit also that he is engaged in discussions with the French Government about the repeal , withdrawal and amendment of the bathing water directive ? Why is the Government 's response to failure to try to bend standards , not to improve performance ? Is not it time that the Government put people 's health and safety before the profits of the privatised water companies ?
		97. I realise that , in view of his own deplorable past support for the campaign for unilateral nuclear disarmament , the Deputy Prime Minister finds it difficult to say that he approves of nuclear deterrence . I have no doubt that he will follow the precedent set by his answer to my hon Friend the Member for Buckingham ( Mr. Bercow ) by emulating the evasive and slippery techniques of his right hon Friend the Prime Minister , and referring to my political activities in the Labour party in the 1970s . Will the Deputy Prime Minister simply answer one question ? If , now that the danger of Russian nuclear aggression has receded , the Government appreciate nuclear deterrence , do they admit that they were wrong to call for unilateral nuclear disarmament at the height of the threat from the Soviet Union at the time of the cold war , when the Deputy Prime Minister , the Foreign Secretary and the Prime Minister all supported the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament ?
		98. Will the Minister explain why European companies can apparently provide their workers with better conditions in terms of hours and minimum wages than this country 's employers ? Why is it that European companies do not regard looking after their workers well in terms of hours and wages as destroying competitiveness , but instead see it as a way to obtain good work from their workers ? Why is that ?
		99. Will the Prime Minister explain why a 65-year - old constituent of mine , who can not get a council home , has to pay £ 100 of her £ 570 a month rent because of his housing benefit reforms ? Why is this Prime Minister so much tougher on the vulnerable than he is on the powerful , with their excessive bonuses ?
		100. Will the Foreign Secretary explain the Government 's attitude to ethnic cleansing , murder , tyranny and oppression in Zimbabwe over the past eight years compared with their attitude to similar outrages in the Balkans ? Why is it , as hinted by Morgan Tsvangirai over the weekend , that this Government have consistently walked by on the other side in respect of Zimbabwe ?

However , what personal representations have the British Government made , either directly to the countries or through the World Bank , to ensure that countries in civil war meet the conditions of good governance ? They should be able to see how , by meeting the conditions of good governance and getting rid of the problems of civil war , they could be helped into the HIPC initiative , and that would improve the standard of living of their peoples .

		10. May I invite the right hon Gentleman to return to the original question and ask whether he is aware that the Church Commissioners have distributed information about private health schemes with salary cheques ?

If they have not made any such representations , will the right hon Gentleman assure me that he will make representations to British Rail to stop the axing of that vital service ?
		15. The Minister has made a number of references to the review of the Post Office and its services . I believe that it was originally intended that that review should be carried out immediately .

The Minister may be aware that this is a matter of particular interest to people in many constituencies , such as Maidenhead , who are concerned about the uncertainty that hangs over the future of their main post office .

		23. What representations have Her Majesty 's Government made to the Government of Zambia , and particularly the President , on behalf of ex - President Kaunda ? Is it not outrageous that , first , he has been banned from standing in Zambian elections and , secondly , as I understand it , he remains under house arrest ? If he has been charged , I do not believe that he has been brought to justice . That is thoroughly anti - democratic and something that we can not possibly support .

		25. I thank my hon Friend for that answer . Does he agree that this is a glitch in the Asian countries and that there will be continued growth in the region ?

		28. East Garforth primary school in my constituency has recently shown me the benefits of play therapy and early intervention at key stage 1 .

		29. Given the strong contribution made by the life sciences sector to UK exports—AstraZeneca ’s site in Macclesfield made a huge contribution to the company ’s £ 5 billion - worth of exports in 2015—will my right hon Friend tell the House what steps he is taking to work with the sector to ensure that medicines that are researched , developed and manufactured in the UK continue to have ease of access to European markets and global growth markets once the UK leaves the EU ?

What representations are being made to the Government of the Republic of Ireland to take drastic action to prevent those two organisations from expanding further ?
		31. Does the Secretary of State accept that the Government 's plans to accelerate the increase in pension age will come as a cruel blow to a whole generation of women in this country , because the financial reality of motherhood and family life makes it much harder for many women to build up a pension comparable to those of men ? What provision is being made for women aged 54 to 59 ?

		35. As my hon Friend knows , I was very pleased that Remploy in my constituency was removed from the list of closures , but its continuing existence depends on it securing contracts . It supplies health care products to England and to Scotland but has no contracts in Wales . I made every effort to secure those contracts , but what else can the Government do to ensure that the factory , which is very important to our area given the high percentage of disabled people , continues in existence ?
		36. What made the Government think they could get away with reducing the winter fuel payment by £ 100 by smuggling it through and not mentioning it in the Budget statement ? If they think that they have got away with it and that pensioners have not noticed , they should have been in my constituency at the weekend .
		37. Has the Minister heard stories of some very large payments of hundreds of thousands of pounds being made to some farmers in various parts of the United Kingdom ? Is he absolutely satisfied that the amounts of money that are being paid in some cases are warranted ?
		38. What representations have been made from either the Maryfield secretariat , the Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin or Dublin Government Ministers through the intergovernmental council to influence the findings of the Boundary Commission ?

Is my hon Friend aware that part of the improvement in manufacturing output in this country has been due to companies such as Avro International , which is based at Woodford in my constituency of Cheadle and has just recently made a marvellous export sale to Australia ? Will my hon Friend take the opportunity to congratulate the management and work force of Avro International on that breakthrough in the Australian market ?
		40.

		43. My hon Friend will know that a subset of the construction industry is the chemical engineering construction industry , which brings in several million pounds to the Exchequer from the work that it does overseas . Does he share the concern of the employers and the British Chemical Engineering Contractors Association that there is a substantial skills shortage in the industry ? The fact that the Engineering Construction Industry Training Board has been abolished means that there will be a further problem . What efforts will be made to put in place a system to encourage employers in the construction industry to train people for the future of the industry ?
		44. We learnt this week that a district judge is suing the Ministry of Justice , blowing the whistle on the rising number of death threats and the increasingly violent claimants that our judges are having to deal with day in , day out . Given that that comes so soon after the Lord Chief Justice ’s warning that judges face a rising number of challenging and emotionally charged cases , what action is the Minister taking to address these claims , or is this just another admission that his party ’s failed austerity policies have made our courts more dangerous , both for judges and for victims ?
		45. What representations have been made by the Government to the United States ' Government about the impact of any restrictions on our export of special steels to the United States ? Is the Minister aware that
		46. My right hon Friend will be aware of the report on comparative energy costs and the implications for British industry .

		47. What estimate has been made of the number of casualties that the NHS could deal with if there is war in the Gulf , and the number of staff who could be sent there without significantly affecting current levels of NHS activity and , thereby , waiting times ?
		48. I thank the Minister for his response . He is clearly aware of the problem of the conditions in which many single people serving in the armed forces live . Improvements have been made to officers ' quarters already at Plymouth , Devonport , but when can we expect the bulk of the improvements to living conditions for other service personnel to begin ? At the moment , they are living in conditions that are not fit for purpose for the 21st century .
		49. Is the Minister studying the recent election results in both Serbia and Kosovo ? What change have they made to the Government 's thinking about the troops being kept there ? Will he reassure the House that the commitment is not unlimited ? The troops have been in Bosnia for about eight years and it looks as though they could remain for a very long time to come .
		50. If at the London summit the Government had made an immediate announcement to cut defence spendng by over a quarter , what would have been the effect ?
		51. The London Welsh team is happy to congratulate the new Government team , at the same time as it commiserates with the team on the pitch on Saturday . If the Welsh Assembly or any of its Committees made a decision or passed a resolution that the Government 's failure to allocate British money to match objective 1 money was hindering private investment and therefore not achieving the best deal for the valleys and west Wales , what could Members of this House do to make sure that the Government deliver for Wales and its Assembly ?
		52. If it made sense to raise the tax on fuel for motor vehicles to have the effect on pollution that the Minister claims , why did it also make sense to reduce the tax on domestic fuel for heating , which causes even greater pollution ?
		53. Will the Minister confirm whether his Department is a member of Opportunity 2000 ? If it is , what progress has he made towards achieving the objectives of Opportunity 2000 , which aims to promote more women to leadership positions ?

		55. In constituencies such as mine , community transport run by charities—such as those in Bakewell and Eyam , Ashbourne and Amber Valley—provides a valuable and essential service for older people . What arrangements are being made for those services to benefit from the scheme ?
		56. Does my hon Friend agree that one of the advantages of privatising industries is that , in most cases they are now profitable and the Exchequer receives corporation tax from them whereas before privatisation , many of them made losses and cost the taxpayers money in subsidies ?
		57. As the Minister may know , during this Parliament I was involved in a meeting on hospice funding with the Prime Minister , during which he praised the hospice movement . Everyone knows that hospices depend on charitable giving and volunteers . In light of that , have the Government made any assessment of the impact of the recession on the hospice network ?

		59. Is the Secretary of State aware that cattle - truck commuting on the Kent line is now so bad that Connex South Eastern , the operator , is bringing in trains that have the seats and toilets removed to pack in more people ? He has failed to recognise that the problem is not one of new trains , but of infrastructure . All the plans put forward by the SRA so far suggest no foreseeable improvement in the next five years . What infrastructure improvements can be made within the next five years to give some hope to my commuters ?

		61. The Government have rightly set a target of ending child poverty by 2020 and halving it by 2010 . They have made enormous strides by reducing the numbers affected by 600,000 so far , but what will my hon Friend do for the lowest fifth of those with disposable incomes so that , by 2010 , we have made a significant difference , especially as it appears that , over the last year , the progress made has slowed ? Are there any new initiatives to ensure that we end child poverty in this country ?
		62. I congratulate the Minister on his appointment , but is he aware that both the Crown Estate and the Atomic Energy Authority have made applications for many offshore wind turbines on the Wash and off the Norfolk coast .

		65. On behalf of all multiple sclerosis sufferers in Northern Ireland , I thank the Minister for his announcement yesterday of the release of an additional £ 2 million for MS sufferers who need access to beta interferon . In two years , I shall come back to check that no one is on the waiting list . What targets has the Minister set to tackle child and adolescent psychiatry out - patient waiting times , which can extend to four years ? What efforts will be made to enhance work force capacity in that speciality ?
		66. I have heard nothing today to assure me that when parents seek the 30 hours free childcare they will be able to find them . I do not know if the Minister is aware that in Enfield since 2010 482 early - years childcare places have been lost and 114 providers have disappeared . When parents are looking for those places , I would be very surprised if they are there on the ground . What will the Minister do to ensure that he can meet the promises his Government have made ?

I ask that question because I read in the paper today that , for that posh gambling den , Lloyd 's , taxpayers in Britain will have to find £ 1.3 billion , including for 51 Tory Members of Parliament who made losses in that—
		76. I thank my right hon Friend for that answer . He will know that I am a technological imbecile , and that many customers of the Government do not have the skills to deal with such technology . What efforts have been made to make it user - friendly ?
		77. What changes in the proposals have been made as a result ?
		78. What contacts have been made between disability interest groups and governmental agencies to foster a better approach to the addressing of hate crime ?

		81. What changes to the unpublished 2003 analysis have been made as a result of the Government 's recent decision to move to three separate biometrics systems instead of two—as was originally planned—once they realised the high failure rate of separate biometrics ? Will the Government also ensure that before tomorrow 's debate , I receive replies to my six written questions—they are a week overdue—and to my five other questions , which have been outstanding for four days ?
		82. I congratulate the Secretary of State on these advances and the speed with which they have been accomplished . What preparations have been made to support NHS prosthetics centres , which will presumably take over support for these personnel when they re - enter civilian life ?
		83. I am sure that the whole House is delighted . Is the right hon Gentleman aware of the allegations that much of the land that has been seized by Mugabe 's thugs has been given to his cronies and members of his family ? If that is true , has he made specific representations on that point ?

		85. The Secretary of State says that the issue of FIFA governance has come up regularly in his conversations . Is it not masking the issue in Qatar , where workers continue to die ? In the study up to 2013 , more than 1,300 people were reported to have died . What representations have the Government made on the humanitarian crisis in that country resulting from the preparations for the World cup in Qatar in 2022 ?
		86. I am sure that the Minister will accept that a huge backlog of cases has built up and that waiting times are unacceptable . Is he aware that the Refugee Legal Centre has had to withdraw from all regions except London and the south - east because it simply can not cope with the numbers involved , and that the United Kingdom Immigrants Advisory Service is under enormous pressure ?

As the Minister 's first answer made it clear that a price differential has been a major cause of the substantial increase in sales of unleaded petrol , and as the Secretary of State is on record as saying that the market has a role to play in cutting the use of petrol across the market in the United Kingdom , by what figures does the Department currently estimate that petrol prices will increase over the next few years ?
		90. As the Minister made it clear in his initial reply that he has powers to supplement the restrictions recommended by the European Community , why does not he place a temporary ban on the importation of seed potatoes from the Netherlands ?
		91.

What further action do the Government propose to take to put pressure on the Norwegians ?
		96. Notwithstanding those generous figures and the supply of arms from this country , Indonesia has continued its policy of suppression against its own people , those in East Timor , and refugees in Papua New Guinea . What protest will be made ?
		97. What contribution will be made from Scottish resources—court fees paid by civil litigants in Scotland—to the running of a supreme court ?

	100 sample questions that were assigned type 4 (17745 total questions with this type) :
		1. Does my right hon Friend agree that , despite the significance of short - term events , the record in recent years demonstrates that Iraq represents one of the best markets for our exporters ? What results has he achieved through the representations that he made on behalf of British manufacturers when he visited Iraq ?
		2. I thank the hon Lady for that helpful reply . It is clear that a substantial proportion of these emissions—up to 16 per cent.—come from road traffic use . Given the Government 's projections of increased road traffic , there will be an increase in carbon dioxide emissions from cars until the year 2005 . The Minister 's answer showed that the causes include energy , transport , industrial and domestic sources , all of which are the responsibilities of different Ministries . What powers are available to her Department to co - ordinate all those sources and to ensure that there is one co - ordinated policy to deal with carbon dioxide emissions ? Does she agree that the problem should not be tackled by being dispersed among several Ministries ?
		3. What co - ordination exists between Government Department , to ensure that artistic considerations are properly supported when they go before inspectors at such inquiries ?
		4. It is estimated that South Yorkshire fire and rescue service will lose 100 firefighters ’ jobs . It is all very well for the Minister to say , “ We’ll pass the budget cuts down and somebody else has to take the responsibility . ” What happens if response times increase in South Yorkshire and the people in South Yorkshire , who are not a party to the decision that has been taken by the Government to cut the budgets , feel unsafe in their beds at night ?
		5. What initiatives have resulted from the increase in co - operation between LRT and BR ?
		6. In a recent Financial Times article on the subject , headed " MoD faces fresh crisis over funding " , which predicted a £ 1 billion shortfall for each year , a senior military figure is quoted as saying : " Every day at the MoD these days seems like a day at the dentist . " What on earth could he have meant ?
		7. What additional cash support will be targeted at SMEs ?
		8. I thank the Minister for that reply . It is very important that the perception that the North sea oil and gas sector is a sunset industry be laid to rest . There is at least 30—perhaps 50—years ' work still left in the North sea , but what could turn the industry into a sunset industry is our failing to get fresh blood into it , both offshore and onshore . While Cogent—the sector skills council—and the companies themselves clearly have some responsibility in this regard , they are looking to the Government for a steer . What might that steer be ?
		9. When the Government tried to get workers to exchange their rights for shares , we were told that 6,000 businesses would sign up . In the event , only six have even shown an interest—not 600 or 60 , only six . What went wrong ?
		10. I remind the House of my former profession of barrister . Eleven years ago , the Labour Government introduced the Woolf reforms , which changed all manners of process in the civil courts . What detailed proposals does the Minister have for the same telephone case management in criminal work , particularly post - not guilty pleas , and after - guilty pleas and sending matters for pre - sentence report ?
		11. What research is being conducted by the Minister 's Department to establish the relative importance of labour market flexibility and the use of the English language in the attraction of inward investment to Northern Ireland ?
		12. What progress is being made with the G20 in making the international banking industry more responsible by introducing such measures as a Tobin tax ?
		13. The safety of young people in our prison estate was , as we have heard , called into question by the “ Panorama ” programme about Medway secure training centre . What assurances can be provided that the safety of young people across the prison estate , not just in Medway , is being prioritised ?
		14. Most of the climate change debate tends to focus on mitigation and decarbonisation , but it is also important to work on adaption , such as how we respond to pressures on water supply . What plans are the Government putting in place at home and abroad to cope with the increasing pressure and also to promote new water filtration technologies , such as that promoted by FilterClear , an innovative company in my constituency that is creating green jobs and British exports , and promoting the more efficient use of water ?
		15. Countless past campaigns show that air strikes are seldom , if ever , decisive unless they are in support of credible ground forces . What credible ground forces are fighting Daesh in Syria , other than the Kurds , in limited areas , and Assad ’s , which are not also Islamist ?
		16. The Minister might have answered the question , but perhaps he could explain what his colleague , the Under - Secretary of State for Work and Pensions , the hon Member for Liverpool , Garston ( Maria Eagle ) , meant when she said in response to Question 5 that the pension credit was not means - tested . What on earth can she have meant ?
		17. What causes the Minister greater concern : the inadequate investigations into historical abuse at those schools and the lack of support for the victims , or the worry that the system he has just outlined is so full of holes that it is still possible for a dedicated abuser to carry on victimising children in those schools ?
		18. I welcome the Attorney - General ’s reply . As he will know , prosecuting sexual offences is very difficult , and such prosecutions are particularly difficult for children . When the guidelines were introduced , it was feared that not all the measures involved would be properly introduced everywhere . What steps are being taken to review the process and keep track of what happening , so that there can be a proper evaluation and good practice can be built on ?
		19. The plan to privatise British Waterways by the back door - that is what the Minister is planning - has been knocking about for decades . What makes him think it will work this time ?
		20. On a visit to HM Prison Send to see the women there in the RAPT—Rehabilitation for Addicted Prisoners Trust—programme , I saw the excellent work going on there . Those women 's greatest fear was of being released and slipping back into a life of drug - taking and then reoffending . What extra help can be offered by the two Departments , working together , to ensure that those women get the care that they need following their release ?
		21. What financial stress test will the Treasury impose before allowing the Department of Health to authorise general practitioner or clinical consortia ?
		22. British universities look with some envy on the endowment income that universities abroad , particularly in the United States , receive . What long - term attention is he paying to finding imaginative incentives at this stage in order to help British universities to begin the process of building up their endowment income ? At some stage in the future , it must play a larger part in funding than it does now .
		23. In 2010 , the Chancellor said that the budget deficit would be eliminated by 2015 . What went wrong ?

		28. What progress is being made along with Save the Children in trying to promote literacy skills among young females in many of the nation states where Save the Children operates ?
		29. At the beginning of the year , the DPP asked the Attorney General for an extra £ 50 million to plug the funding gap so that the CPS could properly prosecute complex matters , such as historical sex cases . He confirmed to this House that he was talking to the Treasury about this extra funding and that he thought it would understand the case he was making , but there was no mention in yesterday ’s autumn statement of this extra , special funding for historical sex cases . What went wrong ?
		30. I thank my hon and learned Friend for that reply . I am sure that , like me , he realises that in more serious cases , the delays before the final resolution is achieved often cause extra distress to the individuals or the families concerned . What overall reduction in delay will be offered by a speedy Crown court appearance ?
		31. I am interested in the Secretary of State ’s answer . In 2011 he announced that a million people would be claiming universal credit by April 2014 , when the true figure was just 6,000 . What went so badly wrong with his projections and what are his current milestones for the delivery of universal credit ?
		32. What progress is being made during Britain 's presidency of the EU with regard to getting the name of the Republic of Macedonia recognised , as opposed to the current anomaly of calling it the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ?
		33. East Hampshire district council has saved more than £ 5 million since 2010 by joining forces with Havant borough council and establishing a joint senior management team . What other such opportunities might exist elsewhere and what guidance has been given ?
		34. As my hon Friend knows , the main concern when the Clyde coastguard station was closed was to ensure that local knowledge was transferred to staff at Belfast and Stornoway . What monitoring has been carried out to ensure that that knowledge was transferred ?
		35. What early feedback has my right hon Friend received from the head of the UK Human Trafficking Centre about freshly commissioned research by regional intelligence units on the actual scale of sex trafficking in this country ?
		36. What existing human rights enjoyed by UK citizens under EU directives could not or should not be enshrined in UK law , if or when we leave the European Union ?
		37. What discussions have taken place with Health ministerial colleagues in devolved Administrations on the need to share best practice in diagnosis , analysis of biopsies and future treatments and care for those suffering from different forms and types of cancer ?
		38. Affordable and quality child care is essential to allow women to enter or stay in the work force . What additional investment are the Government putting into child care to ensure that women can make that choice if they wish ?
		39. I thank my right hon Friend for that response . The G8 agreement was welcome not so much for its detail as for the fact that the USA was party to it . With Australia making similar noises , perhaps we can focus on the developing world , and in particular countries such as Brazil , India and China . What steps are being taken to bring those countries on board , and what assistance can the USA provide in its proposed role as a bridge between the developed and the developing worlds ?
		40. I wonder whether my right hon Friend is aware that the recent report from the Transport Select Committee comments that : " Nearly a third of the franchises were no longer expected to function in the entrepreneurial , risk - taking way that was one of the fundamental justifications for private sector involvement in running train services , but simply to function as fee paid agents of the SRA " . What , therefore , is the justification for these services still being run by the private sector ?
		41. About 50 per cent . of the people of Afghanistan are under 18 , and about 60 per cent . of that age group die from preventable diseases . What steps are being taken , if there is a new infrastructure—this follows on from the question of the hon Member for Newcastle - under - Lyme ( Paul Farrelly ) —to get to Afghanistan the medicines , supplies and vaccines that the population requires and which we take for granted ?
		42. The problem is that that is just not happening , and perhaps the Secretary of State should accept that . For example , I saw a job advertised in my constituency today for a care assistant in a care home that has just closed down . Jobs are being wrongly categorised . Among sales assistants , we find jobs for account executives , for which qualifications are needed . What exactly is happening with Universal Jobmatch ?
		43. What work is being carried out by the Secretary of State 's Department to establish the cost benefits to British Railways of the switch from diesel multiple units to the rail bus ?
		44. The House is well aware of the danger of extremism on university campuses , and we understand that the Government are shortly to publish guidelines on the monitoring of extremist activity at our universities . What obligations and duties over and above those required of an ordinary UK citizen will be imposed on academics to report the activities of students ?
		45. The Leeds core strategy is currently being examined , with the council proposing what it admits is a hugely ambitious target of more than 70,000 houses and with the developers pushing for even more . Such huge targets would see up to 80 % of new homes in my constituency being built on greenfield or green - belt sites . What appeal mechanisms exist for my constituents , should the inspector approve such unrealistic targets ?
		46. What shall we live on when there is nothing left to privatise ?
		47. What estimates has the Minister made of the reduction in reoffending that will result from the changes that he proposes to make to the probation service ?
		48. Is the Minister aware that if he visited our Hackney social security offices he would see how London claimants continue to receive one of the worst services in the country and how Hackney residents suffer under his Poor Law regime ? I draw to his attention the case of Mrs. S. Moore of 156 Evelyn Court , Amhurst road , London E8 , who is disabled but was refused a grant for a pair of shoes because they were deemed to be of low priority . What sort of social security regime refuses disabled people money for shoes ?
		49. In the Secretary of State 's response to the resilience review , he stated that he was dissatisfied with previous performance and the level of disruption and that it would be sorted in time for this winter . What went wrong ? His response just now was not good enough . It is not good enough just to say that there has been a bit extra snow .
		50. The Minister ’s response to my hon Friend the Member for Harrow West ( Mr Thomas ) was to say that she had met charities on Monday . What was she doing all summer while the ramifications of this dog ’s breakfast of a lobbying Bill became clear ?
		51. What health problems are caused by first - cousin marriages , and how much does dealing with those problems cost the NHS each year ?
		52. What other measures will my hon Friend be introducing to help victims ?
		53. The coalition Government have set great store by encouraging stronger economic , cultural , religious and tourism links with India . With that in mind , there is constant lobbying for the reintroduction of direct flights from London to Gujarat , and especially Ahmedabad . What diplomatic efforts can Ministers launch to assist that campaign and get that much needed reform in place ?
		54. In December last year , this House passed a motion calling for a Bill to make urgent reforms to our deeply unfair extradition treaties . Nearly seven months later , there has been no Bill and no action . What makes the Prime Minister more uncomfortable : ignoring the will of the House for months on end or the plight of those facing imminent extradition ?
		55. In my advice surgery on Friday , a young couple came to see me in Darwen to say that they were £ 30 a week worse off for living together . It is a shameful legacy of the previous Government that people are worse off for living in couples and worse off when they go back to work . What this couple and everyone else in Darwen wants to know the answer to is : when will the universal credit end this situation ?
		56. I thank the Secretary of State for her response . More than 250,000 people have been displaced inside Mali and 170,000 Malians have fled to neighbouring countries . What additional assistance will her Department be providing to internally displaced people and refugees ?
		57. According to the National Audit Office , £ 600 million a year is lost through housing benefit fraud . Although we Conservatives welcome the introduction of flatter , more standard - rate elements to housing benefit , which must be sensible , it is being restricted to the private sector . I learned that , according to the Minister 's Department , such reform of the social rented sector will be achieved only toward the end of the decade . What on earth is he waiting for ?
		58. What proposals are the Government putting forward for further liberalisation of the internal market ?
		59. The gender pay gap in Coventry increased to 16.2 % in 2014 , up from 15 % the previous year . What targeted action are the Government taking to address the issue in areas such as mine where the gender pay gap has widened rather than narrowed in recent years ?
		60. My right hon Friend has probably heard much from lady Members representing London constituencies , who would like to work between 12 noon and 6 or 7 pm . What of the wives of Members who represent northern constituencies , who are working in the north and whose jobs do not permit them to come to London during the working week ? The fear of many hon Members , such as myself , who represent northern constituencies , is that if we have normal office hours we shall work for five days a week and the recesses will become shorter . That will mean that we shall have less time with our families and less time to spend with our constituents .
		61. What useful purpose is served by the continued existence of the PLA ?
		62. In my constituency , Tameside council has recorded an 8.3 per cent . increase in its recycling rate to 20.79 per cent . and Stockport has maintained its rate at 30 per cent . That means that , even with older facilities for recycling , many people are still either not using them as much as they could or not using them at all . What else can be done to encourage people to use the recycling facilities available and make the necessary environmental step change , particularly when the Waste and Resources Action Programme estimates that households could recycle up to 60 per cent . of their waste ?
		63. Everyone in the Chamber will benefit this year from electricity generated by coal burnt in the Bassetlaw , West Burton and Cottam power stations . What contingency agreement has been reached with EDF to ensure that in 2026 and beyond , when we do not have enough power available , the decision to close coal - based power stations can be reversed ?
		64. The east coast main line has returned £ 640 million to the public purse since 2009 . Sadly , private ownership has failed the travelling public of the east coast franchise . What possible public benefit can be gained by another wasteful and expensive round of refranchising , when east coast is already where the vast majority of the public want it , in public ownership ?
		65. What terms of reference has the Foreign Secretary set for the latest review of the Helmand road map and , crucially , how do they differ from those used two years ago ?
		66. I thank the Minister for that response , but the Government will know that I think it unwise to disband regular infantry battalions , such as 2nd Battalion the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers , before first being certain that the reservists can plug the gap . What objective measures exist for Parliament to gauge the progress of Government plans in this regard ?
		67. What happens to children under seven when they are the only ones sent to another village because there is no place for them in the local school ?
		68. With respect to the hon Member for Belfast , South ( Rev. Martin Smyth ) , Alzheimer 's sufferers would say that the problem is under - prescribing of the drugs that they need . In the west midlands , Aricept is not available on the NHS unless the patient is prepared to take part in a trial , which is unnecessary and merely aggravates the problem of postcode prescribing to which the Government have failed to deliver a solution . The Secretary of State said : It is important … that we achieve our aim , which is to ensure the introduction of more effective treatments into the national health service more quickly than has been possible before.—[Official Report , 10 November 1998 ; Vol . 319 , c. 136 . ] What went wrong ?
		69. What mechanisms exist for the CPS to communicate concerns with regard to the quality of interpretation both to the Law Officers and , indeed , to the Ministry of Justice ?
		70. What civil spin - off will result from the memorandum of understanding between the Government and the United States on the strategic defence initiative ?
		71. What induced the Minister to stand on its head the expansionist policy of his predecessor ?
		72. There are shocking reports of women affected by the changes introduced last April being left destitute . Many of them who have been on low pay all their lives where occupational pension schemes were not open to them have taken on caring responsibilities , saving this country lots of money . What immediate measures will the Government take to address this appalling situation and put these wrongs right ?
		73. What was the legal basis in international law for war against Yugoslavia , and if that did not require a UN resolution why does the Iraqi situation require one ?
		74. On Friday I visited Kirk Environmental , a company in Nelson that specialises in turning waste into electricity and usable biogas . It is experiencing rapid sales growth internationally , is recruiting more locally , and is at the forefront of the United Kingdom ’s transition to a low - carbon economy . What incentives is my right hon Friend providing to encourage such companies to invest more in Pendle and in the United Kingdom ?
		75. My right hon Friend is aware of the impact of conflict on developing countries . The availability of small and large weapons plays a part in fuelling that conflict . The UK is one of the largest producers of weapons and therefore has a responsibility . What mechanisms exist whereby my right hon Friend can engage in conversations with other Departments to ascertain what can be done to diversify away from that dangerous trade into more productive trades ? [ Interruption . ]
		76. What lessons have been learnt by the various EC countries with land frontiers which could be useful in dealing with the fraud that has taken place across our land frontiers with the Republic of Ireland ?
		77. I am happy to congratulate the Minister on his recent promotion . Last night , the Lord Chancellor made a speech on the proposed community legal service . What legal services will the community legal service be providing , first , for those who now qualify for legal aid , and , secondly , for middle - income Britain ?
		78. I thank the Minister for his answer . What lessons have been learnt from the EU mission in Somalia , which was relatively successful in keeping terrorists out of the security services , as opposed to a rather less successful exercise in Afghanistan in which many allied servicemen lost their lives as a result of terrorists entering the security services ?
		79. What local economic impact assessment is being undertaken on each of the bids coming in as part of the Defence Support Group sell - off ?
		80. What professional advice came from senior Royal Air Force commanders about the adequacy of air cover , and particularly the Phantoms ?
		81. I thank the Secretary of State for that reply . Today , in a committee room at the CBI , the Prime Minister indicated that the possible expansion of nuclear power would be part of the review of Britain 's energy requirements . What gives us the right to say that we can expand our nuclear energy , but at the same time tell other countries that they can not have it ?
		82. What annual reduction is expected in the number of licences to be issued by the traffic commissioners when the Transport Bill is enacted ?
		83. What recent discussions have Ministers had with chief constables about the growing menace of scrambler bikes being ridden recklessly on our roads , with the potential to cause great accidents , usually by young men wearing masks and without number plates ?
		84. The lack of serious political engagement in the current round of talks , which is characterised by the fact that parties are still squabbling over whether or not they are attending the talks , does not bode well for the future . Meanwhile , in my constituency , a young man has been hospitalised with head injuries , police officers have been injured , and pensioners have been terrified in their own homes after three successive nights of violence . What sanctions will the Secretary of State impose on the parties that fail to show the will to resolve the outstanding issues in this process ?
		85. I am sure that the Secretary of State is aware of my concern about public safety in Edinburgh—that of both visitors and residents—at the time of the G8 summit . What proposals are being discussed to reduce the risks to those travelling to Edinburgh and to those affected by major events in Edinburgh over the week , to ensure that they are safe at the end of the protest ?
		86. Yesterday , the gentleman who gave evidence to the Select Committee chaired by the hon Member for Glasgow South West ( Mr Davidson ) on behalf of the Yes Scotland campaign for separation refused to state categorically that his campaign would abide by the advice of the Electoral Commission . What sanctions can be imposed on a Government , a Parliament or a campaign that blatantly refuses to take the commission ’s advice ?
		87. What exactly would be achieved by air strikes ?
		88. One of the concerns that my constituents express when faced with the decline in value of their pension funds relates to how they could live off the annuity that the funds would purchase . What thought have the Government given to relaxing the ways in which such funds can be used , so that pensioners could maximise their income and thus reduce their dependency on means - tested benefits ?
		89. Our future aircraft carriers are being built by our Scottish allies . What happens to the construction of those carriers if Scotland declares independence and does not contribute to the cost ?
		90. What happens when a local neighbourhood seeks to protect a statutory designation such as green - belt land against the wishes of a local authority , particularly in metropolitan areas where such land is at a premium ?
		91. What useful purpose will be served by this meeting ?
		92. What mechanisms exist in the Secretary of State 's Department to ensure that that regime , or any other inspection regime or regulatory burden , does not weigh down harder on British business than similar regulatory regimes do in other EU member states ?
		93. Small businesses will be greatly helped if they can recruit people with the skills that they need . At Oakdale comprehensive school I saw for myself last week that young people are being prepared well for the workplace and given good IT skills . What initiatives exist to ensure that we have strong school - business links , so that when we come out of the economic downturn Welsh companies are certain that they will have a strong and skilled work force from whom to recruit ?
		94. This week , we heard that the problem of climate change may be even worse than previously thought , and that the Government will not meet their targets . Later this month , the Government plan to close four out of the eight eco laboratories that monitor climate change . What happened to joined - up government ?
		95. What were the terms of the apology proffered by Mr. Caspar Weinberger about the visit to British firms—unauthorised , it seems—by Mr. Clarence Robinson ?
		96. I fully support the plans to introduce television cameras in courts to improve transparency . What plans are there to improve transparency in the Prison Service so that we can see exactly what work and activity have been undertaken in each prison so that justice can be seen to be done ?
		97. The morale of both our reserve and full - time forces , and of their families back home , is undoubtedly critical at a time of conflict . I am sure that the Minister is aware of the disquiet of many members of the service community about the high cost of sending care packages to the Gulf . What moves is he backing to try to deal with that problem , which is important for both the full - time and reserve forces ?
		98. What preparations and plans exist for the possibility of a major aircraft failure or collision over central London ? That is increasingly possible because of the intensification of the use of Heathrow airport and the aviation industry 's wrong demand for an extra runway at Heathrow .
		99. The election of Barack Obama has been greeted with enthusiasm around the world , in part because of his acceptance of the importance of tackling climate change . What discussions are planned with the incoming US Government to promote that agenda globally ?
		100. Following on from the previous question , 3,000 disadvantaged children in my Banbury constituency also benefit from the pupil premium . What other measures has the Minister thought about to promote targeted spending , to help to increase fairness in education ?

	100 sample questions that were assigned type 5 (30592 total questions with this type) :
		1. I am grateful to my hon Friend for recording that success story , but the steel industry has suffered from two huge problems : first , the high rate of sterling inherited from the previous Government and , secondly , the fanatical anti - manufacturing culture of the Tory years . However , is he aware of some little rays of sunshine on the horizon ? First , in its estimate for the end of the year , Goldman Sachs predicts the pound coming down significantly against the euro , which is good news for steel , although my hon Friend should spend his wage - frozen salary on holidays abroad now , rather than wait for a weaker pound in nine months ' time . Secondly , in Asia , prices are being posted higher and order books are picking up . Will my hon Friend consider three specific issues ? First , will he ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer to put somebody from manufacturing on the Monetary Policy Committee ? Secondly , will he look harder and faster at excessive electricity prices ? There is no doubt that we need harmonisation with Europe on that matter , because we need lower electricity prices . Thirdly , will he agree to meet representatives of the industry to discuss those problems in the near future ?
		2. As my hon Friend knows , agricultural support before we joined the Community was paid through taxation . Now agricultural support is paid through the common agricultural policy and through the infinitely higher price that Community produce sustains compared with world market prices . Effectively , that is a food tax on the consumer . I am sure that my hon Friend would like eveybody to know what the factors are in the argument . Will she develop that theme so that we may know from week to week and month to month what food tax consumers in this country are paying ?
		3. Will the Minister not be persuaded by the arguments of commercial interests , many of which are profit hungry , and remember that all the studies prove that the best , the most effective and the healthiest way in which to feed infants is the natural way ?
		4. The Secretary of State knows that the national lottery provides financial support for many of our grass - roots sports initiatives that encourage young people to participate in sporting activity . Will she therefore rule out any further raids on the national lottery to pay for overspends on the London Olympics ?
		5. The families of those who have lost loved ones through dog attacks , chief police officers , the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals , Battersea Dogs Home and hon Members from both sides of the House support the introduction of dog control notices . Tomorrow , Labour Members on the Committee considering the Anti - social Behaviour , Crime and Policing Bill will call for their introduction . Will the Government back us ?
		6. The Minister will know how successful the social investment bond at Doncaster and Peterborough prisons has been in tackling recidivism . Indeed , he , the Secretary of State and his predecessors visited the prisons . Will he recapitulate his commitment to social investment bonds as a means of tackling reoffending across the penal estate ?
		7. Will the Secretary of State give an assurance that the fiasco of the past few months , with beds closing throughout the country and urgent cases not being treated , will not be repeated at the end of the next financial year ?
		8. There were vacancies in the multi - storey block of flats that the Minister visited in Sighthill in my constituency , but when the concierge system was introduced there was great demand for those flats . Will the Minister co - operate with local authorities to introduce concierge systems for multi - storey dwellings as quickly as possible ? People are entitled to peace and quiet in their homes and to be free from vandalism .
		9. The Deputy Prime Minister will know that three out of the four nations within the United Kingdom now enjoy some form of devolution ; the one that does not enjoy any devolution , effectively protected by statute , is England . Will he engage with local government at the right moment to discuss how devolution can be made effective through local government , and will he also engage with the Select Committee , which is due to report on this very matter at the end of this month ?
		10. Will my right hon and learned Friend help our farmers ' representatives to get across to their continental counterparts the fact that continental Governments ' actions and statements during this difficult period have damaged their domestic beef markets more than our Government 's statements and actions have damaged the market here ? It is important for continental farmers and continental Ministers to realise that fact , because once they do they will have a much greater incentive to lift the beef ban and to take different action . The damage to their markets has been much greater , whereas our Government 's actions have helped to protect the domestic beef market here , despite the scaremongering to which my right hon and learned Friend referred .
		11. I also welcome the hon Gentleman to the Front Bench . Although the inquiry was carried out in private , I think that the hon Gentleman is aware that a pledge was given by me that the report would be published . Therefore , there would be widespread indignation in Scotland if the report were censored in any way . Will he therefore repeat the assurance given by the Under - Secretary of State for Scotland on television the other day that the report would be published in full ?
		12. Will the United Kingdom Government be supporting the United States Government in their attempt to get a renewal of the United Nations Security Council resolution that exempts US troops from the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court—and if so , why ?
		13. Will my right hon Friend warn the so - called Ulster Loyalists who threaten to make the Province ungovernable that they could succeed where IRA terrorism has singularly failed over the last 12 years in persuading the British people and Parliament to end this country 's commitment to the defence of Ulster ?
		14. It is understandable that the Secretary of State does not want to comment on every speculation that we hear about top - up fees , even—or perhaps especially—those floated by his own Cabinet colleagues . Will he , however , rule out at least one of them , which came in briefing papers from his own Department ? It is the idea that every student , including those from poor families , should be paying fees . That sits very oddly with every other part of the Government 's rhetoric . Will the right hon Gentleman disown that idea now ?
		15. Some years ago , Parliament changed the law to allow members of the Anglican clergy to stand for election to this House , which has enabled my hon Friend the Member for Rhondda ( Chris Bryant ) to become a Member of Parliament . Will the Government ’s proposals for an elected second Chamber permit the Anglican clergy to stand for election , and has the Church considered that it might make sense for the Anglican representation in the second Chamber to be elected , so that women as well as men could offer themselves for election ?
		16. The Aberdeen and Grampian chamber of commerce oil and gas survey showed that the industry believes that more needs to be done to increase exploration drilling , without which there will be no new projects . Will the Minister engage with the industry to develop proposals to incentivise exploration and protect long - term employment ?
		17. The Secretary of State 's Department has been looking at the economics of energy in detail for some time . Will the right hon Gentleman name any British nuclear power station that has been built on time , on budget and without any taxpayer or consumer subsidy ? If he can not do so , perhaps he will name such a nuclear power station somewhere in the world at any time , ever .
		18. The chair of the South London Healthcare NHS Trust has written to the Secretary of State to correct inaccurate information given out by the Department of Health regarding the trust ’s performance . [ Interruption . ] Instead of barracking me , would the Secretary of State— [ Interruption . ] Instead of shouting at me now , it is a shame that the Secretary of State did not meet the local MPs when he had the opportunity . Will he distance himself from the false information put out by unattributable sources in his Department , which will undermine the performance of the hospital and shows little respect for the health service workers who are working to improve services ?
		19. Will the Prime Minister dampen down the hysteria in this country about Irish - American support for violence in Northern Ireland by recognising that the vast majority of Irish - Americans , of whom there are 44 million , do not support violence in Northern Ireland and that opposition to it is forcefully , strongly and constructively expressed by their political leaders , such as Speaker O'Neill , Senator Kennedy and Senator Moynihan ?
		20. As my right hon Friend knows , best practice in waste management is recycling . As she mentioned , the Government have a good record on that , but we could improve it even more . Local authorities ' recycling targets are measured not by product but by weight ; if we had material - specific targets , recycling could be improved , as it could if we also removed the distinction between the collection of domestic and commercial waste in some circumstances . Will the Minister revisit those issues ?
		21. The Prime Minister is well aware that our armed forces in Helmand province in Afghanistan are involved in a desperately dangerous mission , and are putting their lives on the line every hour of every day . Apparently , Brigadier Lorimer , who takes command of British forces next spring , has said that he will need more soldiers , Warrior armoured vehicles , tanks , artillery pieces and helicopters . Will the Prime Minister honour the commitment that he gave to the people of this country in a television interview , when he said that the Army will get whatever it needs to ensure a successful outcome to its mission ?
		22. The Government ’s position is not , however , supported by the Farmers Union of Wales . Given that €400 million are pumped into the rural Welsh economy , convergence funding for west Wales and the valleys has had a huge impact . Will my hon Friend be cheering on Nick or Nigel in this evening ’s debate ?
		23. I thank the Deputy Prime Minister for that answer . Will he be appearing on television to support the views of the Foreign Secretary , who is seeking ways deliberately to block business in Europe , or the views that he has expressed in the past and which are shared by the Chancellor of the Exchequer about playing a constructive role in the European Union ?
		24. Market Field school is in the neighbouring constituency of my hon Friend the Member for Harwich and North Essex ( Mr Jenkin ) . It caters for children with special needs from both our constituencies and from the Clacton constituency . Will the Minister agree to meet the three of us to consider why Essex county council ’s promise—made by the previous leader to the head teacher , Mr Gary Smith—has not been carried out ?
		25. Will the Secretary of State set out her objectives for next week ’s meeting of the Global Partnership for Effective Development Co - operation and say what her Department ’s work with the private sector will achieve ?
		26. I hope that that promise will be delivered . Will the Minister enlighten us about when he will deliver the promised licensing law reform rather than just the half - baked attempt on licensing for new year 's day ?
		27. The Minister will be aware that although the NHS is one organisation , trusts seem to operate as silos . Will he convene a meeting of all the trusts in the Colchester area to discuss the future of the Haven project ?
		28. Since 23 June , there has been a significant depreciation of sterling and two announcements of major investments in UK motor manufacturing . The prospects for investment in UK manufacturing more widely are now much improved . Will the Chancellor be seeking to ensure that the more sensible exchange rate welcomed by Lord Mervyn King , among others , is sustained ?
		29. While I am sure that Mr. Miller did not welcome the Secretary of State 's announcement last week , I certainly welcome his rather belated rendezvous with reality . Will he be discussing with Mr. Miller and others responsible for the generation of electricity how the Government intend to plug the hole which must now appear in the Government 's energy policy , having predicted 10 nuclear power stations in their 1979 manifesto ? Will the right hon Gentleman be increasing resources for the development of alternative fields , renewable resources and energy efficiency , and in particular reversing the cuts in his own energy efficiency office ?
		30. Children can remain in foster care until they are 21 , while those in residential care have to leave at 18 , which creates a truly unfair system . I have organised for MPs to pledge their support tomorrow to show that we care equally about all looked - after children . Will the Minister sign the pledge ?
		31. Will the Deputy Prime Minister unequivocally condemn the remark made yesterday by his right hon and learned Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer , when he said : This bottom 10 per cent . always drive me up the wall " ? Will he further apologise to that bottom 10 per cent . , who have seen a real fall of 17 per cent . in their living standards since the Conservative Government took office ?
		32. Will the boon that has been suggested for council tenants be extended to tenants of housing associations or quangos , such as the Northern Ireland Housing Executive ?
		33. I am delighted that the Minister has agreed to visit the Princess Royal hospital in my constituency , and I would be delighted to welcome the hon Member for Telford ( David Wright ) as well . Will the Minister improve staff morale at the hospital by stating categorically that the accident and emergency ward will not be downgraded from a consultant - led ward to a nurse - led ward ?
		34. Will the Prime Minister inquire into what is happening regarding the Stormont estate ? I understand that a decision has been taken to sell off that beautiful estate , which is used by all the people of Northern Ireland , whatever their religion or beliefs . I think that the Prime Minister should look into the widespread rumours of the sell - off .
		35. Will my right hon and learned Friend consider introducing legislation dealing with nuclear shelters as they exist , and have existed for many years , in Switzerland ?
		36. Will my hon Friend remove the impression given by the hon Member for Birmingham , Ladywood ( Ms. Short ) that these searches are restricted to Republican prisoners ?
		37. The latest crime figures show that personal crimes of robbery , burglary and theft have gone up by 11 % in the past year—the largest increase in more than a decade . Contrary to what the Home Secretary has just said , the independent inspectorate of policing has said that a 10 % cut in police numbers will lead to a 3 % increase in property crime . Quite frankly , the Home Secretary should be cutting crime , not police officers . Will she urgently revisit plans to cut 16,000 police from our streets ?
		38. Will the Foreign Secretary prioritise speaking with the Indian authorities about the case of the ex - soldier Ray Tindall from Hull who , while working on a US pirate patrol vessel , was arrested for straying into Indian waters ? As I understand it , the court case has been constantly adjourned . His family are desperate to find out when he will be returned to the UK.
		39. The Government have now admitted that they got police funding for London wrong with their U - turn on Metropolitan police funding and a £ 90 million bung for Boris ’s re - election campaign , yet the Met is not the only force facing pressures from the Olympics and other issues . Will the Minister now reverse the cuts to other forces , such as West Midlands , Greater Manchester , Humberside and Merseyside police , all of which are cutting the number of officers ? Cut crime , not the police .
		40. Will my right hon Friend talk to Railtrack about improving the western approach to Nottingham station ? That improvement is essential if the local rail services are to be developed by making use of the old colliery lines in constituencies such as mine in Gedling .
		41. My hon Friend will be aware that many people in Wales want to take advantage of the opportunities that the Government are offering , but that they may need mentoring . Will he appoint somebody in his Department , perhaps by seconding a civil servant , to assist people who have ideas to take forward the big society ?
		42. Will the Prime Minister abide by the result of the referendum in Gibraltar tomorrow ?
		43. Will the Minister name and shame the five worst local authorities that have the largest number of disabled people who are affected by the spare room subsidy removal but are not using the discretionary funds that the Government have given them ?
		44. On the subject of dentistry , in February 2008 , the Secretary of State said : " Access to NHS dentistry is getting better all the time."—[ Official Report , 5 February 2008 ; Vol . 471 , c. 772 . ] I do not think my constituents , constituents around the country or dentists are quite certain what figures the Secretary of State was referring to . Recent figures since his contribution in 2008 show that nearly 1 million British members of the public no longer have access to NHS dentistry . Will he now retract his comments and scrap this ludicrous contract ?
		45. I congratulate the Secretary of State on obtaining extra money for the assisted places scheme , thus enabling the imminent Labour Government to reduce class sizes more quickly . Will she now fight for equivalent funding for the 86,000 extra children who are to be in the system this year and the 60,000 who are to be in it next year on the same basis as she proposes to subsidise the independent schools under the assisted places scheme ?
		46. During this Parliament , workers ' rights have been defended , protected and strengthened , whereas during the 18 years of Conservative Government , workers ' rights were massively attacked . Will Operation Gangmaster be targeted at agricultural gangmasters who exploit illegal immigrants ? According to a recent " Panorama " programme , forced labour camps have been set up . Will the Government tackle those problems ?
		47. Will conditions be attached to the withdrawal of our provincial reconstruction team in Helmand , such as an increase in the capacity of provincial government in the region , or will the team simply be withdrawn in line with the removal of combat troops by 2015 ?
		48. Will my right hon Friend publish all the evidence , some of it garnered in response to hostile questions from Opposition Members , which shows beyond any doubt whatever that a reduction in the top rate of income tax has increased the proportion of tax paid as a total from the top 10 per cent . , and that any proposal to increase the top rate of income tax will produce a shortfall in revenue which can then be obtained only from middle - income earners ?
		49. The closure of many magistrates courts was based on the argument that centralised courts would be provided with the most modern facilities . Although I welcome the Minister 's answer , it does not tally with the information that I have received from the north Essex magistrates bench , which has received information from the Essex magistrates courts committee . Will the Minister therefore convene a meeting of the local magistrates , the Essex magistrates courts committee and Colchester borough council , so that we can flush out exactly what is going on ? I hope that what the Minister said is correct . If it is , we can get on with building the new courthouse .
		50. One of the great successes of the previous Government— [ Laughter . ] One of the great successes of the previous Government was to encourage the establishment of pension funds , which now exceed those in the rest of Europe put together . The present Government responded with a £ 5 billion annual raid on pension funds , so the savings ratio is going down and the average 30-year - old must put away a further £ 200 a year to stay level . That policy is wicked and counterproductive . It was not forecast in the Labour manifesto . Will the Government withdraw it ?
		51. The recent London - Somali conference reflected the commitment of successive Governments to that region , but the communiqué spoke of co - ordinated ground action , and air strikes were also mooted . Will the Secretary of State rule out British military action in Somalia , including ground troops and air strikes ?
		52. I thank my hon Friend for his reply . Sussex ME and Chronic Fatigue Society works tirelessly to assist the 6,000 adults and children across the county who suffer from the disease , and several of those people have been contacted about the success of the lightning treatment . Will he assess that treatment , in conjunction with the bodies that he has mentioned , and monitor how successful it is ?
		53. Will the Minister comment on my local authority ’s plans for the youth service ? It is cutting its budget by half , closing four of the seven permanent youth clubs to obtain their sites for market sale , and now plans to sell free - for - use sports pitches in a public park to a private company for commercial letting .
		54. Will the Minister relax regulations on investments by foundations and trusts to empower them fully to support innovations such as social impact bonds ?
		55. In my constituency planners are under external pressure to develop green - field sites , which is unpopular with local people . Will Government guidelines be applied fiercely to ensure that infill and derelict sites are used first , and that guidelines are strictly enforced in green - field areas ?
		56. I thank my hon Friend for that answer , which will be welcomed by beef processors such as the Birds Eye factory in my constituency . Will he now focus his efforts on trying to get exports of this beef resumed because that would help farmers as well as people who make their living producing burgers ?
		57. Traditionally , health authorities have been allocated money for prevention and money for treatment and cure . Everybody must get the prevention message across when the budget effectively goes into the primary care trust pot , but the incidence of HIV varies around the country . It is low in my area , but extremely high in parts of London . Will areas with a high incidence be vired more money to cope with the larger problem or will they be expected to manage on the existing budget ?
		58. When the Secretary of State was in opposition , he repeatedly and convincingly made the case that delays to projects ended up costing the UK taxpayer more and put at risk our prized skills base . Will he rule out any such delay in the Trident successor programme or anything else in the strategic defence review ?
		59. Hopwood Hall college in my constituency delivers vocational programmes to learners throughout Heywood , Middleton and Rochdale—all areas of high deprivation . The college capital programme has had to be put on the back burner because of the funding crisis at the Learning and Skills Council . Will the Prime Minister have a look at the specific problem for me , and perhaps designate the appropriate Minister to meet the college principal , the local authority and me to see if we can get ourselves out of this mess ?
		60. Will the Prime Minister now unfreeze child benefit and restore the 70p cuts that she has made in the past two years ?
		61. Will the Minister estimate the proportion of subsidies for Harlands and Shorts which are actually going to subsidise employment in Scotland and England ?
		62. But the Government are not helping people with debt ; they are pushing families further into debt . Council taxes have almost doubled over the past 11 years , petrol now costs £ 1.20 a litre , with another 2p increase in the pipeline , and the vehicle excise duty increases will hit families living in Wales who have family cars . Will the Secretary of State lobby the Prime Minister to scrap both those taxes ?
		63. The Minister will know that many private sector landlords are reluctant to accept people on housing benefit as tenants . Will he initiate discussions with local authorities and representatives of the private sector to overcome that resistance and to make sure that the private rented sector plays a much fuller part in meeting the needs of those with housing problems ?
		64. Among those who know of the situation , there is a widespread perception that the Government are deliberately dragging their feet because of the strong tendency among armed forces personnel not to vote Labour . Will the Minister therefore pledge to ensure that by May this year the number of members of the armed forces registered to vote will be the same as in May 1997 ?
		65. The Minister will be aware that for the UK to be competitive , good corporate governance is essential . Auditing is a central part of that . My right hon Friend will also know of the campaign by the big four accountancy firms to cap auditor liability . Will she cast a wary eye over it before the Government give in to this case of special pleading ?
		66. Will my right hon Friend cause to be translated into many languages the transcript of our right hon Friend the Prime Minister 's interview with Mr. Brian Walden on Sunday ? Will he then cause it to be circulated to everyone in Europe , particularly those involved in the ERM ?
		67. At Question Time yesterday , in reply to the hon Member for North Tayside ( Mr. Swinney ) , and at Question Time the previous Wednesday , the Prime Minister struck a note of cautious optimism . He said that there was a reasonable prospect of success at the May standing committee . Will my right hon Friend throw a little more light on that ?
		68. Ever since the time of Adam , local government has complained about the amount of central Government funding for local services . Will my right hon Friend , my right hon Friend the Prime Minister , the Cabinet and representatives of local government sit around a table in the near future and thrash out a system that is understandable and which targets money so that it goes where it is needed ?
		69. From correspondence , the hon Gentleman is aware of the problems with the major restoration of the parish church in Wem . We have trouble with SITA in organising a refund of the landfill tax . Will the hon Gentleman personally organise a meeting of all the interested parties , so that that long - standing problem can be resolved ?
		70. Prime Minister , I have just had a debate in Westminster Hall on the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland ’s report into the Loughinisland massacre , in which six men were shot dead by the Ulster Volunteer Force in a period of direct rule in my constituency . I received a letter from her predecessor in which he acknowledged this unspeakable evil and assured me that the Government accept the police ombudsman ’s report and that any allegations of police misconduct will be taken seriously . Will the Prime Minister detail what action she will take to ensure that prosecutions are pursued , that an apology is forthcoming from the Government and that compensation is provided for the lives lost ?
		71. At present , the way in which business rates work imposes rates on empty properties . This is holding back many urban regeneration schemes . Will the new Secretary of State therefore reform the way in which those rules work before the whole scheme is transferred to local authorities ? That would make a crucial difference to the modernisation of our housing estates in particular .
		72. That is a matter of great comfort . Ministers have previously said that they have no intention of entering an exchange rate mechanism between sterling and the euro . Will the Chief Secretary now rule out absolutely the question of an exchange rate mechanism prior to any arrangement for joining the euro ?
		73. I thank the Secretary of State for that answer . Will the Government be supporting the Live Music Bill of my hon Friend the Member for Bath ( Mr. Foster ) , which will assist venues that do not serve alcohol , such as village halls and school halls , in that regard ?
		74. Many jobs today require a university degree , yet compared with the position on funding employees ' vocational training , there is no equivalent tax shield for employer contributions to higher education . Will the Chancellor explore changes to tax rules to encourage voluntary contributions from employers towards their graduate recruits ' higher education ?
		75. Will the Home Secretary be bringing forward a list of the number of policy U - turns he has been forced to make since announcing his 27-point plan ?
		76. Will the Government exert all possible influence to try to reduce the risks of a nuclear conflict that could devastate the subcontinent and beyond ?
		77. My right hon Friend had a very successful breakfast meeting with business men in Warwickshire on Friday . Will he therefore repeat , for the benefit of the House , the points that he made about the social chapter and the damage that it would do to employment and prosperity in the United Kingdom ?
		78. Will my hon Friend quantify the savings to this country as a result of a number of relevant programmes being run by the Government ?
		79. A military veteran living in Carmarthenshire has been told by NHS Wales that he has to wait up to eight months for urgent mental health treatment . The Veterans Association tells me that in parts of England the wait would be seven to 10 days . Will the Secretary of State sort out this problem on behalf of Welsh veterans ?
		80. Will the Secretary of State shed more light on reports in the press today that the Government are seeking to change the definition of domestic violence ?
		81. I have given the Prime Minister prior notice of this question . Last week at Prime Minister 's Question Time , I challenged the accuracy of the statement made by the right hon Gentleman to the House about Railtrack on 19 December , when he said : " However , the longer the administrator 's work has gone on , the more financial difficulties he has uncovered."—[ Official Report , 19 December 2001 ; Vol . 377 , c. 288 - 9 . ] Since last week , the administrator has again given evidence to the Transport Sub - Committee of the Select Committee on Transport , Local Government and the Regions at which he contradicted that statement by the Prime Minister . I have sent the right hon Gentleman a transcript of that evidence . Will he today accept that his statement was not correct and will he withdraw it ?
		82. Thank you , Mr Speaker . Will the National Crime Agency specifically target the organised criminal gangs that are engaging in subterfuge and in the organised criminal activity of fuel laundering along the border areas of Northern Ireland ?
		83. Will my hon Friend contemplate the fact that in order to achieve the glory of the Maastricht union , the French are willing to forgo drinking French wine and we should ensure that we drink our whisky and that they do not drink their wine ?
		84. People convicted of sex offences against children are supposed to face a prison sentence . Will the Prime Minister retire judges who fail to imprison convicted paedophiles ?
		85. Will my right hon Friend work with Staffordshire county council to tackle the long - term congestion problems in and around Stafford that are caused by , among many reasons , diversions from the M6 when it is blocked ?
		86. My right hon Friend will be aware of the recent report by the Royal College of Radiologists , which shows clearly that radiotherapy is a cost - effective treatment for the management and cure of cancers . He will also be aware that the treatment can not be equally accessed throughout the country , which leads to waiting time and waiting list increases . Will he campaign with me for the purchase of equipment , such as linear accelerators and for trained staff to rectify that anomaly ?
		87. In 2010 , 1,019 individuals were given indeterminate sentences . Will the Minister assess the rehabilitation strategies for those currently serving indeterminate sentences ?
		88. I am grateful to the hon Gentleman for his reply . He will be aware that the report revealed that more than 100,000 of Glasgow 's citizens were not registered . That is three times the entire electorate of Orkney and Shetland . Will the Electoral Commission request an urgent meeting with the Secretary of State for Scotland to ensure that proper resources are now provided as a matter of urgency in order to resolve that disgraceful position ?
		89. Will my hon Friend issue guidelines to family practitioner committees to avoid the difficulty under the cost rent scheme when permission for a new doctor 's surgery is first given and later withdrawn ?
		90. Will the Minister convene discussions before the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill completes its passage through the House to examine whether changes to it are necessary to tackle the extent to which prostitution is rife and is using trafficked women ?
		91. In my constituency , many people are concerned about the impact of fracking on their area , as it has a direct effect on their lives . Will the Secretary of State present a detailed health and environmental impact assessment of fracking to the conference in Paris ?
		92. Last week the Prime Minister said there was no question of cutting the size of the Army . That answer , as he must know , was quite wrong . Will he now correct it ?
		93. Will the Minister assuage the natural worries of legitimate firearms owners that they may be paying for inefficiencies in the police administration of the system by publishing the Ernst and Young report before he gives his report on the increase of the fees ?
		94. The Minister will therefore know that 80 % of the households in Scotland affected by the bedroom tax are the home of someone with a disability . He knows that there is a mismatch between the available housing stock and the needs of tenants , and he knows that Scottish MPs , including Government Back Benchers , voted overwhelmingly against this policy . Will the Government now lift the legal restrictions on discretionary housing payments to allow the Scottish Government to mitigate the impact of this nonsense of a policy ?
		95. The expression " no part of this Government 's objectives " will be taken as a slightly disappointing reaction by the National Farmers Union and farmers . Does the Secretary of State not accept that 75 per cent . of continental farms receive less than Euro5,000 a year , but 43 per cent . of British farms are of a size whose subsidy will be heavily slashed under current proposals ? Will she not toughen up her stance on this matter ? Will she not fight for British farmers who have already been devastated , and many of whom are suicidal ?
		96. At the 2005 Labour party conference , the current Prime Minister announced his ambition to halve child poverty by 2010 . Will that target be met ? A simple yes or no will suffice .
		97. Will he resign ?
		98. The Secretary of State has said that she will resign if the high - speed main line goes through her constituency . Will she resign if she fails to secure the electrification of the line to south Wales ?
		99. I greatly welcome the letting of the main contract for the expansion of MOD Stafford to enable it to receive two more Signals regiments . Will the main contractor be encouraged to work with local SMEs which offer value for taxpayers ’ money ?
		100. I understand that we do not have the figures for January 2003 in that case , but I thank the Solicitor - General for her answer . At Question Time last month , she hinted that there was scope for greater co - operation between the Crown Prosecution Service and the police in North Yorkshire to prosecute people for violent crimes , burglaries and other crimes after they had been detected . Will she elaborate on how she would like such further co - operation to develop ?

	100 sample questions that were assigned type 6 (29050 total questions with this type) :
		1. Is not the major cause of that imbalance between current and capital expenditure in the public sector the enormous increase in expenditure on unemployment benefits and the revenue foregone as a result of massive unemployment ? Is it not true that if , let us say , £ 1,000 million were put into a construction investment programme , the net cost to the public sector borrowing requirement would be less than £ 400 million ? Why do the Government not accept that there should be a shift of this kind from revenue costs to capital investment ?
		2. Notwithstanding the unsatisfactory nature of that reply , does the Minister accept that the positive proposals that have been made by his right hon and learned Friend the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster should not have been thwarted by his Department , that guidelines should be developed to ensure that local labour is used for inner - city regeneration plans , otherwise not only will local democracy be bypassed but local needs and the local communities will be bypassed ? Just as the initiatives of his right hon Friend the Member for Henley ( Mr. Heseltine ) failed after the riots in 1982 , does the Minister not accept that his proposals may seem largely irrelevant and will end up as window dressing ?
		3. Does the Chancellor of the Exchequer accept that inflation , as measured by the RPI , is only one measure of the inflationary tendencies within the economy ? Does he accept that the huge deterioration in our trade account and the fact that unit cost are rising faster than those of any of our competitors , are other indicators ? Is not the underlying trend much higher than he has been prepared so far to admit ?
		4. I am sorry that that was not a more positive response , although I understand the reasons . Does the Minister accept that the Secretary of State for Culture , Media and Sport had appointed a lead person to give the funding ? That person claimed to be dealing with the Arts Council , and then—having held those involved spinning for a long time—finally said that there was no money . Was that because the Arts Council is more concerned about performing arts than other arts ? Does the Minister accept that Thanksgiving square—proposed by Jews , Muslims , Hindus , Christians and others—would be useful in finishing the waterfront ?
		5. Is not the hon Member for Isle of Wight ( Mr. Field ) unduly optimistic in assuming that Ministers will admit Northern Ireland representatives to any meaningful role in consultation or pay the slightest heed to what they say ? Does the Secretary of State accept that it is highly dangerous falsely to allege divisions within parties , although that is not unusual in this House and in other quarters ? Is it not even more dangerous to pursue the course of threatening to call the bluff of Northern Ireland elected representatives , a tactic that has failed so miserably and so disastrously in the past ?
		6. Does the Minister accept that the gap between what the Government say in the House about training and what is happening throughout the country is incredible ? In west Wales , for example , the number of training weeks has been cut by 43,000 , or 21 per cent . , including 38 places for special needs trainees . The number of courses for part - time training has been chopped all over Neath , depriving particularly women returnees of much - needed opportunities . Those women can not take up full - time courses because of child care responsibilities . Is not it time the Government admitted that their training programme is an absolute disgrace and a shambles ?
		7. Is not the real criticism that the balance is entirely wrong in the countryside , in that we are growing vast quantities of unwanted cereals while we are short of protein crops and farm woodlands ? Does the Minister accept that the Ministry 's reluctance to issue a White Paper that gives any signs for the future is an irresponsible attitude to adopt ?
		8. Does my hon Friend accept that there is a strong case in terms of welfare for giving every encouragement that we can to the export of lamb in carcase form rather than on the hoof ? Is not that case reinforced by the fact that when lambs go over to France and are slaughtered there , they are marketed as French , not British lamb ?
		9. Does my right hon Friend accept that what is required is speedy legislation in the new year in order to stop the sort of abuse by which Lord Ashcroft is trying to buy up marginal constituencies ? Is not that the sort of practice that should have stopped in the 19th century and can my right hon Friend promise us that we will not have to wait too long for such a change in the law ?
		10. Does the Minister accept that there is no civil defence whatsoever against a nuclear conflagration ? Is he aware that the Secretary of State for Defence has said that in the worst circumstances only a few minutes ' warning will be given ? Is not the best defence to opt out of the nuclear weapons race ?
		11. Does the Minister not agree that the position in the last seven years has been the worst in British history since records began ? Does his concern take him so far as to analyse the position in competing countries ? If so , does he not accept that Britain 's record is far worse than that of our competitors and that the competitors who have fared very well indeed have been those whose Governments have taken an entirely different approach from that adopted by the present United Kingdom Administration ? Does he not think that there are lessons to learn from our competitors ?
		12. Does the Minister accept that we are talking about terribly debilitating diseases that men and women have contracted in their places of work ? It appears that the Department of Health has not done enough to improve the detection of asbestosis and related diseases . Is not it time that consultation took place between the Secretary of State for Health and the Secretary of State for Employment to see what improvements can be made in the early detection and treatment of such diseases ?
		13. Is not the Minister yet again , by his answer to my hon Friend , attempting to mislead the House ? He has mentioned the youth training scheme . Is not the figure for youth unemployment only 1 per cent . different from what it was a year ago ? Does he accept that young people are no longer being attracted to the youth training scheme , either in Liverpool or nationally , and that there are 370,000 young unemployed who are not joining the youth training scheme ? There is something wrong with the scheme if the Government have to give such an answer to the House .
		14. Does the Minister accept that the need to watch progress has become somewhat more acute as a consequence of the Government 's failure to arrest the rising price of domestic fuels ? Is not the need for such a scheme an absolute necessity ?
		15. Does the Minister accept that many elderly people are looking for care in private homes because they can not get into local authority homes and that that arises from the numbers of geriatric patients in local authority homes ? Is not the answer for the Department to put more resources into psycho - geriatric care to relieve local authority homes and thereby enable people who want to go into them to find places ?
		16. Is not it a bit rich for Conservative Members to talk about debt in the current situation ? Does the Minister accept that the debt of local authorities , by law , is incurred in investment in long - term infrastructure projects ? Labour authorities that have debt have it because they have invested in housing , in schools and in public transport systems over the years . The difference between their debt and the Government 's debt is that the Government have frittered away the long - term assets of this country and have their debt because of their short - term economic crisis .
		17. Does the Minister accept that many schools still have not made the necessary adaptations , so that we are simply conning ourselves when we speak of parental choice ? Is not that choice severely limited not only because of a lack of access to the schools , but because of a lack of proper access to classrooms within the schools ?
		18. Does the Secretary of State accept that his Department 's estimates mean that growth in use of the private motor vehicle will need a road to accommodate demand equivalent to a 275-lane motorway from London to Glasgow ? Is not his proposal to increase the M25 to 14 lanes the down payment on that crazy policy ? Will he conduct a fundamental review of the road programme that will encourage people to transfer to public rather than private transport , as the only way of dealing with congestion and environmental problems ? I assure him that we will vigorously oppose his plans for the M25 through the summer and beyond .
		19. Is not the Minister really just trying to disguise a rowing back of what the Government have previously said ? It was apparent that the plan was for Eurostar services to run out of a newly redeveloped terminal at King 's Cross and St. Pancras . Does the Minister accept that , if such services are not introduced in due course , people in the north and the midlands will rightly blame the Government ?
		20. I thank the Secretary of State for that response . He knows that the National Institute of Adult Continuing Education published a survey that revealed that the number of adults participating in education is falling . My local college , Sutton College of Liberal Arts—SCOLA—has experienced a 10 per cent . drop in the past 12 months . Adult learners week , which starts on Saturday , will reveal the wide range of exciting and interesting courses that are available in the UK. Does the Secretary of State accept that Government policies for getting adults to participate in education are not working ? Is not it time for a rethink ?
		21. Does the Minister accept that one reason why there is such confusion among local authorities about whether the Transfer of Undertakings ( Protection of Employment ) Regulations should apply is that , although the Secretary of State announced in the most recent environment Question Time that the directive concerned did not apply to local authorities , the Minister has been telling local authority associations that they may wish to insert in their contracts a clause saying that it does apply to them ? Is not it time that not only local authorities but the public knew where they stood and that British workers enjoyed the same rights as workers in every other part of Europe ?
		22. Does my right hon Friend accept that inward investment in Wales would be killed if we introduced a national minimum wage or signed the social charter ? Is not it significant that those who seek to sell Wales short will destroy the Welsh economy by the restrictions that they suggest ?
		23. Does the Minister accept that it is unreasonable to fund that large expenditure , which must be met , from the charges made for water ? Does he accept that the profits retained to fund such improvements in capital works have driven up the price of Welsh water to the extent that some of my constituents , pensioners living in single - bedroomed flats , pay £ 220 a year in water charges ? Is not that ridiculous ? The Government must look at means of funding general improvement work other than through the taxation now charged by Welsh Water .
		24. Rather like in this Chamber , the prerequisites for good behaviour in the classroom include discipline and respect , both of which are more likely to flow from staffroom initiatives than from ministerial edicts . Will the Minister accept the invitation from Ashby school , a large and successful 14-to-19 comprehensive in North - West Leicestershire of which I am a governor , to look at our good behaviour incentives and totting - up system that imposes a varying number of points from the most minor misdemeanour to the most serious offences ? Twelve points will lead to exclusion . Is not this approach—a mixture of reward and sanctions—the most likely to achieve improvement both in the classroom and in this Chamber ?
		25. Does the Minister accept that the reduction of housing association grant to levels that even the Association of Mortgage Lenders describes as unrealistic means that many new housing association dwellings are now being let or put on offer at over £ 70 a week , which means that they are unaffordable for people who are not eligible for housing benefit ? Is not the shift of subsidy from bricks and mortar to means - tested benefit leading to more dependency ? Is that not proving more costly to the public purse in the long run ?
		26. Is not it unacceptable that the Secretary of State , who might have been expected to answer my question , has not formally met the STUC for over 15 months , even though it was anxious to meet him to discuss NEL , Scott Lithgow , Bishopton and other matters ? Is the attempt to marginalise active trade unionists in Scotland reflected in the White Paper proposals for local structures that will give far more weight to local employers than to local authorities and trade unionists , who are just as committed as anybody else to training and employment ? Does the Minister accept that , since the election , the Secretary of State has not attempted to achieve consensus in Scotland and that the only voices to which he is prepared to listen are those of the discredited , minority far right in his own party ?
		27. That is no good . Is not the answer to remove the financial straitjacket on local authorities ? Is it not damned nonsense to talk about cutting public expenditure when the Government are increasing it by £ 5,000 per man per year as the dole queues grow ? Does the Minister accept the figure of 428,380 unemployed in the building and related trades , such as brick , glass and timber , and that even that figure is increasing as the supply of council housing is cut ?
		28. I accept the constraints under which the employers must operate in this dispute , but is it not a fact that there is a great shortage of mathematics and science teachers ? Is not this shortage likely to continue until arrangements can be made to make salaries attractive to graduates in those disciplines ?
		29. I readily accept that the Labour Government had no depletion policy either , ever since they entered into the Varley assurances , but will the Minister agree that if the purpose of the Government is to use market conditions to create ideal circumstances for the exploitation of oil , we have the worst of all worlds , with the collapse of oil prices , partly due to over - production , and the very likely starvation of the oil platform yards ? Is not the whole matter completely and utterly out of balance ?
		30. Class sizes may be going down in Exeter but they are going up in south Devon . Is the Minister aware that 90,000 new homes are proposed for Devon but that schools in my constituency are already crammed to the gunnels and that children are already having to travel two hours each way by bus to get to school ? Is not the best way to make progress to rehabilitate schools such as the Stoke Fleming primary school ? School sites that already exist should be developed and more children should go to those schools , which are already good and performing well . Does the Minister accept that she will not succeed in reducing class numbers unless she either builds new schools or refurbishes old ones ?
		31. Does the Minister accept that if we are looking to win referendums , we need to hold them in areas where they are most likely to be won ? Why does he accept the boundaries put in place by the Conservatives , instead of setting up a review on which areas want to be in which regions ?
		32. Will my right hon Friend accept the congratulations of the House on the Government 's investment in British science week last week , which was so successful , and on retaining the size of the science budget ? Is not the commitment being shown by the Government the very commitment to British science that we require ?
		33. Will my right hon Friend accept the grateful thanks of my constituents and those of my hon Friend the Member for Bournemouth , West ( Mr. Butterfill ) for last week 's recommendation by the Local Government Commission that the borough of Bournemouth should return to unitary status after 20 years of county council control ? Is not that a clear demonstration of Conservative commitment to strong local government , in complete contrast to the unwanted policies of remote regional government favoured by Labour and the Liberal Democrats ?
		34. I thank my right hon and learned Friend for that answer . Will she accept my sincere tribute to her personally for her hard work and the committed attempts that she has made to raise working - life standards in the CPS ? I especially draw attention to her commitment to the training of non - legal staff so that they can obtain qualifications that enable them to aspire to go on to become prosecutors . Is not that the best way to improve working conditions in the CPS and to aid recruitment and retention ?
		35. Does the Minister accept that it is Government humbug to impose strict external financing limits on public bodies and then to argue that because they are so restricted those bodies must be privatised ? Is not the reality that the Post Office is and will continue to be an essential public service which requires a monopoly to enable it to deliver mail to every household in the land ? It needs relaxed external financing limits , to enable it to compete internationally , rather than more Government restrictions .
		36. Does my hon Friend accept that there is a practical difficulty in that very interesting suggestion ? As a result of a recent court decision , the admissibility of evidence stemming from a computer has been very much restricted . Is not that a reason for encouraging a debate on those issues ?
		37. Is not modernisation a polite way of talking about escalation ? Trident represents a marked escalation of the arms race . Does the Minister accept that the majority of people in Britain do not want Trident ? The Government have already cut their defence expenditure by £ 250 million and are likely to do so again in the autumn . We shall end up with a very expensive totem pole which we shall never be able to use , while at the same time our conventional forces are run down and are unable to defend the country properly .
		38. Is not one of the most offensive features of recent days the fact that the exercise of a legal right by the Palestinians at the United Nations has been met by illegal retaliation by the Israeli Government ? Does my right hon Friend accept that such illegal action serves only to undermine the authority of Mahmoud Abbas—and indeed of the Palestinian National Authority , which he leads—and in addition encourages those Palestinians , particularly in Gaza , who wrongly believe that violence is justified ?
		39. Within the boundaries of a monetarism which is characterised by soaring Government borrowing and a money supply figure which is out of relationship with what the Government want , does the Chancellor accept the need to restore output and demand in the economy ? Is not that the root of the problem which has put nearly 1 million people out of work in the last 18 months . ?
		40. Does the Minister accept that his Government ’s decision to cut nurse training places by 3,000 a year since 2010 has led to the huge shortage of nursing staff in the NHS and an increased reliance on nurses recruited from abroad and expensive agency staff , and that that will get worse with the abolition of bursaries ? Is not this a textbook example of a false economy from the Government ?
		41. Does my right hon Friend accept that the agreement in principle by Transport Ministers to liberalise European air transport will bring tremendous benefit to tourists and all consumers ? Is not that the sort of measure with which the Community should be involving itself , rather than trying to impose on its members such contentious proposals as the social charter ?
		42. Is the Minister aware that civil servants are worried because of the way in which Ministers , including the Prime Minister , have put the responsibility on civil servants for the leaking of the letter from the Solicitor - General to the then Secretary of State for Defence ? Is that not a most unfortunate practice ? Should not the Prime Minister accept the responsibility instead of putting it on to the private secretary in her office and on to the director of information in the Department of Trade and Industry ?
		43. Does not that sorry picture reveal the absolute need for us to tell our European partners that we will not allow any further contraction of our steel industry , not least because of their failure to fulfil their commitments to pursue the British course ? Does the Minister accept that if the proclaimed economic recovery proves to be significant our steel industry may already have been contracted excessively ?
		44. I accept that NATO is not expanding , but is my right hon Friend aware that , according to last night 's overseas broadcast by Russia , Greece has now abrogated nine of its 11 NATO treaties ? If a similar Socialist Government came to power in this country , is it not likely that a similar shrinkage would occur here ?
		45. Would the Minister not accept that this country 's elderly can also help to maintain demand in the economy ? Bearing in mind that many of them rely on their savings , on which they getting a negative return because of inflation and taxation , is it not time that the taxation system enabled the elderly , who rely upon savings , to get some meaningful return for their responsibility ?
		46. I accept that the options set out in the Serpell report are broad brushed , but has the Minister examined the interesting statement by the Secretary of State for Scotland , in an interview that was reported in the Sunday Standard of 9 January , that any Serpell option that involved substantial closures of railway lines in Scotland would be unacceptable to the Government ? Will the Minister confirm that that is the position ?
		47. Does the Minister not accept that given that sub - post offices are closing , fewer collections are taking place and morale in the postal services is at an all - time low , the only things that are increasing are the salary and bonus of the chief executive ? Bearing in mind that the Government are providing a subsidy to the Post Office , does the Minister not think that we should get rid of Mr. Crozier , who is doing such a bloody awful job ?
		48. Does the Minister accept that there is no evidence that increasing the classification to class B would reduce cannabis use , just as there was no evidence that reducing it to class C increased its use ? Is it not crazy for him and his colleagues to purport to have evidence - based policy making if they are willing to reject the advice of the ACMD when it reports ?
		49. Does the hon Gentleman accept that in Midlothian , and Newtongrange in particular , there is great concern about the allocation of financial resources for housing ? The Castle Rock housing association had to give £ 210,000 of ratepayers ' money to the Lothian estates when the lease expired on the land and buildings . Is that not an abuse of the law , and should not something be done about it ?
		50. Does the Minister accept that the problem with all waiting lists—including those for cataract operations—is that the Government 's waiting list initiative is distorting clinical priorities ? Dr. Peter Wilde , consultant cardiologist at the Bristol Royal infirmary , said this morning that heart patients are dying unnecessarily because they were waiting too long for surgery . Tragically , that is not due to a lack of resources . Ministers are forcing health authorities to perform minor procedures to shorten waiting lists faster—even if that means sicker patients , such as those of Dr. Wilde , having to wait longer . Is that not an unfair , unethical and immoral way to run a health service ? Patient care gets worse so that Minister 's press releases can get better .
		51. Does my right hon Friend accept that the imposition of a separate stabiliser for sheepmeat for United Kingdom farmers is deplorable ? Is it not a fact that it is most important at the price fixing next week to negotiate the maintenance of the variable premium and to resist the imposition of headage limits on upland farms and lowland areas ?
		52. Does the Under - Secretary understand the concern of many that there is already too much interference in what we eat and drink ? Fluoridation is one concern , but there is concern also about far too many colourings and additives and the effect that they have on children 's behaviour , about the reduction of basic vitamins and minerals in food , and about GM food . I accept that there is a positive dental benefit from fluoridation , but should not the Government concentrate on the real cause of the problems : the amount of sugar consumed by children ?
		53. Does the Minister accept that there is continuing concern in the city of Aberdeen about the unsatisfactory nature of the recent termination of the chief executive 's contract of employment , at a cost of nearly £ 300,000 to the local community ? Does he accept that it is not satisfactory that such a matter should be left entirely to a local council which many people feel has failed to discharge its duties , and that there is no means of securing an independent inquiry ? Does not he believe that the rules should be changed to allow for that ?
		54. Notwithstanding his answer to the hon Member for Linlithgow ( Mr. Dalyell ) , does the Minister accept that a massive amount of incapacity benefit is not taken up ? Would he accept that there is therefore no reason to go ahead with the planned , but much opposed , cuts in the benefit ?
		55. Snibston discovery park is a regional museum based on the former colliery of that name , sunk by the great George Stephenson . Would the Minister accept an invitation to come and look at the work that is done there ? Creativity , energy and professionalism has enabled the museum to reinvent itself in the most impressive fashion . It is a successful museum for an area much wider than north - west Leicestershire . We could do worse than to have that as a beacon for the way ahead .
		56. Would my right hon Friend accept that the fact that the euro has strengthened as a currency indicates that the markets believe that the weaker countries will not be able to push water up hill for much longer and are bound to drop out of the euro before very long ?
		57. Would the Minister for Sport accept an invitation from me to visit Kettering Town football club for its FA cup second round clash with Leeds United , when he might be able to discuss with the club and its fans potential Government support , through planning guidelines or finance , for the redevelopment of the stadium ?
		58. Does the Minister accept that one reason for the increase in rates , apart from the reduction in rate support grant , is the fact that back in the early 1970s a Tory Government promised to get rid of rates altogether and then decided to reorganise local government , which cost a fortune ? Does he further accept that before the general election they promised to introduce a poll tax and to get rid of rates once again ? They have promised to reorganise local government , and that will cost a fortune . Can we really believe anything the Tories say ?
		59. Will the Paymaster General accept that the programme is not leading to people getting real jobs and that the main purpose of the exercise is to reduce the unemployment figures by false means , which is resulting in many people losing the benefit to which they are legitimately entitled ? Is that not a disgrace ?
		60. Will the Minister accept that my constituency will find that figure shocking , outrageous and wholly abhorrent because it has a large number of people unemployed , including skilled building workers , when we desperately need a new hospital in Washington , new council houses in the borough of Sunderland and new factories in Hetton and Houghton ? Is this not just another example of the fact that the Government simply do not care ?
		61. Will the right hon Gentleman accept that the unemployment figures that he has produced are falsified because 1 million are not registered as unemployed who in fact are unemployed , 750,000 are on temporary employment and many women are not registered as unemployed ? Is it not a fact that if the Government run to the end of their period in office , about 4·5 million will be unemployed if the present trend continues ?
		62. Given that today 's European Scrutiny Committee report describes the new treaty as " substantially equivalent " to the EU constitution , does the Foreign Secretary not accept that the British people should have a right to vote on that in a referendum ? Does he not remember that that was his pledge at the last election ?
		63. Does the Minister accept that the vast majority of human beings accepts the answer that he has given ? Will not he accept that the question raised by the right hon Member for Down , South ( Mr. Powell ) bears a macabre affinity to the sort of things that the right hon Gentleman believes about those black people who come into Britain ? Will not the hon Gentleman accept that such sentiments , if continued , will lead to a great deal of killing ?
		64. Is the Minister aware that many cities with housing stress , such as Salford , used the whole of their allocations last year ? Does the Minister accept my hon Friend 's proposal that authorities which make a further cut beyond that which the Government require should provide some of the extra money for housing stress areas ? Is not that a sensible suggestion ?
		65. Does my hon Friend accept that the adoption of open - access IT systems can result in significant savings ? Is his Department promoting their use throughout the education sector ?
		66. The Minister may be aware that at the Kobi Nazrul school in a deprived part of Tower Hamlets , 92 per cent of 11-year - olds achieve level 4 in reading , while a school in a leafy middle - class suburb can achieve only 71 or 72 per cent . Is it the case that one of those schools places much greater emphasis than the other on synthetic phonics in the teaching of reading ? Does the Minister accept that if he wants the delivery unit to report progress on his stalled target for reading , he must insist that greater emphasis is placed on synthetic phonics in primary schools ?
		67. Does my right hon Friend accept that we must keep the present low and stable rate of inflation if industry is to have the confidence to invest and provide jobs ? Is it not disturbing , therefore , that material costs to industry have increased by over 8 per cent . in the last year , and is that not a timely reminder that we simply can not relax our efforts in the fight against rising prices ?
		68. Does the Secretary of State accept that engineering , science and technical subjects are not seen as being as sexy as some arts subjects , which seem to attract all the funding ? We are looking for value - added employment , which means that we need technicians , scientists and engineers . Is it not therefore about time to incentivise our youngsters into universities to study those subjects ? If we do not do so , there will be a skills shortage at the top end , and this country will come a cropper .
		69. Does the Minister accept that the abolition of severe disablement allowance will hit especially hard those who in early adulthood have caring responsibilities for children , for people who are disabled , or for elderly parents ? Such people often are unable to make national insurance contributions , and so are not eligible for incapacity benefit . If their marriage partners have incomes of their own , they probably will not be eligible for any means - tested benefits either . Is it not rather unfair that people who , through no fault of their own , become incapacitated after several years of looking after other people will get no recompense for their loss of earning capacity ?
		70. Does the hon Gentleman accept that the concept of first use is made necessary by the conventional imbalance ? Is he suggesting , therefore , that the NATO countries should spend the same proportion of their economy on defence as the Warsaw pact countries spend ?
		71. Does the Secretary of State accept that mental health issues sometimes come to light only as a result of self - referral and that the culture of all three services is against such self - referral ? Is one way of dealing with that to ensure that , during training , people - and not just those who will be in the chain of command - accept and understand the possibility of mental health issues arising , and that they are willing to recognise that and , if necessary , to take steps to deal with it ?
		72. Does my right hon Friend accept that that news should be welcomed on both sides of the House ? Is it not the case that on the trip he was identifying markets , boosting British business , ensuring that British companies can take advantage of that business and , in the end , creating jobs back here at home ?
		73. Does the Minister accept that even those of us who are sceptical about the more exaggerated theories of global warming want to see rapid moves towards greater diversity of supply , less reliance on imported hydrocarbons and therefore the rapid development of nuclear energy ? Is it not a disgrace that it has taken so long to get to any kind of resolution to this problem of the disposal of nuclear waste ?
		74. Is my hon Friend aware that as long ago as 1972 I had my first Adjournment debate on this subject , when my right hon and learned Friend the Member for Warrington , South ( Mr. Carlisle ) accepted that there was a direct link between the increasing number of self - service stores and the increase in shoplifting ? Does the Home Office accept that where trading methods cause crime , that cause and effect should not be ignored by society ?
		75. Does my hon Friend accept that the question of gold reserves has been brought into stark focus by the enormous increase in the number of financial instruments and the financial pyramiding involved , and by the vast increase in trading volume throughout the world ? The question arises as to the implications for the financial community of any failure of settlement . Is it not prudent for the Government to increase their gold reserves at such a time ?
		76. Does the right hon Gentleman accept that given the social importance of rural post offices , especially to the elderly , the infirm , the handicapped and those without their own transport , the House should get together to determine a way in which the political parties , which are all interested in the matter , and the Post Office can agree a policy that would meet the concerns of most hon Members , especially those who represent rural areas ? Is this not an issue that might generate cross - party consultation and discussion ?
		77. Does my right hon Friend accept that if the outcome of the referendum is to engage the confidence of the Scottish people , the campaign must be conducted with candour and transparency ? This week the Government published their view of the legal consequences of independence . Is it not time for those who argue for independence to do the same ?
		78. Given that the range of estimates for the social and environmental cost of carbon is anything from a minimum in the Stern review of €25 up to €70 or so , and even though we have seen a welcome tightening of the price , as the Secretary of State says , at €18 in the second phase , the reality is that as we came into the Chamber this morning the current price for the current phase was 31 cents per tonne , which sends out a pretty appalling signal . Does the Secretary of State accept that the Council needs to try to tighten the price in the current phase as well as deal with the next phase ? Is , indeed , the tightness of the next phase adequate , and what measures is he urging on his colleagues in the Council to improve the scheme ?
		79. The Minister will be aware that the Met Office is based in my constituency , not in Reading , East . Does he accept that the people of Bracknell greatly appreciate having the Met Office in Bracknell , and that the town has had a long association with it ? The people of Bracknell are appalled to learn from the hon Member for Reading , East ( Jane Griffiths)—this morning , on local radio and now in the House—that they should all lose their jobs and that the office should relocate to Liverpool . Is that official Labour party policy ?
		80. Does the Home Secretary accept that under the current arrangements we already lack adequate directly elected , local accountability and that the move towards larger forces will merely make this matter worse ? For example , in Hertfordshire we currently have a police authority of 16 members , none of whom is directly elected , but nine of whom are at least county councillors . If we move towards an eastern region force , which is one of the options that the Government are considering , we will have a police authority of up to 23 members , of which at most two will be Hertfordshire county councillors . Is the Home Secretary merely making a bad position worse ?
		81. Does my right hon and learned Friend accept that many of us supported the hon Member for Sunderland , South ( Mr. Mullin ) in the appeal procedure ? It was the longest appeal in the history of this country . Is anything to be gained by trying to disparage and discredit British justice ? No one had a fairer trial . No one had a fairer appeal . Is it not time that the Opposition looked at the IRA , instead of being its greatest supporters .
		82. Does the Minister accept that not a single one of the many thousands of representations from constituents that I have received in the past two years asked for more expensive government at a south - east level ? Is he not merely trying to carry out the will of Brussels against that of the British people ?
		83. Does the Minister accept that when North Sea oil is no longer available the British ecomomy will depend on the output of British industry ? Is the hon Gentleman as frightened as I am about the appalling figures of output , which is at its lowest level for about 13 or 14 years ?
		84. Does my right hon Friend accept that many of my constituents travel to Cumbria , and Carlisle in particular , to avail themselves of both basic and specialist NHS treatment ? Is it not the duty of every hon Member to participate in debates and vote on a truly national health service for the entire UK ?
		85. Does the Minister accept that the children who will gain most from education at a specialist school are those with ability and interest in that specialist subject ? However , specialist schools are able to select only a small proportion of pupils on the basis of aptitude for the specialist subject , as defined by the Government . The maximum benefit is therefore being gained by the few , rather than by the many . The Government have already lost a court case brought by Wandsworth council on the adjudicator 's decision to reduce partial selection in some of its schools . Moreover , the Government are in court today for a case involving the ruling of an adjudicator on selection for a specialist school . Will the Government accept , therefore , that their whole adjudication process is fundamentally flawed ? Does it not reflect the Government 's prejudice against providing the education that is right for every child ? Does it not show that the whole adjudication system should be scrapped immediately ?
		86. Bearing in mind the social distress experienced throughout Wales at present—so much directly due to the policies of the Government—does the Secretary of State not realise that this is hardly the time to put our local authorities in a straitjacket ? Why does he not accept that they have many additional problems and commitments , which they are trying to handle in a most responsible fashion ?
		87. Why does the Minister not accept that he can not have it both ways ? He can not spend his time in this country defending a common fisheries policy that the industry wants to get rid of , and his time in Europe failing to get the British industry a better deal under that common fisheries policy . He has to do one thing or the other—either pull us out or get a better deal for the nation , which contributes 75 per cent . of the fish .
		88. Are these not depressing figures in the light of question 1 and the current unemployment , especially when we consider the state of the building industry , which is really on its knees ? I accept that not all new jobs can come from public expenditure , but do the Government not realise that the building industry is screaming out for some form of public expenditure ? Does the Minister appreciate that that would be a way of starting to provide the people of Scotland with decent houses and of getting the industry into good shape ?
		89. Does the Minister realise that the people along the border in my constituency are living in absolute fear for their lives ? Many of the attacks on the Castlederg area have been made by people who have left the Irish Republic , in which they have found a safe haven , have done their dastardly deed and have gone right back into the Irish Republic . Does he realise that nothing has hindered them in any way , certainly no action by the southern authorities ? Concerning the leaks that have already cost the life of one of my constituents in Castlederg , is the Minister aware that we are alarmed at the improved relationships between the Garda and the IRA ? Does he accept the inquiry which , it has been suggested , is sufficient ? I assure him that the people in my constituency , who are living in fear for their lives , will not accept the inquiry that has been set up in the Irish Republic and that nothing but a full independent inquiry will be accepted .
		90. As the Minister is interested in the Labour Party and its position on a united Ireland , will he accept that many of us believe not only in a united Ireland but in a united Socialist Ireland—an Ireland that will challenge the green Tories in the South and the orange Tories in the North ? Will he further accept that this is not a new concept , but was argued by Jim Larkin and James Connolly many years ago ? It is still valid today . Is he aware that Irish workers will still back the concept , given the lead that I hope the Labour Party will give , as my hon Friend the Member for Sheffield , Hillsborough ( Mr. Flannery ) said ?
		91. Next Friday , I shall visit my local hospital to thank some 800 volunteers who give their services free to the people of Harrogate . They , like the army of people around the country who volunteer their services , see their costs increasing , but next year the whole charitable sector will have its income drastically reduced . This week 's statement contained almost no additional support for charities . How can the Prime Minister accept giving irresponsible bankers billions of pounds while the charities are on the streets with begging bowls ?
		92. Does the Minister accept that , due to the increase in the number of cases in the High Court of Justiciary , Scottish judges are less able to spend time dealing with civil business ? Is this not the time for a radical review of the Court of Session procedures , to ensure that civil business is more speedily conducted ? In the end , delay is against the interests of justice .
		93. Does the Minister accept that the privatised utilities are obsessed with getting rid of jobs and employees in order to make a profit ? Last year , when BT 's system was affected by thunderstorms , the company did not have enough workers to get the system working again and had to bring in engineers from the Republic of Ireland . Is that not nonsensical ?
		94. The Minister may have seen early - day motion 280 , which I tabled more than two months ago and which gained all - party support from Members . Does she accept the view of the Consumers Association published in today 's Which ? , which suggests that she and her colleagues throughout Europe may be simply too late to be able to guarantee segregation of genetically modified ingredients in our foodstuffs ? Is it not a classic case of the horse charging around the countryside , having long since bolted , while we are trying only now to shut the stable door ?
		95. Does the hon Gentleman accept that disablement benefits have become the instrument whereby the disabled are put at a serious disadvantage compared with the able - bodied ? Is that not a disgrace and is it not vital to take immediate steps to overcome the difficulties and to place the disabled at least on an equal basis with the able - bodied ?
		96. Does the Minister accept that productivity is calculated in many ways , including loss of manpower , and that the loss of 70,000 men has contributed to increased production ? Is it not a fact that if he does not keep track of imports of coal and plans carefully , increasing productivity , the possibility of increased shift time and increased investment could lead to colliery closures ?
		97. Does my right hon Friend accept that , although parents in Lancashire are extremely pleased to know that that additional money is being provided , they are becoming increasingly frustrated by the fact that the local education authority , under Labour control , continues to waste money , as it did last year , when it made cuts in schools at the same time as providing advisers to advise teenage girls on lesbianism ? Is that not the record of Labour in office , and is it not a disgrace ?
		98. Does the Financial Secretary accept that the business expansion scheme , especially now , when it is so overwhelmingly employed for the purposes of private rented property , has long ceased to be a genuine source of new equity for enterprise , and has become simply a principal means of tax avoidance for higher rate taxpayers ? Is that not another example of what we have seen so often under this Government ? For the great majority of taxpayers it is pay - as - you - earn , but for the privileged few it is pay - if - you - like .
		99. Is the Prime Minister aware that last May , patients from my constituency attending the Queen Elizabeth II hospital in Welwyn Garden City were waiting a maximum of 12 months for elective surgery ? Today , nine months later , they are having to wait 18 months . Does the Prime Minister accept that my constituents feel that they were conned by the Labour party at the general election , as it said that waiting times and waiting lists would fall ? Is this not an example of the Labour party saying one thing at a general election and doing another in office ?
		100. Is the Secretary of State fully aware of the magnitude of that increase ? Is he aware that 1,300 redundancies have been registered with the local employment office in Caernarvon in recent weeks and that that adds to the escalating unemployment rate ? Does he accept that the CEGB has been run down in Dinorwig , that the Bernard Wardle factory has been closed and that several public works have come to an end ? Is it not therefere ridiculous to downgrade the Arfon area from a special development area to an ordinary one , when the unemployment rate will probably exceed 20 per cent ?

	100 sample questions that were assigned type 7 (34449 total questions with this type) :
		1. Does my right hon and learned Friend agree that the sheer scale of the support shown by the Russian people for Boris Yeltsin and the programme of reforms gives a tremendous boost to international confidence in the long - term future of Russia ? Does he also agree that in the near term substantial aid will be necessary to help the difficult process of economic transformation ? Will he therefore comment on the quantity and quality of Britain 's aid to Russia ?
		2. Does the Secretary of state agree that when lives , no matter whose lives they are , are lost in Northern Ireland it is particularly distasteful that there are always those who will gloat over the loss of life and see death as some sort of victory ? Does he agree also that it is particularly distasteful when politicians do so , because that only feeds the bitternesses and the hatreds that ensure that death will occur in the future ? Does the Secretary of State further agree that the most powerful statement in the past 12 months was made at the weekend by Mrs. McCartan , the mother of an innocent 17-year - old who was the victim of a sectarian murder , when she shouted . " Stop , " and appealed to all sides to stop the killing ?
		3. Does my right hon Friend agree that if we are to be successful in including young people , local partnerships and local authorities must be involved in all policies ? Does he agree also that successfully helping young people will be the test of our policy of including the excluded ? Are local authorities to be given further advice on funding sixth form education ?
		4. Does my hon Friend agree that he might he being unfair to the right hon Member for Birmingham , Sparkbrook ( Mr. Hattersley ) , who predicted a stirling crisis , because the excellent policies that we are now following means that the pound is bound to be strong ? Does he also agree that in this excellent Budget the Chancellor of the Exchequer did not want interest rates and the pound to go too high ? Would not our best hope be for the Bank of England to follow the Chancellor 's excellent lead ?
		5. I thank my hon Friend for that answer . Does he agree that women have always proved themselves—especially in Bosnia , as I have witnessed—able to take part in the armed forces ? Does he agree also that women are capable of taking part in combat roles in the Royal Navy ? Does not that put paid to the claim that women are not suitable and that such roles are suitable only for the chaps ? Thank you .
		6. Does my right hon and learned Friend agree that even more facilities for employment training would be required if we were to adopt the Labour party 's policies and introduce statutory minimum wages and impose restrictions on part - time workers ?
		7. Not just church congregations but individual members can use credit unions . Now that the law has been changed , organisations can set up community accounts . Does the right hon Gentleman agree that churches ought to look at investing their own funds in credit unions ?
		8. Does my right hon Friend agree that people and political parties who go around stirring up issues relating to the plight of asylum seekers in Britain breed only intolerance and disharmony in our society , and that we , along with everyone in this nation , should seek a society that is more tolerant to the plight of those individuals ?
		9. The Secretary of State recently stated her ambition for the Government potentially to ban civil society organisations from raising concerns about the admissions processes of schools . Those organisations perform an important public duty . Constituents have been in touch with me to say that they find the admissions process too complex and too lengthy to deal with by themselves . Does the Minister agree that banning civil society organisations from raising concerns will not only exacerbate the difficulties that parents already face , but further enable breaches of the admissions code ?
		10. Does my right hon Friend agree that while community service can play an important part in arrangements made for the 16 to 18-year - olds it is still important that the overall emphasis should be laid on training towards an industrial society ?
		11. Intergen is keen and ready to build a new super - efficient gas - fired power station in my constituency with Siemens as the contractor . The pension fund and Chinese owners , however , will not commit to the £ 500 million investment required until Intergen has won a contract to supply at the capacity auction in December . Does the Minister agree that that is causing an unnecessary delay and will he agree to meet me and Intergen to see what we can do to bring forward this important investment ?
		12. I thank my hon Friend for that answer . I am sure that he recognises that the test was introduced by one of the most vicious and vindictive Acts of the last Parliament . It had little to do with benefit tourism and more to do with people from the Indian subcontinent . Does he agree that , as a minimum , the Act should be amended so that the test does not apply to British citizens and people with the right of permanent abode in Great Britain ?
		13. Does the right hon Lady agree that , subject only to the very limited doctrinal exemption that the Government already propose , the sexual orientation regulations must apply in full to all organisations , religious or otherwise , including adoption agencies , charities , general practitioners , housing trusts , nurseries and youth groups , because the principle of equality before the law must take precedence over the views of a vociferous religious minority which , however sincere , is fundamentally opposed to that important principle ?
		14. Does the Minister agree that originally both the Turkish Cypriots and the Greek Cypriots accepted in principle the confidence - building measures proposed by the United Nations , and that the collapse of the talks last week was a result of a new map being submitted by the United Nations at the request of the Greek Cypriots which contradicted the original one presented on the table ?
		15. I think the way in which the hon Member for Ashford was treated by the police was disgraceful and if it turns out that my right hon Friend had in fact been informed of the police action before it took place—something that she has denied—she would have to resign . Correspondingly , the hon and learned Member for Beaconsfield ( Mr. Grieve ) has said to my right hon Friend , in terms , that she lied when saying that she had not been informed in advance . Does she agree that , if it is proved that she had not been told in advance , the hon and learned Gentleman should resign ?
		16. Does my hon Friend agree that , given the estimate that some 1 million under - fives are underfed , it is obscene that Saddam Hussein should have squandered some $ 1,000 million on building luxury palaces for himself , and it is dishonest that he should have sought to put the blame on United Nations sanctions ?
		17. I thank my right hon Friend for her comments . In one of my Church of England schools , 90 per cent . of the pupils are Muslim . That demonstrates that faith schools can work . Does my right hon Friend agree that in some areas where we extend the number of religious schools , it could lead to further self - segregation , which would fly in the face of what some of us are trying to achieve—greater integration ?
		18. Does the Minister agree that reserved parliamentary seats for the military are not compatible with a modern democracy ? It is now clear that the military in Burma retains too much power and influence and that it is time for the international community to reassess Burma ’s commitment to democracy and human rights .
		19. After Romford hospital , next on the waiting list for private finance initiative surgery should be Portsmouth ’s Queen Alexandra hospital . Does my right hon Friend agree that massive annual repayments and restrictive procurement practices are preventing best care from being delivered , and that the contract should go under the knife and the savings given to Portsmouth ’s health economy , not Treasury coffers ?
		20. No doubt my hon Friend will have noted that since January 1987 unemployment in Scotland has fallen by 80,000 . Does he agree that local authorities in Scotland and the Scottish TUC , in turning their backs on the unemployed and not participating in the employment training programme , are ensuring that many of them will not have the opportunity to fill the 20,000 vacancies that currently exist in Scotland ?
		21. Does the Minister agree that the work done by his Department is being undermined by the Department of Education and Science , especially by cutting the facilities available for training teachers in computing ? Most institutes of education no longer have lecturers in computer studies . In addition , the DES is either unable or refuses to provide sufficient software for the scheme . As a result , the scheme is in jeopardy because , although the Minister is providing the hardware , the teaching facilities are not available .
		22. A couple of weeks ago I met George Gallop of A4e , who runs the Work programme in Southampton . He introduced me to two young people whose lives had been utterly transformed by the programme . It was truly inspirational . Does the Minister agree that we should be celebrating such successes , and spreading the techniques employed by Mr Gallop more widely around the country ?
		23. Does my hon Friend agree that all the advantages that we have with regard to increased competitiveness , lower interest rates , and lower inflation , and the advantages in price and the other things that go with it , could be set at naught if we do not achieve the highest quality possible in our goods and services , so that we can beat off the foreign imports on our own terms and show , as we used to in the past , that " Great Britain " means " great " in manufacture and services ?
		24. The Deputy Leader of the House is being unusually intransparent—if that is a word ; I like to make things up—untransparent . [ Hon Members : " Opaque . " ] Indeed . Anyway , the point that I am making is that it is beyond belief that an average could not be worked out by taking a sample of questions . My view is that the Government are hiding something . Does he agree ?
		25. Does my right hon and learned Friend agree that setting up the student loans company in Glasgow will bring new job opportunities ?
		26. I had the opportunity this morning of speaking on the electronic telephonic device to Sir Anthony Beaumont - Dark , who had one or two ideas . He seemed to think that it was not a bad idea to reduce interest rates in a gentle sort of fashion , taking into account what the deutschmark is doing , and that we should keep up a reasonable semblance of public expenditure in capital terms . I thought to myself at the time , " That is not a bad idea " . Does the Prime Minister agree ?
		27. Like many other Members of this House , I am extremely concerned at the spread of AIDS in Africa and its devastating effect on the population . Does my right hon Friend agree that the situation in respect of drugs is getting worse ? Despite the fact that drugs are being made available much more cheaply , they are finding their way into markets other than those for which they were intended . That said , I thank her for the excellent work that she is doing in this area .
		28. Today is the longest day , and no one needs to be a visitor to Stonehenge or , indeed , a great reader of the Bournemouth Echo to realise that this is a very popular move that has cross - party support . Does my hon Friend agree that the tourism industry at least would like such a change ? Indeed , it has been calling for it for a number of years .
		29. I thank the Secretary of State for his answer . Last week , however , the European Parliament voted to hold back carbon credits from the EU emissions trading scheme . Does the Secretary of State agree that the 20 Conservative MEPs who voted against the proposals were voting not only against action to tackle carbon emissions and prevent climate change , but against the interests of British business ?
		30. Does my hon Friend agree that morale was truly lifted with the change of Government ? I believe that that has been the main boost to the armed forces .
		31. Any reputable organisation evaluating its success employs external consultants or impartial people , or at least consults its consumers . When I go round schools in this country , as I do very regularly , I find a devastated landscape . Does the Secretary of State agree ? I find unaccountable schools , a top - down culture , a restricted curriculum , and a very low regard for this Secretary of State .
		32. I thank my hon Friend for his answer , which seems to indicate progress with honouring a commitment given to the Treasury Committee last June . As my hon Friend will be aware , both the Treasury Committee and the Public Accounts Committee have expressed doubts about the reliability of the construction of the public sector comparator , as those responsible do not see public finance as a serious alternative . Does he agree that the best way of dealing with that problem is for the Government to announce that public finance will be available for worthwhile capital projects , such as the new hospital in south Birmingham , if it can be shown that that is a better way than private finance of giving value for money to the taxpayer ?
		33. Free schools and academies reduce bureaucracy so that more time can be spent on education . Does the Minister agree that all those schools should be encouraged in all areas so that children from any background can have access to an environment that encourages aspiration and ambition ?
		34. My hon Friend referred to the importance of stability in Kosovo . Does he agree that any move by the new United States Administration to take precipitate action to withdraw their forces from Kosovo and Bosnia could only be destabilising , and could lead to an upsurge of violence and renewed conflict throughout the region ?
		35. Does the right hon Gentleman agree that not only is electrification important for modernisation and saving fuel but that it would generate important orders throughout a large number of industries , and consequently increase employment generally ?
		36. Estimates suggest that the Government actually lose between £ 280 million to £ 300 million a year to fuel smuggling and laundering in Northern Ireland . That pushes up fuel taxes for everyone , which is deeply unfair . Does my right hon Friend agree that extending rural fuel pilots to the new economic zones would cut smuggling and save the taxpayer an absolute fortune ?
		37. Not just voluntary services have a role to play , but private businesses such as Marks & Spencer , and indeed other well known department stores . Does my right hon Friend agree that we should encourage private enterprise to help in the rehabilitation of offenders to get them back to work ?
		38. Does the Minister agree that improving the life chances of all looked - after children should be an absolute priority for the Government , and will she consider supporting the amendments tabled to the Savings Accounts and Health in Pregnancy Grant Bill that address the issue of child trust funds for looked - after children ?
		39. On Friday my grandson Charlie enjoyed the delights of Bolton 's excellent free aquarium and museum . Does my hon Friend agree that the pleasure of museums should not be confined just to rich children , any more than membership of this House should be confined to rich adults ?
		40. Does the Secretary of State agree that the introduction of the minimum wage and the increase in national insurance contributions , together with the burden of the devolved Parliament in Scotland , have damaged the competitiveness of Scottish industry , as compared both with English and with other European industries ?
		41. We heard this morning about a focus on the positive opportunities for free trade with the Commonwealth and Australia . Does the Minister agree that that gives a great opportunity to reassure businesses in our constituencies that this Government can make a great success of the bold choice made by our voters ?
		42. Does the Home Secretary agree that if he wants to move from rhetoric to effective action he should not be closing bail hostels in the west midlands that are badly needed as part of the strategy for dealing with offenders in what the courts believe to be the most appropriate manner ?
		43. Does my hon Friend agree that as the student loans scheme has enabled more students to enter higher education this year , and as students do not have to repay the loan until the year after they have graduated and at a zero real rate of interest , that is a very good deal for students and can in no way be construed as depriving them of the opportunity to enter higher education ?
		44. Does the Secretary of State agree that , if the United Kingdom stayed in the European Union and completed the single European market , our growth could increase by 7 % within a decade , but that , if we left the EU and had a relationship with it such as that of Norway or Switzerland , our exports could be as much as 14 times lower over the same period ?
		45. The Arab peace initiative could prove vital in assisting a move towards the essential two - state solution for Israel and the long - suffering Palestinian people . Does the Minister agree that in the light of yesterday ’s welcome Tunisian election results , which were good news not only for the Tunisian people but for the wider Arab world , it is right for such regional initiatives to be considered as a matter of urgency ?
		46. I thank my hon Friend for his reply . I am sure that my right hon and hon Friends on the Government Front Bench were as shocked as the rest of the House to learn that , in the conflict , Afghanistan did not have one functioning hospital . Does my hon Friend agree that the international community should now commit itself early on , through the UN , to specific projects , including hospitals , to help rebuild Afghanistan , retain hearts and minds and shame all the warlords who reduced their own country to rubble ?
		47. Does my hon Friend agree that the taxes levied by the EEC destroy jobs ?
		48. Does the Secretary of State agree that all the major parties in the coming election should commit to a real - terms increase in the defence budget and to the 2 % NATO target , because only that way can we hope to keep our nation safe in an increasingly hostile and menacing world ?
		49. I agree that those are encouraging figures , but does my hon Friend agree that it might be better for speech therapists if they left the Whitley council and , taking advantage of the new arrangements for community care and the Health Service , seriously considered setting themselves up as independent , non - profit making trusts to tender their services to all the contractors who might wish to buy them ?
		50. Does my right hon Friend agree that his proposals will allow more decision - takers to be involved in the industry ? The Opposition should recognise that that is healthier for both the suppliers of generation equipment and the consumers of electricity .
		51. Does the Home Secretary agree that the Joint Committee , on which I sat , confirmed the desperate need for new laws in this area—for one , to catch paedophiles and other types of criminals and terrorists—and so agreed with the Government ’s policy of introducing such new laws ?
		52. Does the Prime Minister agree that if we are to tear down the apartheid in the education system , for which he argued a few weeks ago , not only should well - performing private schools support under - performing state schools on an ad hoc basis , but we should go further and encourage them to federate ?
		53. Returning to the question of Hamas , does the Foreign Secretary agree that the reported comments of Ismail Haniya yesterday were appalling and are already being seized on by enemies of peace on both sides of the Israeli - Palestinian divide ? Does he agree that we must not be deflected from the cause of peace but must recognise the potential for unity between Fatah and Hamas and recognise that peace is ultimately built between enemies , not with friends ?
		54. Despite assurances from the Government that there would be no more austerity - driven benefit cuts , any family whose third or subsequent child is born after April 2017 will not qualify for child tax credit , which could mean a loss of more than £ 2,000 per child . Does the Secretary of State agree that to protect just - managing families , this repugnant measure must be abandoned on Wednesday ?
		55. Many practitioners say that the proposals to reintroduce the means test for criminal legal aid under the Criminal Defence Service Bill will do little to resolve the legal aid crisis gripping this country . Does the Minister agree ?
		56. Does my right hon Friend agree that the price freeze that Labour proposes , but that many energy players and experts oppose , will not only reduce competition in the energy market but reduce investment in our energy infrastructure , which is sorely needed after too many years of neglect ?
		57. The Prime Minister will be aware of Citigroup ’s report , issued yesterday , on green energy investment in Scotland . Does he agree that this report very ably demonstrates that the benefits of green energy in the UK are unlocked only by combining Scotland ’s renewable potential with the large - scale investment made possible by the UK ; and does he agree that a drawn - out independence referendum is a serious distraction from that ?
		58. Does my hon Friend agree that universal provision of nursery education can not be justified on grounds of cost , and that the present variety of provision for pre - school children is largely beneficial to the needs of children today ?
		59. Does my right hon and learned Friend agree that it hardly behoves the Opposition to criticise Conservative MEPs and Members of Parliament for speaking with a united voice , when one can hardly describe the Labour Party as having a united voice on Europe ?
		60. Does my right hon Friend agree that to use taxpayers ' money to support jobs in one sector of the economy merely takes money away from the profitable and productive side of the economy ?
		61. Does the Secretary of State agree that the measures in the White Paper that move consultants and services from secondary care to primary care tend to threaten A and E departments , and what will she do to minimise that threat ?
		62. Does my right hon Friend agree that whatever the outcome of the referendum in June , the threats we face mean that our bilateral intelligence - sharing relationships with other European countries will remain vital , and that , working with those outside the EU , European relationships will continue unimpaired to ensure we remain as safe as we can be from external threats ?
		63. Does my hon Friend agree that although the Government have done a great deal to stimulate energy - from - waste projects , it often becomes a matter of planning permission ? Whether it is an incinerator or pyrolisis , or a different method of mechanical or biological treatments , so often a nimbyish attitude towards such a project prevents us from moving in a positive direction and the contribution that such technology could make is stilted .
		64. This Government are to increase the compulsory age of education to 18 , thereby removing the need to incentivise 16 to 18-year - olds to stay in education . Does my right hon Friend agree that that will increase social mobility if we offer vocational and academic studies ?
		65. Despite our Government 's stated intent not to sell arms in conflict zones , to regimes that abuse human rights , or to the poorest countries on the planet , the Defence Export Services Organisation is still dealing with Sri Lanka and Uganda in the first category , Israel and Indonesia in the second , and Nigeria and Pakistan in the third . Does the Minister agree that we should launch a coup against DESO and install the Export Control Organisation in the Ministry of Defence so that we can start to build , at last , an ethical defence and foreign policy ?
		66. Does my right hon Friend agree that the Scottish Constitutional Convention spent months talking , yet failed to address the Goschen Barnett formula , the West Lothian question and the number of Scottish Members of this Parliament ? Because of that , any proposals from that source would have no hope whatever of getting through Parliament to be implemented and , therefore , they are fraudulent and flawed .
		67. Having been members of the single market for more than four decades , many businesses have deeply embedded supply chains and customer relationships throughout the European Union . Does the Prime Minister agree that any future deal with the EU must include access to the single market ?
		68. Does my hon Friend agree that people do not want to pay higher taxes ? Indeed , they want to pay less tax . If people wanted to pay more taxation , the Labour party would not be so desperate to hide the truth about its extravagant spending policies .
		69. Many organisations now require flexible working , but child care provision generally does not reflect that . Does the Minister agree that employers are best placed to make such provision ? Is she happy with the fact that only 5 per cent . of employers provide creches , and if not , what will she do to remedy the situation ?
		70. Does my hon Friend agree that more appeals on disability benefits should be held locally and that , if they were , that would improve clearance times out of all recognition ?
		71. Does my right hon Friend agree that , when comparing state pensions we need to look at the other benefits that pensioners receive in the form of free tranport , housing benefit and so on ? If one sought to compare the value of an Irish state pension with an English one it benefits an Irish man only if he buys his beer in this country .
		72. I was going to say that I intended to treat the right hon and learned Lady far more gently than has been the case with the Home Secretary and his spin doctors over the past 24 hours , but in view of her earlier anxieties about what might happen to her career if she is not treated more harshly , that might not be the right thing to say . I return to the important question about the Home Secretary and his expressions of view when arrests take place . It is not merely a question of whether that might be a contempt of court , or prejudicial to a fair trial . The problem is that it could lead to the embarrassing possibility that it is suggested in court that a fair trial might be prejudiced . Does the Solicitor - General agree that every Minister , and the Home Secretary in particular , ought to have that very much in mind before they express any view on a matter that is subject to police investigation ?
		73. Does the Minister agree that the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 provides the right special measures to support vulnerable and intimidated witnesses so that they can give the best evidence possible ?
		74. I thank my hon Friend for that answer and congratulate Ministers on their success in the negotiations . Does my hon Friend agree that the British Government have guaranteed that there will be no compulsory time limit for working hours , and that that has been welcomed by employers throughout the European Community ? [ Laughter . ]
		75. Eight hundred and seventy people took up an apprenticeship in Rugby last year , which is an increase of more than 50 % since the general election . These are young people who are starting on a process that is vital to them and to the country . Does the Minister agree that , in the same way as for those completing a degree , graduation - style ceremonies should be encouraged as an important way of recognising their achievements ?
		76. Does my hon Friend agree that the competitive advantage of lower fuel oil costs will quickly be squandered if pay claims in manufacturing industry continue to be settled at levels above the rate of inflation ?
		77. An analysis by the Charities Aid Foundation found that small and medium - sized charities reported deficits of more than £ 300 million in 2011 , and that the situation had markedly deteriorated since 2010 . Does the Minister agree that the finances of the voluntary sector , like the economy as a whole , have indeed markedly deteriorated since 2010 ?
		78. This feels like groundhog day—nothing ever seems to change . Every time the Labour party brings this issue to the House , we hear the same statements , questions and scaremongering . Does the Secretary of State agree that we hear nothing new from the Labour party ? All we hear is the same scaremongering—nothing new , no new thinking .
		79. Does my hon Friend agree that the deeply irresponsible policy that has been set out from the Opposition Front Bench may not be unconnected with the fact that the hon Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe ( Mr. Morley ) receives no less than £ 15,000 per annum from an animal rights group ?
		80. Does my right hon Friend agree that local authorities should allow pension funds to pay for tarmacking the second runway at Manchester airport so that councils are free to spend more on schools and caring for the vulnerable ?
		81. Does my right hon Friend agree that when people donate money , they want that money to be spent on the services provided by the charity , and that most people in this country would be shocked at the amount of money spent on administration and lobbying ?
		82. Does the Prime Minister agree that the major announcements made by the Secretary of State for Innovation , Universities and Skills on apprenticeships , and particularly adult apprenticeships , will be very welcome to my constituents in Blackpool , and particularly to women returning to work after 15 or 20 years ? Does the Prime Minister believe , like me , that that marks a huge contrast with what the Conservative party did in its last five years in government , when it put money into neither apprenticeships nor further education ?
		83. As my hon Friend says , for every pound we spend on the NAO , the NAO saves the taxpayer £ 18 . The Comptroller and Auditor General has been very pessimistic in his budget estimation for next year in seeking to reduce his budget . Does my hon Friend agree that , given that we get £ 18 back for every pound we spend on it , we should spend more on the NAO , not less ?
		84. Does the Minister agree that Britain can not stop or divert the rest of the Community taking what they believe to be the next logical steps " ? Those were the words of the Deputy Prime Minister , writing in 1989 .
		85. Does the Prime Minister agree first , that the supply of weapons to the states of the former Yugoslavia should be choked off and not increased and secondly , that arms and equipment dealers who may wish to dabble there , and their friends , no matter how well connected , will not find a safe haven in Great Britain ?
		86. Does my right hon Friend agree that it is well understood in the west midlands that the Government wish to dispose of Wytch Farm and to encourage exploration in the North sea , but that those who are dependent upon lower oil prices would not wish the Government to give the impression that they can influence the price of oil so as to keep it up and would much rather that the Government state more clearly that the price of oil is dependent upon market forces ?
		87. Does the Minister agree that illegal shipments of arms from Libya to the IRA played a vital role in prolonging the terrorist campaign ? Now that we are reopening diplomatic and other relations with Libya , and Libya is giving information about its weapons of mass destruction , surely Colonel Gaddafi owes it to us to give us details about those illegal shipments . Does the right hon Lady agree that that would help the decommissioning process ?
		88. Does my hon Friend agree that the ability of a health and wellbeing board to represent democratically the interests of the people in its area would be boosted by having a reasonable number of councillors on it with both geographical representation across the area and political balance ?
		89. Many on the Opposition Benches strongly agree that there should be a strategy in which the UK is involved to strengthen countries in order to stop their people wanting to flee . However , far more should be done by the UK to allow more people in , and one process would strengthen the other . Does the Minister agree ?
		90. The Secretary of State will be aware that among the very best performers in GCSEs this year were the schools run by ARK - Absolute Return for Kids - and by Lord Harris . They did up to four times as well as other comprehensives . The people running those schools say that their success depends on absolute freedom from local bureaucratic control . Does the Secretary of State agree ?
		91. Yesterday I launched a new all - party parliamentary group for marine energy , to promote the fantastic potential from our tumultuous seas of energy , whether tidal , stream or wave . Does my hon Friend agree that when the Hendry review comes out in November this year , the Government should respond as fast and as positively as possible to make us a world leader in what could be one of the great sources of energy in the world ?
		92. Social care is vital for reducing winter pressures on the NHS by helping to keep older people out of hospital , but the Government are cutting funding for older people ’s social care by £ 1.3 billion . Delayed discharges from hospitals are already up 11 % from this time last year . The Minister responsible for care said in Westminster Hall on 10 November : “ cuts to front - line adult social care services are really beginning to bite.”—[ Official Report , 10 November 2011 ; Vol . 535 , c. 178WH . ] Does the Secretary of State agree ?
		93. Does the Secretary of State agree that following the local and European elections and the conclusion of the judge - led inquiry into on - the - runs at the end of May , all Northern Ireland parties should see it as their top priority to reach a speedy agreement on the issues covered by the Haass talks ? Three years of elections in Northern Ireland can not lead to permanent political logjam .
		94. Does the Chancellor agree that increasing the personal allowance again will mean that a basic rate taxpayer in my constituency will pay £ 600 less tax in cash terms as a result of the measures taken by the Government ?
		95. Does my hon Friend agree that we have demonstrated a commitment to the Welsh language , with even more people speaking it and being encouraged to speak it , without feeling that their Government and the people who look after them are not interested in it ? Since 2003 , the Assembly has invested £ 28 million in achieving the goal of a truly bilingual Wales and I think that we should applaud that .
		96. Seventeen hundred hard - working families in my constituency have also benefited from the working families tax credit . Does my hon Friend agree that working tax credits will build on the enormous success of the working families tax credit and get more people into work ?
		97. Does my right hon Friend agree that it is now becoming clear that the major difference between the unilateralists and the multilateralists is that the unilateralists want peace at any price , whereas the remainder of us would view the sacrifice of freedom as too high a price to pay ?
		98. Does my right hon Friend agree that excellent regional universities—for example , the University of Northumbria at Newcastle and Sunderland—are anxious that they will be at a disadvantage if an élite group of universities , mainly in the south - east of England , are allowed to raise their fees to figures upwards of £ 10,000 a year , as today 's newspapers reported the Minister for Lifelong Learning and Higher Education as saying ?
		99. Does my right hon Friend agree that the sad events in the Lebanon in recent weeks have clearly shown the impotence of United Nations peacekeeping forces and that when consideration is given to the security of British territory in the future that must be borne very much in mind ?
		100. The Prime Minister has stated that Brexit means Brexit , and the First Minister of Scotland has stated that , for us , remain means remain . Does the right hon and learned Gentleman agree that the Scottish people have spoken and that therefore their sovereignty should be respected ?
