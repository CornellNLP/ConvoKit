# Friends Dataset

This README will contain dataset details.

## Setup

Create a virtualenv, ideally called `py3/`. This should get your local python3 installation.

```cli
pip3 install virtualenv
virtualenv py3/
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Then for each time you want to use it, activate the environment and then install the dependencies:

```cli
source py3/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
