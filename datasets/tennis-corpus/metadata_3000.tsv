1681_0	Yeah.	1681_0.a	2008-08-28	M	1681	nan	Kei Nishikori	I think this is your biggest success right now, first Grand Slam, third round.	1681_0.q	126.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1681_1	Yeah, I'm pretty happy, but it was -- I wasn't playing well today, but he retired, and I was just lucky, guess.	1681_1.a	2008-08-28	M	1681	nan	Kei Nishikori	How would you describe it? Is it fantastic for you?	1681_1.q	126.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1681_2	No, no. I didn't know, no.	1681_2.a	2008-08-28	M	1681	nan	Kei Nishikori	Do you know why he has retired?	1681_2.q	126.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1681_3	Um, because there is more players, top players. Many pros are practicing there, and many coach.	1681_3.a	2008-08-28	M	1681	nan	Kei Nishikori	Could you tell us a little bit yourself? You practiced at the Bollettieri Academy. Why did you choose that academy?	1681_3.q	126.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1681_4	Oh, because the one, the guy helps me, his name is Mr. Morita. He send me there, yeah.	1681_4.a	2008-08-28	M	1681	nan	Kei Nishikori	But you could choose, also, another one. Why did you choose Bollettieri?	1681_4.q	126.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1681_5	When I was 13, so almost five years now.	1681_5.a	2008-08-28	M	1681	nan	Kei Nishikori	How old have you been when you went...	1681_5.q	126.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1681_6	What do you mean, contract?	1681_6.a	2008-08-28	M	1681	nan	Kei Nishikori	Okay. And how is the contact with Mr. Bollettieri at the moment, for example?	1681_6.q	126.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1681_7	Yeah.	1681_7.a	2008-08-28	M	1681	nan	Kei Nishikori	Contact with him. I mean, do you speak with him after such a big victory, for example?	1681_7.q	126.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1681_8	Congrats. I haven't talked to him yet, so... Yeah.	1681_8.a	2008-08-28	M	1681	nan	Kei Nishikori	What does he say?	1681_8.q	126.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1681_9	I don't know why he retired, still. But he wasn't moving well. Seemed his legs, I guess.	1681_9.a	2008-08-28	M	1681	nan	Kei Nishikori	Did you get any sort of sense of why he retired? Did he seem to have an injury, or do you know what was in his mind?	1681_9.q	126.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1681_10	I tried to go to the net more often, because he was using slice a lot. I tried to make more first serve. He get more pressure when I hit, when I make first serve. Yeah, tried to go aggressive.	1681_10.a	2008-08-28	M	1681	nan	Kei Nishikori	Can you just talk about your match today, how you played.	1681_10.q	126.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1681_11	Twice a year.	1681_11.a	2008-08-28	M	1681	nan	Kei Nishikori	How much time do you spend in Japan in a year, for example? Are you just staying in the States, or are you sometimes in Japan?	1681_11.q	126.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1681_12	One tournament, and two, three weeks of vacation in November or December.	1681_12.a	2008-08-28	M	1681	nan	Kei Nishikori	And just for a week or...	1681_12.q	126.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1681_13	Yeah, but they come to tournament sometimes. Like here, they're here now, too. They came Wimbledon.	1681_13.a	2008-08-28	M	1681	nan	Kei Nishikori	And your parents, they still live in Japan?	1681_13.q	126.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1681_14	Yeah, but many friends went with me, Japanese guy. So I wasn't -- I wasn't like homesick. But now sometimes I get homesick.	1681_14.a	2008-08-28	M	1681	nan	Kei Nishikori	How hard was it for you when, 13 years, left your parents, left Japan to go to the States. Was it a big step for you?	1681_14.q	126.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1681_15	Yeah. Two guys and one coach, as well.	1681_15.a	2008-08-28	M	1681	nan	Kei Nishikori	Other players from Japan went with you to the States?	1681_15.q	126.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1681_16	They're in college in Japan.	1681_16.a	2008-08-28	M	1681	nan	Kei Nishikori	Where are they now? Are they still...	1681_16.q	126.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1681_17	College.	1681_17.a	2008-08-28	M	1681	nan	Kei Nishikori	Japan?	1681_17.q	126.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1681_18	Yeah.	1681_18.a	2008-08-28	M	1681	nan	Kei Nishikori	So you're the only one that stayed?	1681_18.q	126.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2886_0	I doubt that. I mean, he's quite young and he still have future in front. It was good for him beating Ljubicic here. I was a bit more lucky to pull it out.	2886_0.a	2010-09-03	M	2886	Ryan Harrison	Sergiy Stakhovsky	There were some unhappy people at the USTA office. You broke their hearts here.	2886_0.q	36.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2886_1	You mean when I'm 6-3?	2886_1.a	2010-09-03	M	2886	Ryan Harrison	Sergiy Stakhovsky	You aced him two straight. Did you feel that that was the breaker at that point, that he didn't return your serve at the end?	2886_1.q	36.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2886_2	No. Facing three match points down, I mean, not much can be done. I mean, if I put two aces, he put one more ace on his serve and it's gone.	2886_2.a	2010-09-03	M	2886	Ryan Harrison	Sergiy Stakhovsky	Exactly, 6-3.	2886_2.q	36.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2886_3	No. It was nothing like that. I mean, he played that tiebreak very well, and he didn't really seem that he's gonna choke or in some way he's gonna underestimate it. So he was playing really well. The mistake he done was actually unexpected from me.	2886_3.a	2010-09-03	M	2886	Ryan Harrison	Sergiy Stakhovsky	When you returned it, did you say, Hey, I put this one in play; he's gonna probably crack it?	2886_3.q	36.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2886_4	It was nice, I mean, except that 99.9% of the people were against me. But yes. (Laughter.)	2886_4.a	2010-09-03	M	2886	Ryan Harrison	Sergiy Stakhovsky	What was the overall atmosphere like out there?	2886_4.q	36.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2886_5	Well, I mean, I've played Davis Cup, so I quite know the atmosphere is going around. So there's nothing can be done about it. I mean, people supporting one person, you just can't tell them, Guys, cheer for me. But I'm glad that they did really appreciate some nice points we played. They really clapped for both sides more or less, so it was fair.	2886_5.a	2010-09-03	M	2886	Ryan Harrison	Sergiy Stakhovsky	That's gotta be a learning experience.	2886_5.q	36.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2886_6	Well, actually the longer rain delay wasn't any good for me because I felt more stiff when I got back on the court. I was a bit, I would say, dead. (Laughter.) So it was really hard time for me to get back into the rhythm, and he used it. I've done some big mistakes on my serve and he broke me. He just took his chance.	2886_6.a	2010-09-03	M	2886	Ryan Harrison	Sergiy Stakhovsky	How did the rain delay affect you? You came out and held your serve, but then obviously he came back.	2886_6.q	36.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2886_7	Yeah, but, I mean, that was bad. I mean, I hit it hard. I just missed -- completely missreturned [sic], and I hit it hard. I saw the guy just fell off the chair there. I felt sorry for him.	2886_7.a	2010-09-03	M	2886	Ryan Harrison	Sergiy Stakhovsky	The crowd did cheer for you when you shook the cameraman's hand.	2886_7.q	36.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2886_8	Well, the thing is that when you're facing a player that you never seen playing before, you always -- you know, you don't know what you can expect. And if he's beaten Ljubicic in the first round in four sets, then your expectations are going up a bit bigger. It's not easy to beat Ivan on hardcourt. So basically he played the way I expected. So he come in a lot, he got a great serve, moving around really well. It was really long and tough match today.	2886_8.a	2010-09-03	M	2886	Ryan Harrison	Sergiy Stakhovsky	How surprised were you by Ryan? How much had you seen of him?	2886_8.q	36.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2886_9	Well, to do good to him, I'm not gonna say any good of him. Because usually, you know, when the young guy's coming up, I mean, and they have all this publicity and everybody saying they're gonna be, they're gonna be, they're gonna be, and in the end they're just losing it. So I would say he got a huge amount of work to do. Huge amount. (Laughter.) Like hours and hours of practice. But he got a reputation.	2886_9.a	2010-09-03	M	2886	Ryan Harrison	Sergiy Stakhovsky	What do you think of his potential?	2886_9.q	36.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2886_10	No. Actually I cannot believe -- I can't really be angry in myself in the fifth set, because I've done two mistakes on my serve; I lost it when I was a break up. I've done one mistake in tiebreak, and I was 6-3. I can't really say I was playing or I missed some easy shots which put me in that position, so I just lucky to pull out winner in the end.	2886_10.a	2010-09-03	M	2886	Ryan Harrison	Sergiy Stakhovsky	Are you still a little bit stunned that you did win this match in the end after being down three points after the back and forth and back and forth that it kind of ended so quickly in your mind?	2886_10.q	36.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2886_11	It was not easy. If I would say that, I just spend another eight hours on court in the last three days again, and today was another four hours. So it was not easy at all. It was just a lot of pressure, and they were screaming. And then when the court was slippery they started booing. I understand everything, but I don't understand booing when the court is slippery and you can twist your ankle. People just don't understand it.	2886_11.a	2010-09-03	M	2886	Ryan Harrison	Sergiy Stakhovsky	How hard was it with the crowd? You may have answered this already. I came in late.	2886_11.q	36.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2886_12	I don't remember. I have a short memory, but I don't remember I had any big matches like this in my junior career, because I didn't have that much chances to get any big tournament as a junior, unfortunately.	2886_12.a	2010-09-03	M	2886	Ryan Harrison	Sergiy Stakhovsky	Do you remember a match where you lost when you were younger, maybe you had a chance to win that you really learned form that really helped you later on?	2886_12.q	36.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2886_13	More or less you know what you can expect. It's great that Americans are supporting their players hard. But I mean, it's part of the game.	2886_13.a	2010-09-03	M	2886	Ryan Harrison	Sergiy Stakhovsky	Do you have to tell yourself when the crowd is going like that, Okay, it's just because he's an American; it's nothing personal?	2886_13.q	36.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2886_14	No, I doubt that there was many people from post Soviet Union in my match. I don't really think that -- I heard some people cheering in Russian, so I don't know. Maybe 20, maybe 50. But if there's 50 against, I don't know, how big is Grandstand? Couple of thousand. So not easy.	2886_14.a	2010-09-03	M	2886	Ryan Harrison	Sergiy Stakhovsky	Do you think part of it also is you're from the Ukraine and they pulled out the old war words come back?	2886_14.q	36.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2886_15	Well, I would say it's a turning point for my Grand Slam career, because unfortunately before I was not able, or due to bad draws, I would say. But it's an excuse. I was unable to pass through two rounds. So for me it's a great opportunity to play third round. I would say it's a huge turning point in my career, because New Haven was the second title this year. I had one before. It was my fourth in total, so I do have some experience in that. I'm still now looking for my game, still trying to get better in the game I'm playing.	2886_15.a	2010-09-03	M	2886	Ryan Harrison	Sergiy Stakhovsky	You come in coming off the win in New Haven, and you've reached for the first time your third round in a Grand Slam. If I'm not mistaken, do you feel now at 24 years of age coming in with, I would think, confidence off the New Haven win and now, you know, coming into the third round, do you feel right now this is a big turning point in your career?	2886_15.q	36.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2886_16	Um, not really. I'm just -- as long as I'm on court I'm just trying to win, more or less, and I'm trying to win every point, or, you know, sometimes put a little show in there. But I'm just trying to enjoy it. I'm just trying at the moment not to be angry on myself if I'm losing.	2886_16.a	2010-09-03	M	2886	Ryan Harrison	Sergiy Stakhovsky	Coming off the win, do you feel right now that your own expectations of yourself has risen?	2886_16.q	36.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2886_17	Yeah, I do.	2886_17.a	2010-09-03	M	2886	Ryan Harrison	Sergiy Stakhovsky	So you're enjoying yourself?	2886_17.q	36.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2886_18	Second serve, I think. Seriously, I don't know if it was soft or not soft. I know he missed it and that was enough for me.	2886_18.a	2010-09-03	M	2886	Ryan Harrison	Sergiy Stakhovsky	When he was serving at match point, are you surprised he didn't try and hit a harder serve?	2886_18.q	36.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2886_19	For me or for the other guy?	2886_19.a	2010-09-03	M	2886	Ryan Harrison	Sergiy Stakhovsky	You have a very unique style of play. You have a similar style to your opponent today. What is complicated? What complicates that style of play for you?	2886_19.q	36.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2886_20	In his game?	2886_20.a	2010-09-03	M	2886	Ryan Harrison	Sergiy Stakhovsky	For you.	2886_20.q	36.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2886_21	It's very physical, because if you serve and volley a lot, you need to really, first of all be focused, and then secondly you have to be fit. Running forward is actually sometimes harder than running side to side. After four hours, it's not easy at all. You still have to be focused to finish that volley, which I didn't actually in the fifth set couple of times. So just a little physical. And seriously, you have to be in every point. Because I mean, you just can't miss two easy shots, and, Oh, I got to get back in the rallies. You have to put that serve in and you have to finish it.	2886_21.a	2010-09-03	M	2886	Ryan Harrison	Sergiy Stakhovsky	No, just with your own game. It's very precise. You come to the net.	2886_21.q	36.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2886_22	The game is not giving too much rhythm to the opponent. Unfortunately, Ryan is playing the same style. We were having no rhythm and we were serving good. So I mean, our rallies were not so interesting, I would say, from the baseline as the other matches. But that was just due to because two players of the more or less same style faced each other.	2886_22.a	2010-09-03	M	2886	Ryan Harrison	Sergiy Stakhovsky	But like you also used the slice a lot and the chip in dropshots; you were hitting a bunch of dropshots.	2886_22.q	36.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2886_23	Once again, I just think that...	2886_23.a	2010-09-03	M	2886	Ryan Harrison	Sergiy Stakhovsky	So what would you say or what would your reaction be to people who would say it would be very refreshing to see your style of play and your matchup against Ryan today? Any comments on that?	2886_23.q	36.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2886_24	Well, I wouldn't say it's been dominating. The tennis in the past ten years get really physical, and really everybody is moving very well around the court. It's not easy to play, let me say soft balls in tennis these days. I mean, if you just play it short, the guy is just gonna kill it. They don't really give a damn if you play a slice or spin it. When I'm playing good, more or less when I'm feeling the ball good, it's not easy for them to play against me. But then, you know, if you have a bad day or just played a half meter short or just a meter shorter than usually, then they just dominate you. They move you around the court, and after one set you're burned out.	2886_24.a	2010-09-03	M	2886	Ryan Harrison	Sergiy Stakhovsky	The game has been dominated largely by power baseliners for a decade. What is your comment about people who would say you guys are bright lights for a very exciting, different style of play?	2886_24.q	36.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1016_0	Yeah, it was very tough for me, especially that I've been here all day and wasn't really ready and was -- I felt very flat on the court and very tight.  Not motivated enough. I just didn't have that inside of me, especially in the first two sets.  Then it turned inhe third set finally and I start -- you know, I wanted to win really bad and I said to myself, I'm going to give what I have and I will come through this match as a winner.  I'm not going to give up.  No matter what, I will do this and this is what I did. I played a lot better in the third set and managed to get through.  But I just was struggling and the balls were a little bit heavier because it was nighttime and quite humid.  It was different conditions out there and especially for being here all day, I was quite exhausted.  I had to drink coffee before the match to stay awake.  Even now I'm like falling asleep.	1016_0.a	2007-09-02	F	1016	Sybille Bammer	Jelena Jankovic	So what happened out there in that match?	1016_0.q	3.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1016_1	No.  But I just didn't know what to do.  My eyes were closing.  I couldn't manage it.  I said to my to the people from my team, Oh, God what am I supposed to do?  Just my reactions are very slow.	1016_1.a	2007-09-02	F	1016	Sybille Bammer	Jelena Jankovic	Is that unusual for to you drink coffee before a match?	1016_1.q	3.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1016_2	I practiced around 1:00, and the physios they tape me around 2:00.  They tape my blister and they were surprised it stayed the whole day.  Waiting and warming up a few times for my match, and just hang around the locker rooms.  It was very bad but at the end of day I'm very happy.  When you come up as a winner you don't care what happened.	1016_2.a	2007-09-02	F	1016	Sybille Bammer	Jelena Jankovic	What time did you get here?	1016_2.q	3.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1016_3	Yeah, in the third set I let down.  I had a chance.  And I came back in the second set, I was down love-3, and then managed to come back in that set, and then I just let my opportunities slip away, and I was very frustrated with myself that I let it go.  I should have been done already an hour ago, but I didn't do the right thing and play the right game I was very flat. I thought I was waiting for her to give it to me and it just didn't happen.  I was kind of sluggish from side to side.  Not the best from my side.  But third set I get into it and I said, I will do it no matter what.  I'm just going to hang in there and move my feet and swing at the ball a lot faster and I'm gonna play aggressive and I'm gonna win.  Aggressive. I found this kind of energy inside of me and that's what I did, I came back.  Even I was tired and didn't feel the best, and I kind of motivated myself to get through and that's what I did. And also thanks to the crowd.  I had good supporters around the court and they kind of also lifted me to give my best when I really was struggling out there.  I thought maybe I cannot make it, but I did.	1016_3.a	2007-09-02	F	1016	Sybille Bammer	Jelena Jankovic	Last year you were against Henin your brain sort of froze on you.  It backfired on you.  Tonight, completely different circumstance but you stayed mentally strong.  Do you look upon that as something you were really concentrating, This time I'm going get through this?	1016_3.q	3.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1016_4	Yeah, when you're winning matches and you're not playing your greatest tennis, it's a good thing, but I would love, you know, if I would win in two sets and play great tennis and get out of this place as soon as possible, and not being with you guys at midnight.  That's the last thing I want to do. But when you win a match, you don't care what time you play it or whatever.  If I lost I would be very frustrated.  I wouldn't sleep all night.	1016_4.a	2007-09-02	F	1016	Sybille Bammer	Jelena Jankovic	You had a difficult match in the last round as well, is this going to affect your confidence going forward?	1016_4.q	3.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1016_5	Because out of three matches that were on my court, two matches were five sets.  As I warm up I think that the guys will finish, and then all of sudden the other guy comes back.	1016_5.a	2007-09-02	F	1016	Sybille Bammer	Jelena Jankovic	What was the hang-up today?  Why did you go on later than you thought?	1016_5.q	3.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1016_6	I didn't understand why they didn't move me to Arthur Ashe because they finished that match around 5:00.  They started the night match, I was in the suites resting, and I saw Henin go out at 7:20 or something, and I said I could have been done by the time she went on court because it was around 5:00, 5:15.  Even if I played two hours, they would go on court 7:30. Then I waited and went on the court the same time as Djokovic and he was second after 7.  I'm like oh, God, am I going survive this and drinking coffee.	1016_6.a	2007-09-02	F	1016	Sybille Bammer	Jelena Jankovic	Was there any chance of them moving you to another court?	1016_6.q	3.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1016_7	No, didn't bother me, but I just didn't know what to do when I'm half asleep.  Like my eyes were kind of closing and I felt very slow motion.  You know, because you been around the courts at this place for almost like 12 hours.  What do I expect from myself?	1016_7.a	2007-09-02	F	1016	Sybille Bammer	Jelena Jankovic	First of all, did the coffee bother you at all?	1016_7.q	3.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1016_8	I don't know, but that's what I've been doing lately.  I won a lot of matches, and this year I have quite big record, and I feel quite confident when it comes to the tight situations.  I feel that I can get through this even when I'm not at my best.  That's what helps me, being confident, winning all these matches.  So I feel I can get through no matter what.  Even if I'm not at my best and really struggling out there, very tired and, you know, maybe I have some pains or blisters or whatever I have, I don't think about that; all I care is to win the match no matter what.	1016_8.a	2007-09-02	F	1016	Sybille Bammer	Jelena Jankovic	Have you in the past in your career been good at winning matches when you didn't feel good?	1016_8.q	3.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1016_9	I have no idea.  I just want to win everything.  I just don't care.  Nothing else is in my mind except winning.  That's all I care about.  I never think about losing.  Whoever I match up against, except for Justine for some reason, I cannot, you know, say that I'm winning against her.  That's the only one I have been struggling against.  But she's a No.1 player in the world and I cannot complain.  She's better for sure. But I'm working very hard to improve on my game and to add some things in my game.  Staying mentally tough is always important.  But I have a lot of improvement to do mentally, physically, everywhere in my game.  I have to keep going and maybe one day I'll reach No.1, maybe No.2.  Who knows what I'm doing.	1016_9.a	2007-09-02	F	1016	Sybille Bammer	Jelena Jankovic	How have you come forward since playing Justine here last year?	1016_9.q	3.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2722_0	I don't know why he say that?	2722_0.a	2010-04-13	M	2722	Julien Benneteau	Fernando Verdasco	Julien said he felt like a bull in the bullring on the court today. What is your take on that?	2722_0.q	12.0	1	2nd Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
2722_1	Well, I was just try to play my game, try to get used to the clay court as soon as possible, playing deep with spin, like, you know, run and fight, you know, like normally you must play on clay court. Maybe he was also a little bit tired from yesterday. He have a three-set match yesterday, and it was my first match today. So maybe it was a little bit different about that. But I play good. I play good. I think I did a good match. I don't know how he felt today. But I was feeling good. You know, I was just trying to play my best here and trying to get the level from last year on clay court.	2722_1.a	2010-04-13	M	2722	Julien Benneteau	Fernando Verdasco	He felt like you were playing around with him.	2722_1.q	12.0	1	2nd Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
2722_2	Well, I didn't make like unbelievable winners, but I played very solid. I didn't make unforced errors. I made some, but not a lot. And I play good, no? I play like with good style on clay. So, you know, that make me happy, no, with my match. I was practicing like this. So, you know, my expectations was to play like this, to play the same that I was practicing, not to play worse that I was practicing, no? So what I didn't expect is the result. I didn't expect to win 6-2, 6-1, but I was expecting to play like today.	2722_2.a	2010-04-13	M	2722	Julien Benneteau	Fernando Verdasco	Did you expect to play so well for the first match this week?	2722_2.q	12.0	1	2nd Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
2722_3	Well, maybe. I play there three matches. I was practicing clay just two days before the tournament because I got there maybe three days before the tournament. And, you know, it was different. Now I have - I don't know, today is Tuesday, and I start practicing on clay last Sunday. So more than a week. Is different than Acapulco. But, you know, I think that like I had more time than in Acapulco, and also maybe that tournament helped me to get the rhythm easier and faster.	2722_3.a	2010-04-13	M	2722	Julien Benneteau	Fernando Verdasco	Do you think that you played Acapulco makes your adaptation faster on clay court or you think it's no connection?	2722_3.q	12.0	1	2nd Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
2722_4	I do it in Miami, I think. Yeah, in America. Why? Because, you know, we were like watching many brands. I tried Yonex. But I was with problems in clay court. So finally we took the decision to don't keep playing with Yonex. And then in the United States, the USA, I tried Dunlop. But still we are trying to get a better racquet, no? So we are working on it. But I decide to sign with them for four years I think. I don't know, four or five.	2722_4.a	2010-04-13	M	2722	Julien Benneteau	Fernando Verdasco	When and why have you signed a new endorsement with the racquet with Dunlop?	2722_4.q	12.0	1	2nd Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
2722_5	Yeah.	2722_5.a	2010-04-13	M	2722	Julien Benneteau	Fernando Verdasco	Are you comfortable with this one?	2722_5.q	12.0	1	2nd Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
2722_6	You know, I think we are still working together with the racquet. I hope to get like the perfect racquet for Roland Garros. That's the goal.	2722_6.a	2010-04-13	M	2722	Julien Benneteau	Fernando Verdasco	Better than the last one?	2722_6.q	12.0	1	2nd Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
2722_7	The chances on clay from the French players?	2722_7.a	2010-04-13	M	2722	Julien Benneteau	Fernando Verdasco	Can you talk about the French guys, their level since the beginning of the season, and what are their chances on clay?	2722_7.q	12.0	1	2nd Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
2722_8	Well, I think that they have like many good players. They are in a great level. But, yeah, maybe they are more like hard court players normally than clay court players. At the same time they could play also good on clay. Benneteau did quarterfinals in Roland Garros one year. Tsonga last year. You know, they are like so talent players, almost all the French guys. So I think that they can do it good in all the surface. But normally they get adapt easier I think for the hard court, no, like Benneteau, Llodra, like Tsonga, Simon, almost all of them. But I think that they can do also good results on clay.	2722_8.a	2010-04-13	M	2722	Julien Benneteau	Fernando Verdasco	Yes.	2722_8.q	12.0	1	2nd Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
2722_9	I don't know. I don't know how they are mentally. I don't speak about that with them.	2722_9.a	2010-04-13	M	2722	Julien Benneteau	Fernando Verdasco	Talent is one thing, but what do they have to improve the most? Their mental and physical?	2722_9.q	12.0	1	2nd Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
2722_10	You know, I think they have one style of game, and maybe, like I said, they play more flat than you supposed to play on clay court. I don't really know. I also don't like to speak about another players.	2722_10.a	2010-04-13	M	2722	Julien Benneteau	Fernando Verdasco	But sometimes if you have to face them...	2722_10.q	12.0	1	2nd Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
2722_11	Now he's injured. But if you put all the French players on the best shape, hundred percent, I think he's the one who made better results on clay. He did semifinals in Paris, and last year quarters, no? So I think also his style of game is more for clay. He's so solid on the baseline, he's so fast. Also he play like with more spin than maybe Benneteau, Llodra, Tsonga even. But Tsonga, he has very good serve, very good forehand. With this he can win matches in all surfaces. But I think Monfils, if I have to say one, I will take Monfils for clay, if I need to take a partner for my team. It's not just like play his tennis, but if I need to do it.	2722_11.a	2010-04-13	M	2722	Julien Benneteau	Fernando Verdasco	Would you say at this moment Monfils has the best chance on clay of the French?	2722_11.q	12.0	1	2nd Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
2213_0	Well, definitely I'm disappointed. But I cannot expect winning players like Venus and Serena playing like I played. You know, I gave my best both matches, but I don't feel great. I mean, I don't feel the ball like, for example, I felt in Beijing, you know. I didn't play the great tennis, and that's why I lose.	2213_0.a	2009-10-29	F	2213	Venus Williams	Svetlana Kuznetsova	What do you think about this match? It was a tough match.	2213_0.q	3.0	0	Round Robin	SONY ERICSSON CHAMPIONSHIPS	SEC
2213_1	I just don't feel it. I have my reasons, but I don't really want to talk about it (smiling).	2213_1.a	2009-10-29	F	2213	Venus Williams	Svetlana Kuznetsova	There is no reason why?	2213_1.q	3.0	0	Round Robin	SONY ERICSSON CHAMPIONSHIPS	SEC
2213_2	I have to. It's not if I can. I have to do that. I have to go and play. I'll do my best. Definitely it's going to be hard. But I like playing her. Is going to be tough match. But I know if I play right, I going to have opportunities. I hope to take them.	2213_2.a	2009-10-29	F	2213	Venus Williams	Svetlana Kuznetsova	You have tomorrow a tough game. It won't be easy for both of you. Can you focus on your game to win and maybe to pass to the semifinals?	2213_2.q	3.0	0	Round Robin	SONY ERICSSON CHAMPIONSHIPS	SEC
2213_3	It's okay.	2213_3.a	2009-10-29	F	2213	Venus Williams	Svetlana Kuznetsova	Are you ready physically for tomorrow?	2213_3.q	3.0	0	Round Robin	SONY ERICSSON CHAMPIONSHIPS	SEC
2213_4	Yes.	2213_4.a	2009-10-29	F	2213	Venus Williams	Svetlana Kuznetsova	No problem?	2213_4.q	3.0	0	Round Robin	SONY ERICSSON CHAMPIONSHIPS	SEC
2213_5	I have no idea (laughter). You ask me question, I answer. But I have no idea, I win, I lose. I know if I win, maybe I have a chance. I have to see. But if I lose, definitely no chance. But, you know, I have a tough group. I think I played three tough matches. It's much more positive than my past Championships. I think I know what to improve.	2213_5.a	2009-10-29	F	2213	Venus Williams	Svetlana Kuznetsova	Are you sure you can be in the semifinal, even if you win?	2213_5.q	3.0	0	Round Robin	SONY ERICSSON CHAMPIONSHIPS	SEC
2213_6	Definitely I will ask. I'm just curious how it works. If I lose, there's no chance. Everybody except Serena has two losses and one win. It's going to be curious.	2213_6.a	2009-10-29	F	2213	Venus Williams	Svetlana Kuznetsova	But you prefer to just play without counting?	2213_6.q	3.0	0	Round Robin	SONY ERICSSON CHAMPIONSHIPS	SEC
2213_7	You know, if I say I'm not, winning a Grand Slam title, I gonna be...	2213_7.a	2009-10-29	F	2213	Venus Williams	Svetlana Kuznetsova	Are you happy with your performance? Are you satisfied with your performance by the end of this year?	2213_7.q	3.0	0	Round Robin	SONY ERICSSON CHAMPIONSHIPS	SEC
2213_8	I mean, I saved season by winning French Open and Beijing. This is how I put it better. But the other tournaments was not so good.	2213_8.a	2009-10-29	F	2213	Venus Williams	Svetlana Kuznetsova	I mean after the Grand Slam, after French Open.	2213_8.q	3.0	0	Round Robin	SONY ERICSSON CHAMPIONSHIPS	SEC
4754_0	I don't know what's wrong. I think I played a really good match today. Was close. I think was a great battle. Well, at the end was really tough because I just start to feel some things in 43 on the third set on my ankle and on my adductor. Well, after that was really tough and he start to play better and better and he is the winner.	4754_0.a	2013-01-22	M	4754	David Ferrer	Nicolas Almagro	The leg obviously is giving you a fair bit of grief. What's wrong with it?	4754_0.q	11.0	0	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4754_1	Cramping?	4754_1.a	2013-01-22	M	4754	David Ferrer	Nicolas Almagro	So you tore something rather than cramped?	4754_1.q	11.0	0	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4754_2	I don't know really, but I need to check with my doctor right now after the press conference. But I think I don't feel a really good feeling.	4754_2.a	2013-01-22	M	4754	David Ferrer	Nicolas Almagro	You tore the adductor?	4754_2.q	11.0	0	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4754_3	Well, I think was tough because I couldn't serve really good because I was serving with all my body, with full power. After that, 43 in the third, I start to miss a lot of first serve. I think when you play second serve with David, was really tough to beat him. Well, I don't want to think about that because it's just 10 minutes I finish the match. Maybe I have time to think tomorrow or later. Not now.	4754_3.a	2013-01-22	M	4754	David Ferrer	Nicolas Almagro	Take us back to the three opportunities to serve for the match. How frustrating was that to have that chance and not get it done?	4754_3.q	11.0	0	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4754_4	I don't want to think about that. He is the No.4 of the world. He is the favorite. He beat me many times, but many matches were close.	4754_4.a	2013-01-22	M	4754	David Ferrer	Nicolas Almagro	The career record now against Ferrer, is that really starting to bother you?	4754_4.q	11.0	0	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4754_5	I don't know if it was or not. But I remember in Cincinnati few years ago I was set up and 65 returning for the match, and I had three or four match point. But today was a big opportunity for me. Well, I gonna work to be ready for the next.	4754_5.a	2013-01-22	M	4754	David Ferrer	Nicolas Almagro	Was this the closest today?	4754_5.q	11.0	0	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4754_6	When you don't feel really good you start to think many things, but...	4754_6.a	2013-01-22	M	4754	David Ferrer	Nicolas Almagro	You said you did the injury in the first set. Was it hard to get out of your head in the second and third sets?	4754_6.q	11.0	0	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4754_7	Well, I don't know if it's that moment, the most important moment of the match or not. I feel pain during all the end of the third set and fourth set. There was many, many chance. After that he return every point and was really tough to win a point. I'm disappointing with the tiebreak, but I need to work more to be ready to play with the top players.	4754_7.a	2013-01-22	M	4754	David Ferrer	Nicolas Almagro	Did you suffer a separate injury in the tiebreak?	4754_7.q	11.0	0	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4754_8	If you not 100% to play, I don't know if it's mentally or not. I think I tried to play my best tennis today. I say few days ago with my last press conference I will try to play aggressive, I will try to play my best tennis, and I think I did today. Is not enough to beat David. But we'll see what happen in the future. I am ready to work and we'll see. I don't know. I don't want think that it's a mentality problem. If I have mentality problem, I think I didn't win the first two sets.	4754_8.a	2013-01-22	M	4754	David Ferrer	Nicolas Almagro	Until 54 in the third set, your average speed on the first serve was 200 kilometer per hour. You were basically perfect with the service, forehand, backhand. What happened mentally next?	4754_8.q	11.0	0	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1300_0	Well, I played a good first set, actually.  I was well into the match and played very aggressive and I did a good job in the first. And yeah, then lost a little bit of the intensity, a little bit of the rhythm on my serve.  Then I was leading 5-2 and then she came back and didn't move her -- it wasn't good enough at that time to finish the match. And then when she came back at 5-All I understood it was time to push myself a little bit more.  And I know in the next round it's going to be a good match for me to push myself and really come to another level.	1300_0.a	2008-01-16	F	1300	nan	Justine Henin	Was that second set a wakeup call?	1300_0.q	1.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1300_1	Well, it's never really been a problem in the past.  I'm not a big fan of the first rounds in the Grand Slam, but you must win them.  Today I can complete the match a little bit earlier, and I didn't.  And, yeah, I just tried to stay focus on the main goals, important things, get ready for the next match.	1300_1.a	2008-01-16	F	1300	nan	Justine Henin	Is it always a problem, motivation a problem in your game?	1300_1.q	1.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1300_2	I didn't see what happened.  I heard that this morning, but I didn't see what happened.	1300_2.a	2008-01-16	F	1300	nan	Justine Henin	What do you make of the incident last night with the Capsicum spray and the police?	1300_2.q	1.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1300_3	Oh, not really, no.  No, not at all.	1300_3.a	2008-01-16	F	1300	nan	Justine Henin	So it doesn't dent your view of the tournament?	1300_3.q	1.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1300_4	Well, I didn't hear about that, but it's true that it's long.  It would be better for everyone if it could go faster, but I don't know the procedure and how it's working.  So I'm not an expert like to talk about that and to really give my opinion of -- I don't know how long it could take, and I think that, yeah, I don't have any real comment to do about that.	1300_4.a	2008-01-16	F	1300	nan	Justine Henin	Larry Scott talked the other day a little bit about provisional suspensions with doping, so between the first sample and the second sample, instead of waiting until the B sample comes back instead of announcing provisional suspensions earlier.  I'm wondering if you feel like the way the doping protocol is set it takes too long between when a player tests and they're notified?	1300_4.q	1.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1300_5	Yeah, it's long, but what can we say?  I don't know how it's working, so you better ask the authorities.  I'm not an expert on that.	1300_5.a	2008-01-16	F	1300	nan	Justine Henin	For instance, if Martina Hingis, she tested in July and she found out in September it came out.  It's a long time.	1300_5.q	1.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1300_6	I think as soon as you are tested positive you should be suspended at that time.	1300_6.a	2008-01-16	F	1300	nan	Justine Henin	Do you feel a player should be suspended before their side's been heard?	1300_6.q	1.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1300_7	Yeah, it's a Grand Slam that I really like, but all Grand Slams are important to me.  Maybe Wimbledon little bit more because it's the only one I never won, but I'd love to win every Grand Slam two times, so, hey, it means a lot to me. I hope I can have great results here and in the future, this year and in the next years, but Wimbledon remains the one that all the attention is going to be on myself because it's the only one I never won. And here, I really love being here and I think it's a great atmosphere, so I really, really like it a lot.	1300_7.a	2008-01-16	F	1300	nan	Justine Henin	We all know that Wimbledon is very important to you, but could you talk about the significance of this Slam for you, given the fact you were gone last year and the year before you had to retire?	1300_7.q	1.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1300_8	Nothing.	1300_8.a	2008-01-16	F	1300	nan	Justine Henin	How much did you watch last year, if any, of this tournament?	1300_8.q	1.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1300_9	No.  Maybe a few games of a men's match, but, no, nothing.  My mind was somewhere else.	1300_9.a	2008-01-16	F	1300	nan	Justine Henin	Nothing?	1300_9.q	1.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1300_10	Not really.  Maybe a year later, now that it's seems so far away from me, I can say I missed the tournament.  But I can tell you in January a year ago I really didn't miss my tennis at that time because there were more important issues in my life. So it's just a question of priorities and how you feel at that moment, so I didn't want to watch because tennis wasn't important anymore for me at the time.	1300_10.a	2008-01-16	F	1300	nan	Justine Henin	Was it deliberate?  Did you feel you would miss it too much if you watched?	1300_10.q	1.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
2798_0	I just needed more support on this leg today. I had her come out and give me more support, and that helped.	2798_0.a	2010-04-03	F	2798	Kim Clijsters	Venus Williams	Saw you were playing with the bandages after the first game. The trainer came out. Seemed like new bandages. Is that a new injury on that leg?	2798_0.q	5.0	0	The Final	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Premier
2798_1	I think the extra tape helped.	2798_1.a	2010-04-03	F	2798	Kim Clijsters	Venus Williams	Any affect on your play, the injury?	2798_1.q	5.0	0	The Final	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Premier
2798_2	Yeah, you know, it just seemed like unfortunately I -- you know, sometimes when you hit a few bad shots it's not as easy to reel it in, and things start to go a little bit quicker. You know, every now and then it happens to the best of us. I think this happened to Kim in Australia, so I think she knows what it's like. Wasn't the best day, but that's, I guess, sport sometimes. Of course, I expect a lot from myself, but I'll be ready for my next competition.	2798_2.a	2010-04-03	F	2798	Kim Clijsters	Venus Williams	Have you ever had such a frustrating day when your strokes won't behave?	2798_2.q	5.0	0	The Final	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Premier
2798_3	No, I think -- you know, I think it was more or less my groundstrokes. I mean, on my serve I go for it a lot, so that's kind of the norm. I mean, I did start missing more first serves in the second set, so that didn't help my cause.	2798_3.a	2010-04-03	F	2798	Kim Clijsters	Venus Williams	Were you having timing issues with the serve today?	2798_3.q	5.0	0	The Final	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Premier
2798_4	I don't ever feel like it's not my day. I don't think that way.	2798_4.a	2010-04-03	F	2798	Kim Clijsters	Venus Williams	How were you in practice? Were you sensing it wasn't your day?	2798_4.q	5.0	0	The Final	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Premier
2798_5	I mean, obviously just against a player like Kim, if you make too many errors, you know, the match can go quickly. I mean, I think she hit eight winners, so it wasn't -- she played extremely solid, but it's not like I was blown off the court. Unfortunately I was my own worst enemy today.	2798_5.a	2010-04-03	F	2798	Kim Clijsters	Venus Williams	So you felt good at the start of the match? When did you start not feeling right?	2798_5.q	5.0	0	The Final	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Premier
2798_6	Should it be a concern of mine?	2798_6.a	2010-04-03	F	2798	Kim Clijsters	Venus Williams	Your power is a great asset. With the clay coming up there's a premium on consistency. Is that a concern with your groundstrokes at this stage?	2798_6.q	5.0	0	The Final	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Premier
2798_7	I was just wondering what you thought.	2798_7.a	2010-04-03	F	2798	Kim Clijsters	Venus Williams	Well, that's up to you to answer. Depends how well you felt you were hitting it.	2798_7.q	5.0	0	The Final	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Premier
2798_8	Overall, I believe in me and my game. So no matter what the surface, I'm ready to play.	2798_8.a	2010-04-03	F	2798	Kim Clijsters	Venus Williams	Well, overall.	2798_8.q	5.0	0	The Final	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Premier
2798_9	No. I mean, it has to come from within for me. Just has to come from within.	2798_9.a	2010-04-03	F	2798	Kim Clijsters	Venus Williams	At one point did you consider like a T.O. talk to a coach, Serena, dad, anybody?	2798_9.q	5.0	0	The Final	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Premier
2798_10	I mean, at all points I'm thinking about getting back into the match. That's what I'm here for: to play and to win. But, you know, maybe I should have went for a little less. Even when I was down I was still going for the shots. Maybe that wasn't the exact right mentality today. Like I said, she played really consistently. Maybe she didn't play a lot of winners, but she did try to force an error. So it was smart. Sometimes when your opponent is not playing as well it can throw you off. But, you know, she played smart to just get the ball in play.	2798_10.a	2010-04-03	F	2798	Kim Clijsters	Venus Williams	What are you feeling when the match is going so quickly like that and just nothing is going right? How did you keep playing? What keeps you going? What are you thinking or feeling at that point?	2798_10.q	5.0	0	The Final	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Premier
2798_11	Today wasn't my best day physically. To fight errors and not feel your best, it's a really mental battle. But, um, mentally and physically you have to fight out there at all times.	2798_11.a	2010-04-03	F	2798	Kim Clijsters	Venus Williams	Physically today how far off from 100% were you?	2798_11.q	5.0	0	The Final	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Premier
2798_12	No. No. Same thing last year with her. She had a tough match, too. But, um, we always encourage each other.	2798_12.a	2010-04-03	F	2798	Kim Clijsters	Venus Williams	Ever feel like throwing Serena your racquet?	2798_12.q	5.0	0	The Final	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Premier
2798_13	I'll definitely take a rest now.	2798_13.a	2010-04-03	F	2798	Kim Clijsters	Venus Williams	You have a few weeks off now. Do you rest the knees and not go on the court? Do you start practicing right away?	2798_13.q	5.0	0	The Final	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Premier
2798_14	It's an unspecified time at the moment (laughter.) But I will take a rest and get ready for the clay court season.	2798_14.a	2010-04-03	F	2798	Kim Clijsters	Venus Williams	How long?	2798_14.q	5.0	0	The Final	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Premier
2798_15	I don't think she wants to talk to me about Fed Cup right now. (Laughter.) Wouldn't be the best answer right now. I think she has been smart enough not ask me about Fed Cup. I'm sure she'll come and say hi, but she'll wait a few days until I'm feeling a little better and a little less in the moment.	2798_15.a	2010-04-03	F	2798	Kim Clijsters	Venus Williams	Have you managed to talk to Mary Joe...	2798_15.q	5.0	0	The Final	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Premier
2798_16	To be honest, I always want to play Fed Cup. I mean, to be honest, my goal was to see how I felt physically after this tournament. I do want to play and support the United States. Also, I think it would be nice to have the matches, too. So obviously I will have to make a decision pretty quickly. We'll see soon.	2798_16.a	2010-04-03	F	2798	Kim Clijsters	Venus Williams	What's your reaction?	2798_16.q	5.0	0	The Final	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Premier
2798_17	Well, what's wrong is that I needed the support. Like my knee, sometimes they need the support. At times more than others. So that's really what happened.	2798_17.a	2010-04-03	F	2798	Kim Clijsters	Venus Williams	What is it exactly that's wrong with the left leg?	2798_17.q	5.0	0	The Final	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Premier
2798_18	It was like needing supportiveness.	2798_18.a	2010-04-03	F	2798	Kim Clijsters	Venus Williams	Was it in pain?	2798_18.q	5.0	0	The Final	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Premier
2798_19	I think sometimes you have to be careful with practice, not to practice too long. I may have made a mistake with that a little bit. I know better, but Eager V kind of burst through. Overall I'm really happy with the tournament. Unfortunately, today I didn't win the match, although I feel like this is a match I can win. Unfortunately I made it a little bit too easy. Next time around I'll play better.	2798_19.a	2010-04-03	F	2798	Kim Clijsters	Venus Williams	It was in pain. Does it often get worse through a tournament. Do you feel that by the semifinals?	2798_19.q	5.0	0	The Final	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Premier
2798_20	Oh, yes, we're still in that stretch. Still in the feeling-good stretch.	2798_20.a	2010-04-03	F	2798	Kim Clijsters	Venus Williams	You just said the other day that you hadn't had a very long stretch where your knee felt good. Are we still in that stretch?	2798_20.q	5.0	0	The Final	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Premier
2798_21	Yeah, I mean, they're playing really, really well. This is just great and amazing for them. They're playing great.	2798_21.a	2010-04-03	F	2798	Kim Clijsters	Venus Williams	Is it surprising to see how well Kim has done after her comeback and Justine to just be able to go through a lot of top-ranked players right off the top?	2798_21.q	5.0	0	The Final	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Premier
2798_22	Yeah. The support from the crowd was great. It was unfortunate that I couldn't give more today. I was just unable to push today as much as I wanted. I just couldn't. I tried. I just was unable. But it was good to feel the support. Still mentally I was thinking to find a way to get into the match.	2798_22.a	2010-04-03	F	2798	Kim Clijsters	Venus Williams	Did you feel the support from the crowd when they started cheering when you were down in the second set?	2798_22.q	5.0	0	The Final	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Premier
2798_23	I eat a lot less, because I spend a lot of time eating a lot of food that I don't want to eat. So I skip meals. This is probably bad, but it's a splurge for me. For most people it's a splurge to eat more, but it's a splurge for me to skip meals. And I stay up late because I don't have to go to bed early. So that's what I do when I have time off.	2798_23.a	2010-04-03	F	2798	Kim Clijsters	Venus Williams	What do you do when you take time off? How do you spend your time off?	2798_23.q	5.0	0	The Final	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Premier
2798_24	I stay down here. It's a rather long drive. It can be a lot of traffic.	2798_24.a	2010-04-03	F	2798	Kim Clijsters	Venus Williams	Do you drive from home to your matches?	2798_24.q	5.0	0	The Final	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Premier
2798_25	Scary.	2798_25.a	2010-04-03	F	2798	Kim Clijsters	Venus Williams	Oh, yeah, a lot traffic today.	2798_25.q	5.0	0	The Final	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Premier
1428_0	Yeah, you know, I just hurt my back, and obviously I've gone down this road before.  I was debating before, you know, you never know, like, okay, I will go out there and maybe it will loosen up. It was pretty obvious to me after two games that I was pretty sore out there, and it was quite hard to rotate.  Obviously with playing tennis you need your rotation, so, you know, I tried to do the best I could.  But sometimes these things happen, and when you're familiar with an injury, you kind of know right away what you're up against.	1428_0.a	2008-03-20	F	1428	Jelena Jankovic	Lindsay Davenport	What happened?	1428_0.q	36.0	0	Quarterfinals	PACIFIC LIFE OPEN	1
1428_1	Yeah, it was injured before I came here and I got it better, got it better, and then this morning woke up and just couldn't move.  I actually don't know what caused it, but, you know, I got here at 9:30 this morning, was with the trainers for three hours or something before I played, and I was hopeful that with all the medication I took and the treatments, but just didn't happen.	1428_1.a	2008-03-20	F	1428	Jelena Jankovic	Lindsay Davenport	You didn't hurt it out there then, you hurt it in practice?	1428_1.q	36.0	0	Quarterfinals	PACIFIC LIFE OPEN	1
1428_2	Lower to mid.	1428_2.a	2008-03-20	F	1428	Jelena Jankovic	Lindsay Davenport	Lower back, upper back?	1428_2.q	36.0	0	Quarterfinals	PACIFIC LIFE OPEN	1
1428_3	I hurt it the first time the Saturday before tournament.  I came out here Sunday.  Was getting treatment, and everything.  It got way better and was manageable.  I literally have no idea what happened, but I woke up this morning and was not able to move again.  The joints were stuck and the muscles had spasmed a little bit. They did a really great job of getting me through the tournament and getting me out there today.  It just -- I guess it just needs to heal.	1428_3.a	2008-03-20	F	1428	Jelena Jankovic	Lindsay Davenport	So when exactly did you hurt it?	1428_3.q	36.0	0	Quarterfinals	PACIFIC LIFE OPEN	1
1428_4	Yeah, it's so hard to say, because, you know, I've been playing now for nine, eight months maybe, or seven months, and this was the first real injury I've had.  Which in my book is pretty good.  In someone else's book maybe not so good. But I'm hopeful because it did get better, you know, for the last 10 days that it will clear up and I'm able to play again hopefully in Miami.  We'll just have to see what the next few days brings.	1428_4.a	2008-03-20	F	1428	Jelena Jankovic	Lindsay Davenport	You've been down this road before, so just talk about what you think is going to happen during the next few weeks.	1428_4.q	36.0	0	Quarterfinals	PACIFIC LIFE OPEN	1
1428_5	It's not so fresh, body's not so fresh anymore.  But, yeah, it's exactly what happens.  You know, I think I've played a relatively smart schedule, but coming back from Australia and going right into Fed Cup, couple weeks then to Memphis then to here. It's just a lot of tennis, and the older you get obviously it's no surprise that it's tougher to come back week after week.  But I'm hoping it was just kind of the one-off injury and not due to fatigue, and hopefully if I get it better and it will heal up.	1428_5.a	2008-03-20	F	1428	Jelena Jankovic	Lindsay Davenport	Does it sort of bring it back home again?  I'm back on the tour now, injuries are back?	1428_5.q	36.0	0	Quarterfinals	PACIFIC LIFE OPEN	1
1428_6	I want to play, and I definitely want to play when it's in the States.  These are the tournaments I was really looking forward to, and thought I timed it pretty well with playing some smaller tournaments before playing the bigger tournaments. When I finished the other night against Bartoli I felt fantastic.  I mean, it was late, but I felt really good.  I thought I hit the ball well.  I was ready to go.  You wake up on a morning like this and the body just doesn't cooperate.  I think I'll obviously deal with that more now being in my 30s, but I haven't given up hope completely yet.	1428_6.a	2008-03-20	F	1428	Jelena Jankovic	Lindsay Davenport	It's a real balancing act for you, too, right?  Because you need the matches?	1428_6.q	36.0	0	Quarterfinals	PACIFIC LIFE OPEN	1
1428_7	No.  I mean, as an athlete you get injuries all the time.  Like I said, this was the first one I've had to deal with, and I've got some experience in that. The only thing that's tough is with a back injury I can't hold my son.  So it's been a tough couple weeks in that regard.  Haven't been able to lift him up out of his crib, out of the stroller, out of the car seat. So I felt -- I've been feeling like kind of a bad mom in that regard.  So I'm hoping it gets better in the next few days and not be just the mom giving orders to everybody.	1428_7.a	2008-03-20	F	1428	Jelena Jankovic	Lindsay Davenport	Does something like this make you question whether attempting to balance tennis and motherhood was wise?	1428_7.q	36.0	0	Quarterfinals	PACIFIC LIFE OPEN	1
1428_8	Well, I mean, my decision on Miami will come in the next few days before I'm supposed to leave and see how it feels.  It's so hard, because literally I was feeling really well until I woke up this morning.  So I don't want to be too dramatic and say, you know, that I can't play right now. But having said that, it did respond well like 10 days ago, so I'm hopeful.  And then just have to play everything by ear after that.  Obviously my schedule was to play in the States in Miami and Amelia Island.  If that's not possible, obviously I'll relook at it and probably play a little bit more in Europe than I had anticipated.	1428_8.a	2008-03-20	F	1428	Jelena Jankovic	Lindsay Davenport	What's the timetable before you make your decision about Miami?  And how much will the Fed Cup affect that decision about playing Miami?	1428_8.q	36.0	0	Quarterfinals	PACIFIC LIFE OPEN	1
1428_9	It kind of works both ways.  This tournament meant a lot to me.  That would be up there with those, because -- just of all my memories here and being in being California and being so special to me. Having said that, if you would ask me, you know, two weeks ago if I would get this far and feel as well as I did throughout the tournament, I'd be ecstatic with where I'm at now. But, you know, I still have a lot more positive things coming for the rest of the year.  Those tournaments you mentioned, I'm obviously looking forward to.  That's the beauty about this game.  It's like you have a setback, but you have more opportunities coming your way in the coming months. While I'm obviously disappointed, I'm still looking forward to and excited for the rest of the year.	1428_9.a	2008-03-20	F	1428	Jelena Jankovic	Lindsay Davenport	Because the goal is Wimbledon, Olympics, US Open, things like this probably don't set you back that much, huh?	1428_9.q	36.0	0	Quarterfinals	PACIFIC LIFE OPEN	1
1428_10	I know.  I heard that.  I was really disappointed.  I know that we're trying to talk Venus into it, but, you know, our chances are much more favorable with one or both of them on the team. So I have to fly to Miami just for that reason to attack to Serena.	1428_10.a	2008-03-20	F	1428	Jelena Jankovic	Lindsay Davenport	So what's your feelings on Venus not playing Fed Cup?	1428_10.q	36.0	0	Quarterfinals	PACIFIC LIFE OPEN	1
1428_11	I haven't.  I talked to Venus in Memphis, and she kind of told me there what she was thinking.  I haven't seen Serena since Australia.  Hopefully I'll see her in the next few days.	1428_11.a	2008-03-20	F	1428	Jelena Jankovic	Lindsay Davenport	Have you been texting her or anything?	1428_11.q	36.0	0	Quarterfinals	PACIFIC LIFE OPEN	1
1428_12	I mean, it looks like I have to.  Yeah, that wouldn't be pretty for the U.S., so we'll try.  We'll see if we can make something else work out.	1428_12.a	2008-03-20	F	1428	Jelena Jankovic	Lindsay Davenport	Are you actually willing to play singles on clay if...	1428_12.q	36.0	0	Quarterfinals	PACIFIC LIFE OPEN	1
1428_13	Yeah, well, I know she can do better.  (laughter.)  I actually didn't think she even had another dance, and someone told me that they dance again on Monday.  So, yeah, I think -- I hope she does better. Still, it's so difficult to go out there and do something you're completely unfamiliar with.  I couldn't even walk across this room in high heels, let alone try and do a dance number. So, you know, it's going to take her some time.  Hopefully in the next few days her and her partner will come up with a good -- I think if they do a Salsa or Samba or something.  She'll come out all spicy for that.	1428_13.a	2008-03-20	F	1428	Jelena Jankovic	Lindsay Davenport	What were your thoughts on Monica's performance the other night?	1428_13.q	36.0	0	Quarterfinals	PACIFIC LIFE OPEN	1
1428_14	Yeah, they're good matches.  I mean, I know Jankovic plays Ivanovic and Maria plays Kuznetsova.  Yeah, top four seeds.  Good matches.  I don't know too much about the rivalry between Ana and Jelena.  Sometimes when you're from the same country there's a lot of history there. I'm not familiar with their history.  I think it will really come down to Ivanovic.  She's the aggressor and how many errors to winners ratio she kind of has, and how many balls Jelena can really dig out and make Ana play. And the same with Maria and Svetlana.  Maria has obviously been playing great this whole year.  She's been really consistent in her kind of aggressive style of play, fighting really hard. But Svetlana likes to mix it up and give her some problems.  I like Maria's chances in that.	1428_14.a	2008-03-20	F	1428	Jelena Jankovic	Lindsay Davenport	Would you mind handicapping the two semifinal matches tomorrow?	1428_14.q	36.0	0	Quarterfinals	PACIFIC LIFE OPEN	1
3092_0	Yeah, it was an incredibly close first set, and obviously had the set point and she hit a ball right on the line. So you have to say, you know, Too good on shots like that. I thought it was a really high-quality match. Yeah, obviously a little bit disappointing not to get a reward for playing so well for that period of time. Yeah, that second set she really played well, and, yeah, deserved to win it in the end.	3092_0.a	2010-10-30	F	3092	Kim Clijsters	Samantha Stosur	The first set came down to a matter of millimeters. I guess you just weren't able to sustain that sort of intensity in the second set; is that how you saw?	3092_0.q	7.0	0	Semifinals	WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS - DOHA 2010	SEC
3092_1	Yeah, for sure. I'm very, very pleased with the way the week's gone here. I thought I played four good matches and gave my best and thought I played really well. So I've got to walk away somewhat happy, I guess. Always a little bit disappointed, but you got to look at it as a whole. I'm pleased with the way that I've played here.	3092_1.a	2010-10-30	F	3092	Kim Clijsters	Samantha Stosur	Overall, are you pleased that you finished the season on such a high to make the semifinals here?	3092_1.q	7.0	0	Semifinals	WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS - DOHA 2010	SEC
3092_2	Yeah, I think it's always important to do well against those kind of players no matter what tournament is. The last one of the year, everyone wants to do well. You always want to finish on a good note rather than a bad one. To be able to do that, it's pleasing.	3092_2.a	2010-10-30	F	3092	Kim Clijsters	Samantha Stosur	How important was it to finish the season with a couple confidence-boosting wins over top 10ers?	3092_2.q	7.0	0	Semifinals	WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS - DOHA 2010	SEC
3092_3	Yeah, it's not too shabby, I guess. (Smiling.) To get through the semis is obviously a lot better than losing in the round, so I did what I could. Unfortunately for me, I got a little bit outplayed today. That's what happens when you play against the best in the world. You have to play absolutely at the peak. If you drop off just that little bit, then you get punished for it.	3092_3.a	2010-10-30	F	3092	Kim Clijsters	Samantha Stosur	And to feel you belonged, too. It's your debut here, and yet you're 2-4, which is a good result.	3092_3.q	7.0	0	Semifinals	WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS - DOHA 2010	SEC
3092_4	Yeah, couple weeks off. Won't do too much. Just go home and enjoy being home and see my friends and all that kind of thing. Start doing some fitness work towards the end of November, and start hitting in December. Quite a big gap now to be able to relax and I guess really reflect on what the year's been.	3092_4.a	2010-10-30	F	3092	Kim Clijsters	Samantha Stosur	What's the plan now? How many weeks off? What do you plan to do?	3092_4.q	7.0	0	Semifinals	WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS - DOHA 2010	SEC
3092_5	Yeah, I'm sure there will be. I haven't thought too much about it yet. I'm sure Dave and I will talk leading up to that and put a bit of a plan together. Yeah, there are definitely things I want to work on and keep improving. So whatever they end up being, we'll go through that and really go hard the pre-season.	3092_5.a	2010-10-30	F	3092	Kim Clijsters	Samantha Stosur	Is there something specific you're going to work on when you get back on the court in December?	3092_5.q	7.0	0	Semifinals	WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS - DOHA 2010	SEC
3092_6	Yeah, I'm very pleased with the way it's all gone. You know, last year I thought was the best year I had on tour, and now this year I've well and truly passed that. So, yeah, it's really pleasing to know that I've been able to sustain it for another year and really be more consistent throughout the whole time and overall play much better tennis. I think I'm always improving as a player, and I think that's showing in the results I'm get asking, and definitely confidence boosting. Hopefully next year can go the same way.	3092_6.a	2010-10-30	F	3092	Kim Clijsters	Samantha Stosur	Obviously your season is only just finished now, but it's been a bit of a dream season for you. I guess you would have taken it at the start of the year.	3092_6.q	7.0	0	Semifinals	WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS - DOHA 2010	SEC
3092_7	Yeah, I've always enjoyed playing there. I feel comfortable on the court. Yeah, again, I like the hot conditions, and maybe have a bit of an advantage doing the whole pre-season in Australia compared to some of the other player. I do like the surface. I think it suits me well. If I'm playing close to my best, then I think I should be able to do well. You know, there's always -- you got to put everything together at that time, and the Australian Open a difficult, as any Grand Slams. So, you know, I look forward to it coming up.	3092_7.a	2010-10-30	F	3092	Kim Clijsters	Samantha Stosur	And the Australian Open, is that the surface that suits you next best after the French, say?	3092_7.q	7.0	0	Semifinals	WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS - DOHA 2010	SEC
3092_8	Um, well, I think she started serving quite well as the match went on. She really hit her corners well and got me kind of out of the court and was able to open it up. The end of that first set and the second set, she started using her backhand down the line more and hit some right on the line right when she needed to, and some close to. Overall, I thought she just played very solid. There's not too many weaknesses in Kim's game. You've got to find them when they're there and really try and take advantage.	3092_8.a	2010-10-30	F	3092	Kim Clijsters	Samantha Stosur	What was Kim's main weapon today?	3092_8.q	7.0	0	Semifinals	WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS - DOHA 2010	SEC
3092_9	Well, I think because of her history, that's probably happened from, you know, back all these years ago. She's a very likable person, and I think Australia has really taken to her. Yeah, I think the Australian public really like her. They like her game, they like her personality, and she's very nice person and good for the sport. So I think no matter where she goes she's pretty well liked.	3092_9.a	2010-10-30	F	3092	Kim Clijsters	Samantha Stosur	Another question already leading up to 2011. Australian Open, we from Belgium, when we come in Australia we often hear Kim being called Aussie Kim. Is that true? Is she still considered like an Aussie?	3092_9.q	7.0	0	Semifinals	WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS - DOHA 2010	SEC
3092_10	I don't know if we do. Sometimes the media might, but not in general.	3092_10.a	2010-10-30	F	3092	Kim Clijsters	Samantha Stosur	But do Aussies use the nickname Aussie Kim?	3092_10.q	7.0	0	Semifinals	WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS - DOHA 2010	SEC
3092_11	I guess there's always that extra element of spotlight on me. But, you know, at the end of day the tennis is the same. You still got to go out there and play the same people on the same size court and everything else. So there are other elements that are a little bit different. But again, I really enjoy the atmosphere down there. You still got to think all those good things that way, anything that might put a bit more pressure or anything like that. So I look forward to it. There's nothing I can really say that's really daunting or that I don't like about playing down there.	3092_11.a	2010-10-30	F	3092	Kim Clijsters	Samantha Stosur	A follow up what you said before about every slam being tough. Does the degree of difficulty increase because it's your home slam, do you think, from experience now?	3092_11.q	7.0	0	Semifinals	WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS - DOHA 2010	SEC
5534_0	Thank you.	5534_0.a	2014-06-20	M	5534	Denis Istomin	Richard Gasquet	Congratulations.	5534_0.q	14.0	1	Semifinals	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	ATP250
5534_1	Yeah, yeah. I played a good match today. It was important, you know, to play well because Denis is dangerous. I tried to serve well. You know, the key on grass is to serve and return well. I managed to do it. I'm very happy with the way I played, because it's always difficult to play on grass. Everything can happen, so you need to be strong on every point.	5534_1.a	2014-06-20	M	5534	Denis Istomin	Richard Gasquet	Clearly the back is completely better?	5534_1.q	14.0	1	Semifinals	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	ATP250
5534_2	Yeah, I need to play every day. That's why I'm very happy, because I can play every day. I have no injuries, no pain. It's important for me. Now tomorrow I can play in the finals. Of course when you play in final it's to win, so I will try my best to do it.	5534_2.a	2014-06-20	M	5534	Denis Istomin	Richard Gasquet	Your confidence must be high both in your physical wellbeing and your form.	5534_2.q	14.0	1	Semifinals	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	ATP250
5534_3	Yeah, I know it will be tough. Both are good guys. Both serve well. It will be a big match for me. But I'm ready for it, and I will try to fight the best I can and we will see what will happen.	5534_3.a	2014-06-20	M	5534	Denis Istomin	Richard Gasquet	Two difficult opponents, either Lopez who has won here or Querrey with a big serve.	5534_3.q	14.0	1	Semifinals	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	ATP250
5534_4	Yeah, it's very good for me. As I said, the most important was here to feel no pain, to feel good, to play 100%. I feel very good with my body, and of course I can play Tuesday in Wimbledon. I play many matches here, so I think I will be ready for Wimbledon. The confidence is going up. Tomorrow it's a final, you know, so it's important to win. I will try.	5534_4.a	2014-06-20	M	5534	Denis Istomin	Richard Gasquet	In terms of your Wimbledon preparations, how do you feel about the fact that you'll be going straight into it? Do you think that's a good thing?	5534_4.q	14.0	1	Semifinals	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	ATP250
5534_5	Yeah, it's never easy. I have a lot of problems with my back, so I'm trying to come back every day. Now I can enjoy the final. I know I work a lot to come back on my physical condition and everything. You know, I want to enjoy tomorrow, yeah, to play the best I can. Of course I hope to, in the future, to have no more injuries.	5534_5.a	2014-06-20	M	5534	Denis Istomin	Richard Gasquet	After such a great season in 2013, how frustrating has it been for to you have to deal with all these injuries?	5534_5.q	14.0	1	Semifinals	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	ATP250
5534_6	Yeah, it's very important. It's one of the biggest tournaments in the world. I did semis one time. I know I can play well there. I will try to do my best. I think I'm in a good form now. I'm feeling better and better and better. So we will see.	5534_6.a	2014-06-20	M	5534	Denis Istomin	Richard Gasquet	How much does Wimbledon excite you in your current form?	5534_6.q	14.0	1	Semifinals	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	ATP250
5534_7	Yeah, it's amazing, really. No rain at all. It's incredible.	5534_7.a	2014-06-20	M	5534	Denis Istomin	Richard Gasquet	The weather has been very kind to you in Eastbourne.	5534_7.q	14.0	1	Semifinals	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	ATP250
5534_8	Yeah.	5534_8.a	2014-06-20	M	5534	Denis Istomin	Richard Gasquet	Are you still working with Sergi Bruguera?	5534_8.q	14.0	1	Semifinals	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	ATP250
5534_9	Well, everything is okay. He knows the tennis very good. He won twice Roland Garros, so he was a great champion. I respect him and I respect what he's saying to me every day.	5534_9.a	2014-06-20	M	5534	Denis Istomin	Richard Gasquet	How has that been going?	5534_9.q	14.0	1	Semifinals	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	ATP250
5534_10	On everything. On physical condition, mental. Mental part is very important in sport. On everything.	5534_10.a	2014-06-20	M	5534	Denis Istomin	Richard Gasquet	Is he working with you more on the technical aspects of your game or...	5534_10.q	14.0	1	Semifinals	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	ATP250
2605_0	Well, I must admit, it wasn't my best match today. I made a lot of mistakes and never really came into the match where I played aggressive. Played a lot of rallies behind the baseline and made a lot of mistakes. But I must admit she played well also. She made me work for every point. She made me play really well. Well, I know it wasn't my best day today. I know I wasn't playing great. So the only thing I could get through this match was to fight for every point, just be ready for a long fight, just try to improve every point, and try to play more aggressive. The rain delays were not that easy, but tried to kept hanging in there, just tried to do what I had to do.	2605_0.a	2010-01-18	F	2605	nan	Yanina Wickmayer	Can you tell us, one set down, 1-6 in the first set, then you came back to win two tough second sets. How did you do it?	2605_0.q	16.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
2605_1	Well, I mean, losing a match is always disappointing, if you've gone through the quallies or not. I know she can play really well. It's not the kind of game I play against very good. So, no, she really made me play really well today, and I think she did a great job.	2605_1.a	2010-01-18	F	2605	nan	Yanina Wickmayer	Would have been very disappointing to have lost the match after having come through the qualifying.	2605_1.q	16.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
2605_2	Well, the first one, well, it wasn't too long, so I just try to stay warm and go on court again. The second one I ate something, since it was a long time I haven't eat. So I went to get some treatment for my back, which was hurting a lot. Warmed up again and went back on court.	2605_2.a	2010-01-18	F	2605	nan	Yanina Wickmayer	What did you do during the rain delays?	2605_2.q	16.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
2605_3	You know, it was a tough time. I've been through a tough time. It was tough for me not knowing when I was going to play again, not knowing what the future will bring. But I kept on practicing, working hard, and trying to put a goal for myself. I was really happy to be back on court. I had a great week last week, won my first title of the year, and played some great matches in the qualifying, which I really enjoyed playing. It was tough, but I think it made me strong. Yeah, it made me a little tougher maybe. Today was a tough fight again. It's only good mentally to get stronger and get tougher also as a person and an athlete. It just makes you stronger.	2605_3.a	2010-01-18	F	2605	nan	Yanina Wickmayer	How difficult was the preparation, coming through qualifying, with the controversy with the suspension?	2605_3.q	16.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
2605_4	What does 'resent' mean?	2605_4.a	2010-01-18	F	2605	nan	Yanina Wickmayer	Did you resent having to play qualifying?	2605_4.q	16.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
2605_5	Well, I'm 16 in the world, so I think I should be main draw. I mean, I've asked myself that question a lot of times. I knew I was going to have to play quallies. I knew it a couple of weeks before, so I could prepare myself for the qualifying matches, which was, in a way, positive. I knew I was gonna play them and I could prepare myself mentally. Had a great preparation in Auckland and was playing well. I had a good few matches here. I rather had them in Sydney, but I had them here. When I played them, I really enjoyed being on court, and I just played my matches the way I wanted to play them. It all came out good.	2605_5.a	2010-01-18	F	2605	nan	Yanina Wickmayer	Did you think it was wrong you had to play qualifying?	2605_5.q	16.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
2605_6	Well, first of all, I didn't know what was gonna happen when I got suspended. I didn't know if I was gonna be here. But then when I hear I could play again, I got a wild card in Auckland, which was great. Those people gave me the chance to compete again. That was great. And I understand in a Grand Slam it's really hard to get a wild card. I asked for it, but I understand that that's really hard for a tournament director to give a wild card to a non-Australian player. So I accepted I had to play quallies. I think for me mentally, yeah, it was good playing them. I got a little stronger, a little tougher mentally. I think it's gonna serve me well in the future.	2605_6.a	2010-01-18	F	2605	nan	Yanina Wickmayer	Did you think a little while ago that you'd get here, play the Australian Open? Were you always confident you would get here?	2605_6.q	16.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
2605_7	Not really. I'm just trying to play my best tennis and stay strong on the court and physically stay healthy. I think those are the two most important things. But I'm really glad the way I handled the quallies and the way I handled my mental on the court. I'm really happy to be in main draw. I'm really glad to pass the first round. I'm really happy I'm still here.	2605_7.a	2010-01-18	F	2605	nan	Yanina Wickmayer	With all you've been through, made you more determined to do well here?	2605_7.q	16.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
2605_8	Well, maybe if you ask me that question tomorrow I'll tell you a different answer, but for now I'm pretty tired (laughter.) Had a long day. Had a long match. Have a day off tomorrow. I hope will be fit to start again in two days.	2605_8.a	2010-01-18	F	2605	nan	Yanina Wickmayer	Do you feel fresh physically, having played quallies?	2605_8.q	16.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
2605_9	Not really. Everybody is pretty supportive of me. Everyone knows how hard I work, how hard I work on court, how hard I practice. So I think everyone has a lot of respect for each other. I think everyone is happy I'm back and I'm playing again. I think I would have the same with anyone else. So I think everyone is really supportive and has shown a lot of respect.	2605_9.a	2010-01-18	F	2605	nan	Yanina Wickmayer	What are the other players saying to you about the suspension? Anybody saying anything?	2605_9.q	16.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
247_0	Well, this year I've been struggling a little bit, I mean, with confidence. I haven't had a great year. I started the year at what was it, I don't know. What did I start the year at?	247_0.a	2015-08-11	M	247	Pablo Andujar	Frank Dancevic	Where do you feel your game is right now overall?	247_0.q	251.0	0	1st Round	COUPE ROGERS	Masters 1000
247_1	127. I struggled a little, but I went down in the rankings a little bit to 260. I felt like leading up to this tournament, leading up to this week, I was actually practicing pretty well, I was playing pretty well. Actually felt like I played better today than I've played in a while, if that says anything. But overall I think I have to build a little bit, I have to get confidence back, I have to win some matches. I have to find that confidence back to start winning. I think that's important. Confidence is a big part of my game.	247_1.a	2015-08-11	M	247	Pablo Andujar	Frank Dancevic	127	247_1.q	251.0	0	1st Round	COUPE ROGERS	Masters 1000
247_2	All week, just leading up to this tournament in practice, I did a lot of work the past 10 days just preparing. Physically and tenniswise, I felt like I improved a couple things in my game, my serve, just my movement, just a couple, little things, little details I feel like I've improved. But that doesn't help winning matches and confidence. I think that's the most important thing for me right now, is just get on a little bit of a roll, win some matches. Whenever that happens, whether it's the next week or the next month, whatever, I feel like that's what I need right now in my game.	247_2.a	2015-08-11	M	247	Pablo Andujar	Frank Dancevic	You mentioned you played a little bit better today than you have in a while. What did you like that you did today?	247_2.q	251.0	0	1st Round	COUPE ROGERS	Masters 1000
247_3	Well, I just feel like there's a difference between, you know, feeling like you're playing great, you know, feeling like everything's amazing, and being stuck at 300 in the world. There's a difference between knowing that you're not playing well, falling, and knowing if you play better, you're going to go back up in the rankings. Right now I'm at the stage where I know I had a rough six months of the year. I didn't play nearly at my level. I just feel like I have it in me. I feel like if I just get my confidence back and play better, play a little bit like I did last year, it's kind of like a snowball effect for me, it can happen really fast. I've kind of had a rollercoaster career, up and down, up and down. I've been in slumps. I was ranked 250 in the world three years ago, three or four years ago. I think I was down to 280 actually. Then I got myself back up into the top 100 within a year and a half. For me it's just a matter of getting some confidence. I felt like the way I was practicing this week, like I had a good chance today against Pablo. But it was tough. He surprised me on court the way he played. I felt like he played really solid, really well. He took away my weapons, which is not good for me. It's not good for somebody to take away your weapons. I think, looking at the stats, it was pretty obvious what I felt, that that's what happened in the match.	247_3.a	2015-08-11	M	247	Pablo Andujar	Frank Dancevic	What is your hunger level right now? You've been at this a long time. Especially this year, not making the slams. What is your hunger level, what keeps you motivated?	247_3.q	251.0	0	1st Round	COUPE ROGERS	Masters 1000
247_4	Yeah, you know, sometimes it's just taking a step back. I feel like I've played a lot more than I usually do this year. I was in Europe playing for a long time. I was there for almost two months, played a lot of tournaments. Came straight from Europe, played two events backtoback. Came over here, right away wanted to do well here, so I started preparing early here. I was here 10 days, I had my fitness trainer from Florida here early. We were doing a lot of work coming up to this event. I feel like I was on the go a lot the last three months. Sometimes you just have to take a step back, you know, take five days, just look back at what was working, what wasn't working, 'cause you can just keep hitting your head against the wall and not be able to go any further. I think it's time just to take a step back and think about, you know, what things I need to work on in my game, the way I want to approach the next six months of the year, make a plan, then go from there.	247_4.a	2015-08-11	M	247	Pablo Andujar	Frank Dancevic	It's easy to understand how you train physically, how you rehab an injury. When you're struggling mentally, can you explain how you work on that, what you do to get that mental strength back.	247_4.q	251.0	0	1st Round	COUPE ROGERS	Masters 1000
247_5	Yeah, I think that's another thing. It's like, you know, I've lost a lot of threeset matches, a lot of close matches, 6 in the third, 5 in the third. It's one of those things where usually I'd win, like, half of them. I would just get through a lot of those matches, which eventually gives you more opportunities to go deeper in tournaments. It's been just a rough year for me, losing a lot of tough matches, close matches. You know what, that's part of being a tennis player, is losing, bouncing back. I mean, I've lost I don't even know how many matches first round this year. But I've come back, you know, tried to figure out the next week. Lost again, came back. I can think of only two decent results I've had in six months. That was making finals of a challenger and qualifying for a Masters Series earlier this year. I was happy with the way I was playing. The rest of the year I was very up and down  or down I should say. But, yeah, I think it's time just to really think about how to approach the next six months, not to go play a tournament next week. I think I have to really think about how I want to approach the year. Physically I feel good, which has always been important for me. Important for anybody really. You know, take it one step at a time. I mean, there's only one way for me to go right now. I'm not defending anything for the rest of the year, so I can only climb back up the rankings (smiling).	247_5.a	2015-08-11	M	247	Pablo Andujar	Frank Dancevic	A lot of your losses were of the more difficult, heartbreaking type. You seem to have won the first set a lot this year. How is that related to the confidence? Obviously you had enough confidence to start with.	247_5.q	251.0	0	1st Round	COUPE ROGERS	Masters 1000
4560_0	Thanks for bringing it up and putting me down. I appreciate that. But, you know, I actually take a lot of positive things out of today. I think it was a great performance for me. It was a little bit unfortunate, but I can only learn from here and move on. I mean, I don't have any regrets when I walked off the court today. That's important to do.	4560_0.a	2012-07-05	F	4560	Serena Williams	Victoria Azarenka	What a beast of a day for you. You had to change your warmup strip on the practice courts this morning, then you lose a major semifinal, and then you're the last player on court and you lose in doubles as well. Horrible day for you today.	4560_0.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4560_1	I was just trying to fight because I knew I was going to have a chance sooner or later. Before that she was playing really well. You know, the serve is just that one difference that makes her you know, brings her to the higher level. So but I just tried to fight, you know, and tried to stay in the moment. If I have a chance, just try to grab it. That's what I did. It was really close, but it wasn't my day today.	4560_1.a	2012-07-05	F	4560	Serena Williams	Victoria Azarenka	In the second set you got your teeth into the match. What adjustments did you make and how proud are you of what you were able to do there?	4560_1.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4560_2	Well, she serves 200. That already makes it difficult. You know, I don't see anybody else serving like this on the tour. You know, she places well. I don't know how many lines I got today. But, you know, there is no point to sit and cry how unfortunate I was because she played great. I just have to give her all the credit because, you know, she did her job. I was just trying to, you know, get the ball back as many times as I could, but it wasn't enough today.	4560_2.a	2012-07-05	F	4560	Serena Williams	Victoria Azarenka	Obviously she served so well, a record number of aces. What is it like to face that? What makes her serve so difficult?	4560_2.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4560_3	You could say that. You never know what could happen. There's no point to talk about. It didn't happen, so just no point to talk about it.	4560_3.a	2012-07-05	F	4560	Serena Williams	Victoria Azarenka	There was a point in the second set where you got the break. If it went to a third, did you feel confident it could turn around?	4560_3.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4560_4	I take one tournament at a time, one match at a time, one day at a time. I think from the beginning of the year I raised the bar so high that for people, when I lose maybe a little bit early, already it's not good enough. But I think for me was a great tournament. It could have been better. Yeah, for sure it could have been better, but it's not. And for me, I already think about my next tournament, my next goals, and that's it.	4560_4.a	2012-07-05	F	4560	Serena Williams	Victoria Azarenka	Early part of the season was amazing. Are you feeling the early season is taking its toll, or are you still taking a tournament at a time?	4560_4.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4560_5	You know, she can say whatever she wants and how she feels. It's because she's the only one who knows how she feels. I know how I feel. I cannot speak for her. For me, I think I stayed pretty even throughout the whole match. But, you know, as I said, I cannot speak for somebody else.	4560_5.a	2012-07-05	F	4560	Serena Williams	Victoria Azarenka	Serena thought her intensity dropped a little in the second set. Is that a bit unkind or was it your intensity increased?	4560_5.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4560_6	I don't know. She seems to play really good against me, so I don't know. I think we both showed good tennis today. But, you know, she was better on this day, you know.	4560_6.a	2012-07-05	F	4560	Serena Williams	Victoria Azarenka	Is she as good a player as she's ever been right now?	4560_6.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4560_7	No. Why would it upset me? You know, you guys make such a big deal out of it, it's a little bit already boring to read all the news. You know, I think everybody does different kind of noises. But, you know, what can you do?	4560_7.a	2012-07-05	F	4560	Serena Williams	Victoria Azarenka	Early in the match the crowd appeared to be laughing almost at some of the noises you make when you unleash your groundstrokes. Did you notice it at all? Did it upset you at all?	4560_7.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4560_8	I've noticed it everywhere. Men also grunt really loud.	4560_8.a	2012-07-05	F	4560	Serena Williams	Victoria Azarenka	We've not noticed that happen on Centre Court here before.	4560_8.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4560_9	Yeah, maybe you weren't at every match.	4560_9.a	2012-07-05	F	4560	Serena Williams	Victoria Azarenka	I meant the crowd's reaction.	4560_9.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4560_10	I go home. I have my brother's wedding on Saturday, which I'm really excited about. From there I'm going to practice and prepare, you know, for the Olympic Games.	4560_10.a	2012-07-05	F	4560	Serena Williams	Victoria Azarenka	The semifinals is a good Wimbledon for you. What do you do next?	4560_10.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4560_11	Well, I think Serena's going to win, but Agnieszka is a very good player. It's not easy to get to the final, so anything can happen.	4560_11.a	2012-07-05	F	4560	Serena Williams	Victoria Azarenka	Who do you like in the final?	4560_11.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4560_12	That's a silly question. I think you know the answer.	4560_12.a	2012-07-05	F	4560	Serena Williams	Victoria Azarenka	Which would give you more pleasure: going to your brother's wedding or playing in a Wimbledon final?	4560_12.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4560_13	No, I think it's going to be just interesting. Nobody knows how it's going to be. So it's kind of new and exciting to see how it's going to turn out. But that's not something that you can wear whatever you want. You can wear your national colors, so there is also kind of a strict regime there. But I'm actually really excited to see some McDonald's or CocaCola in the back of the court. It will be funny.	4560_13.a	2012-07-05	F	4560	Serena Williams	Victoria Azarenka	When you come back for the Olympics you can wear what you like. How do you think that affects the prestige of Wimbledon?	4560_13.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
5206_0	I think the statistics of that really said that I didn't take my chances. But on the other hand, she was serving really well today. I just felt like I was fighting and trying to do the same thing that wasn't working for me today. I kept doing the same kind of thing, you know, the same idea, so that wasn't very smart for me to do. I have to give her credit. She played a great match today for sure. There is no doubt about that.	5206_0.a	2013-08-04	F	5206	Samantha Stosur	Victoria Azarenka	You were 1 of 12 on break points and your return is usually so reliable. What was she doing with her serve that made it that difficult to get the service breaks?	5206_0.q	3.0	0	The Final	SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OPEN	Premier
5206_1	I didn't feel that slow. I just felt like the rhythm for me wasn't there. I didn't try to adjust with the resources that today I had. Because I can play so much better than I did today. No question about that. But on this day I just didn't use my arsenal the right way. That just cost me to make a lot of mistakes. It wasn't bad mistakes, it was just a little bit there. They were minor mistakes, but still a mistake. Doesn't matter how big the out is, it's still out.	5206_1.a	2013-08-04	F	5206	Samantha Stosur	Victoria Azarenka	Did you feel a little flat after the whole week? Played semis yesterday and then quarters, and coming in here you looked for you a little bit slow. Is the body completely there?	5206_1.q	3.0	0	The Final	SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OPEN	Premier
5206_2	I don't think I have to change much. I just have to be a little bit more aware of what I'm doing on the court, what I can do on that particular day, and not find something that's not working. That's something that can easily be handled once you can take action on that. Today didn't happen, but I know how to get out of that.	5206_2.a	2013-08-04	F	5206	Samantha Stosur	Victoria Azarenka	(No microphone.)	5206_2.q	3.0	0	The Final	SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OPEN	Premier
5206_3	Well, I didn't really commit to my return and it wasn't there. It's hard to be technical about it right now. To be honest, I don't even want to think about it right now. It's just things that your mind my right mind of right execution had to be there, and it wasn't there on the important moments.	5206_3.a	2013-08-04	F	5206	Samantha Stosur	Victoria Azarenka	Can you be specific in terms what part of your arsenal that you didn't use on return of serve and your game in general?	5206_3.q	3.0	0	The Final	SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OPEN	Premier
5206_4	"It's not something that it's my ultimate goal. My ultimate goal is to be No. 1.
To be No. 2, it's great. It's definitely one step closer to that. I am never going to take it for granted. But ranking is the last thing I really think about."	5206_4.a	2013-08-04	F	5206	Samantha Stosur	Victoria Azarenka	(No microphone.)	5206_4.q	3.0	0	The Final	SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OPEN	Premier
5206_5	I think I was taking too many wrong kind of decisions or too risky decisions when there was no need to be risky. I didn't try to sometimes stay in the rally. I just wanted to make whatsometimes I can make with eyes closed. Today I didn't do it with open eyes. It's gist that a little bit of stubbornness that worked a little bit against me today.	5206_5.a	2013-08-04	F	5206	Samantha Stosur	Victoria Azarenka	Even outside of the return did you find yourself fighting yourself of the ground even today a little bit groundstrokewise?	5206_5.q	3.0	0	The Final	SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OPEN	Premier
5206_6	I just need to be more aware about what I've done, and I'm fully aware of what I did today. Didn't really click for me on the court, but that's what's good about tennis. There is always next match. It's important what you can learn from what happened today.	5206_6.a	2013-08-04	F	5206	Samantha Stosur	Victoria Azarenka	So fair to say then maybe you just need more matches given that you've only played a couple in the last six weeks?	5206_6.q	3.0	0	The Final	SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OPEN	Premier
5206_7	Oh, no. I mean, I was just joking about that. He doesn't really piss me off. It's just emotions on the court. He's a great person and a great coach and I love him, so there is always fighting sometimes in that kind of relationship. But we get along great.	5206_7.a	2013-08-04	F	5206	Samantha Stosur	Victoria Azarenka	When you talked to your coach, did he piss you off again? You remember you said that yesterday.	5206_7.q	3.0	0	The Final	SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OPEN	Premier
5206_8	I'm thinking about it.	5206_8.a	2013-08-04	F	5206	Samantha Stosur	Victoria Azarenka	I take it you're playing in Toronto. I should ask, are you playing in Toronto?	5206_8.q	3.0	0	The Final	SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OPEN	Premier
6176_0	No. No, I didn't underestimate her; I underestimated the weather, those matches that were going on before us, and especially yesterday. I think overall it was so tough to, you know, stay calm and positive and wait for, you know, those matches to be done. We didn't know when we were going to be on, and then finally 8:00 we went on after waiting for like ten hours in the club. It's not easy to be so active and so focused. I had that problem last night especially. She started off so well. She was hitting the ball so great and played an unbelievable match. I played against her in Toronto last year, and it was as well a tough match. Today and yesterday as well it was very tough. She was hitting the ball so hard and did not make many mistakes. I was able to somehow manage to get through.	6176_0.a	2014-05-27	F	6176	Sharon Fichman	Jelena Jankovic	Did you underestimate her?	6176_0.q	7.0	1	1st Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6176_1	She did some really good dropshots. You know, I'm quite fast. I was not able to get them, so they were pretty good.	6176_1.a	2014-05-27	F	6176	Sharon Fichman	Jelena Jankovic	Does she have the best dropshot in the world?	6176_1.q	7.0	1	1st Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6176_2	I focus on myself and my results. I don't look at other players, what they do. It's nice that the Serbian players are doing well and that we can be in the top again. As far as is comes for me, I'm focused on myself. I never compare myself to anyone. I try to do my best and be the best player I can be.	6176_2.a	2014-05-27	F	6176	Sharon Fichman	Jelena Jankovic	With you back in the top 10 and Ana Ivanovic now knocking on the door, is that motivating to see how well she's doing?	6176_2.q	7.0	1	1st Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6176_3	Maybe we could do it again. That would be cool. That would be cool. 2008 was a good year for both of us: I finished No.1 in the world; she won the French Open. So that was really good for both of us. Hopefully we can do it again this year and go far. That would be really awesome.	6176_3.a	2014-05-27	F	6176	Sharon Fichman	Jelena Jankovic	Do you have memories of the 2008 semifinal against her and playing against her? I think you did a photo shoot with the Serbian flag in front of the Eiffel Tower.	6176_3.q	7.0	1	1st Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6176_4	Yeah, three slams I'm playing against her.	6176_4.a	2014-05-27	F	6176	Sharon Fichman	Jelena Jankovic	You are going to play Kurumi in the next round; it's going to be three slams in a row.	6176_4.q	7.0	1	1st Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6176_5	Yeah, she's a very solid player; she gets a lot of balls back. I have to play my tennis, my game, and we'll see how it goes.	6176_5.a	2014-05-27	F	6176	Sharon Fichman	Jelena Jankovic	How did you see that matchup?	6176_5.q	7.0	1	1st Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6176_6	the first time on clay, yes.	6176_6.a	2014-05-27	F	6176	Sharon Fichman	Jelena Jankovic	Last two times you played on hard court against her, and this time it's going to be	6176_6.q	7.0	1	1st Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6176_7	I love playing on clay, so it suits my game. I don't know what's her favorite surface. I enjoy playing on it. It will be our first match against each other on this surface, so different conditions, different courts. Like I said, I will just go out there and try to play my tennis hopefully better than in the first round and just overall improve everything and be more relaxed and positive and have better focus. We'll see. Hopefully it will go well.	6176_7.a	2014-05-27	F	6176	Sharon Fichman	Jelena Jankovic	Yes. So how do you think it affects the match and the game plan?	6176_7.q	7.0	1	1st Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6176_8	I yell all the time, so... I yell all the time. I cannot concentrate and just I just pick one thing that bothered me. There were quite a lot of things that were going on over there. No, I was losing, and when things don't go well you're always looking for something that bothers you. You don't feel good in your skin overall. No, but there is nothing wrong. Basically it's my mistake. It's the time that I'm not playing well and being ahead in the match that's bothering me the most. Everything else, the peripheral side, doesn't matter. It's all up to me. I do not blame anyone else. It's all me.	6176_8.a	2014-05-27	F	6176	Sharon Fichman	Jelena Jankovic	Two things: First thing is what were the people doing in the corner of the court last night that was getting you so aggravated? You went over to yell at them. What were they doing?	6176_8.q	7.0	1	1st Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6176_9	I did; I took it off.	6176_9.a	2014-05-27	F	6176	Sharon Fichman	Jelena Jankovic	The second question is do you think because the weather and the circumstances that you were never going to get to reveal your new dress that had been talked about since Indian Wells?	6176_9.q	7.0	1	1st Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6176_10	It's so cold here and I started to sweat quite a lot. I said, Okay, I'm going to take it off. But I could not focus very well with all the things going on, waiting around for so long yesterday, for quite the whole day. We went on court at 8:00 in the dark. Really, to be honest. I had a problem just staying awake. I had quite a lot of coffees, and my eyes I needed to be alert and just ready to go, quite active; I could not make that happen. My opponent was way more kind of hyper and playing so well. She was all over the place. I was like in slow motion. So today was a little bit better, but still I was not able to sleep well. I was a little bit nervous. I needed to start off very well today and hopefully win that third set, so overall quite a lot of things going on in my mind. It's not easy first round of a Grand Slam and playing an opponent that was playing so well. She was just striking the ball amazingly. She didn't have anything to lose, and it was tough for me.	6176_10.a	2014-05-27	F	6176	Sharon Fichman	Jelena Jankovic	Finally you did, yeah.	6176_10.q	7.0	1	1st Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6176_11	Yeah, 3All was I down a break point? I think I was. I was down a break point and I came up with finally some good serves. I wasn't able to hold my serve after winning the first game of the third set. I was always being broken and broken and broken. Finally 3All I was down a break point and I came up with some great serves, the best ones today, and I was able to hold and finally finish that match off. So that was a good game for me. Otherwise being down 43, she's serving, the momentum is changing, and that wouldn't be a good situation.	6176_11.a	2014-05-27	F	6176	Sharon Fichman	Jelena Jankovic	What happened at 3All? Seemed the match ended very quickly. It was so close and then...	6176_11.q	7.0	1	1st Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
4934_0	Yeah, I'm definitely really happy. I didn't expect it's going to come so fast after my tough preseason, first tournament of the year and I would go so far and beat such a great players. But I'm really, really happy that I could manage to pull this match through. She is definitely a great fighter and she defends a lot, so I had to be aggressive today the whole match.	4934_0.a	2013-01-03	F	4934	Angelique Kerber	Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova	So two very good wins in a row for you. She's a good defensive player, and you hung in there even though it was a little up and down towards the end, no?	4934_0.q	36.0	1	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL	International
4934_1	Yeah, I didn't expect like to be at 60, you know, and then serving for the match. It was too easy. I didn't understand what was going on after like two hours of battling there on the court. Anyway, I said to myself when was 54 down or 65 down, I said, No way I'm going to lose this set. I have to win it in the tiebreaker. So that's how I started my tiebreaker in the second set.	4934_1.a	2013-01-03	F	4934	Angelique Kerber	Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova	So the tiebreaker was pretty good, too. No unforced errors. I think you hit five winners and she was trying to rally, but it seemed like you were the calmer player out there.	4934_1.q	36.0	1	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL	International
4934_2	Well, I'm definitely working on my mental as well because I'm such an emotional person. In the past it was a lot of the matches lost because of, I guess, my emotions. I get really like upset or excited. Every time it's like this. So I'm trying to stay more calm and positive and just focus on my things what I have to do on the court and tactics as well, so that helps.	4934_2.a	2013-01-03	F	4934	Angelique Kerber	Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova	In tight match which could have gone either way, what do you tell yourself to be able to stay mentally calm under that sort of pressure?	4934_2.q	36.0	1	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL	International
4934_3	Well, definitely it's not easy to play the next day after the match she had yesterday. I don't know how she felt, but probably for me I think of course it would be not as easy. But I actually watched her match yesterday, and I thought she increased her level today and I thought she was playing a bit better. Well, actually I didn't feel that she was really tired and playing not well. I thought she was playing good today. Anyway, I was trying to focus more on myself rather than thinking about her.	4934_3.a	2013-01-03	F	4934	Angelique Kerber	Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova	Do you think she might have been a bit down after that two and a half hour match she had yesterday? Do you think her recovery hadn't been enough?	4934_3.q	36.0	1	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL	International
4934_4	Well, yeah, last year was really tough year for me. It was up and down, really annoying. I had a nice rest and then I started over, you know, like clean sheet. I was working on everything, and then little by little I just came here, first tournament of the year, and I was enjoying every match and then just fighting on the court and see how it goes. I'm in the semis right now so I'm happy with this.	4934_4.a	2013-01-03	F	4934	Angelique Kerber	Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova	So you had a very difficult year last year. A lot of downs, a few ups. I know you went back to Mouratoglou. What did you work on in the offseason? Looks like your fitness is better; you were calmer. What do you tell yourself to do? Just talk about that a little bit.	4934_4.q	36.0	1	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL	International
4934_5	Patrick is mostly with Serena. I guess he's communicating with me a bit. He knows me so well because he was working with me since I was 15 or 16. That helps. Yes, Martina Hingis was also hitting with me. Were playing some matches and she was giving some advices. That was really nice.	4934_5.a	2013-01-03	F	4934	Angelique Kerber	Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova	So you're working with Hingis at Patrick's a little bit?	4934_5.q	36.0	1	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL	International
4934_6	Yeah, definitely, because you know, I think the fact that she's a woman as well, and I guess  well, I guess I think women and men mentality is a bit different, especially on the court as well. So it was interesting for me to hear how she felt during the matches as well, what she was going through. So we were talking about this a bit as well during preseason. It's very interesting talking to her as well. She very passionate and she loves tennis.	4934_6.a	2013-01-03	F	4934	Angelique Kerber	Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova	Did she say anything that was particularly helpful to you?	4934_6.q	36.0	1	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL	International
4934_7	Keep playing like this and playing more semifinals of big tournaments, I guess. I actually wasn't thinking about the my ranking at the moment. During preseason I was like, Doesn't matter. I just have to play well and improve my game. Last year I was seeded almost on every tournament and my results were not there, my game wasn't there. So it doesn't really help. It's just a number, I guess. As long as you're playing well and work hard, then the ranking is following.	4934_7.a	2013-01-03	F	4934	Angelique Kerber	Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova	I think you broke into the top 50 in 2008; you're 36 now. What do you think you need to do to get in the top 25?	4934_7.q	36.0	1	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL	International
4934_8	Yeah, we actually were singing together.	4934_8.a	2013-01-03	F	4934	Angelique Kerber	Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova	Did you hit at all with Serena or get to know her a little bit?	4934_8.q	36.0	1	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL	International
4934_9	Yeah, in karaoke. I haven't had a chance to hit with her, but I had a chance to sing with her.	4934_9.a	2013-01-03	F	4934	Angelique Kerber	Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova	Singing?	4934_9.q	36.0	1	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL	International
4934_10	We sing I don't remember exactly. Few songs that also Martina was there. You know, group singing.	4934_10.a	2013-01-03	F	4934	Angelique Kerber	Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova	What did you sing?	4934_10.q	36.0	1	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL	International
4934_11	Yeah, we both good, I think. Yeah, she loves karaoke and I love karaoke. I've been singing since I was little. I'm not as good but I like to sing and I'm trying to do it well. But they're much older with Martina so they sing songs of '90s that I don't really know that well. Me, I'm more like in, you know, 2011, 2012 songs.	4934_11.a	2013-01-03	F	4934	Angelique Kerber	Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova	So was it good or not so good?	4934_11.q	36.0	1	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL	International
4934_12	I actually started working with him in September when I just got into academy. We were in Asia to go, so it was easier to start preseason after working a bit in September.	4934_12.a	2013-01-03	F	4934	Angelique Kerber	Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova	So the coach Bremond, did you work with him before at Patrick's, or is this new for you?	4934_12.q	36.0	1	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL	International
4934_13	What do I expect tomorrow?	4934_13.a	2013-01-03	F	4934	Angelique Kerber	Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova	Look ahead to the semis. Probably not the opponent you expected tomorrow.	4934_13.q	36.0	1	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL	International
4934_14	Well, I'm ready to play any time. Definitely it's going to be tougher and tougher now, so I'm just ready to try to do my best again.	4934_14.a	2013-01-03	F	4934	Angelique Kerber	Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova	No. Probably not who you expect to play. How do you approach it?	4934_14.q	36.0	1	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL	International
76_0	Well, I felt it during one shot. I hit it against the wind and hit it late and I felt it in my wrist. I've had it before so I kind of know what it is. It's kind of painful every time I had to hit a backhand, so, yeah, I think it's I didn't want to do it worse before Melbourne as well, so I'm just going to try and get some treatment on it and try and get ready for next week.	76_0.a	2015-01-12	F	76	nan	Caroline Wozniacki	How is the wrist?	76_0.q	8.0	0	1st Round	APIA INTERNATIONAL SYDNEY	Premier
76_1	Yeah. I mean, it usually is. It's something that comes and goes a little bit. But with some treatment and ice and stuff like that, usually goes away.	76_1.a	2015-01-12	F	76	nan	Caroline Wozniacki	When you said it's something that's happened before, is it something you typically get over fairly quickly?	76_1.q	8.0	0	1st Round	APIA INTERNATIONAL SYDNEY	Premier
76_2	No, not at all. It was a new thing.	76_2.a	2015-01-12	F	76	nan	Caroline Wozniacki	Did it hurt last week at all?	76_2.q	8.0	0	1st Round	APIA INTERNATIONAL SYDNEY	Premier
76_3	Then it was just she taped it up and it didn't really make a difference taped or not taped. I just felt like it was getting a little worse, so I felt like I wasn't going to win the match without being able to hit like a proper backhand. I can only do it worse, and that's really too negative. I thought it was better to get treatment and see what's happening.	76_3.a	2015-01-12	F	76	nan	Caroline Wozniacki	(No microphone.)	76_3.q	8.0	0	1st Round	APIA INTERNATIONAL SYDNEY	Premier
76_4	Yeah, that's what I'm aiming for.	76_4.a	2015-01-12	F	76	nan	Caroline Wozniacki	Overall you should be okay for the next week? You're hoping that?	76_4.q	8.0	0	1st Round	APIA INTERNATIONAL SYDNEY	Premier
76_5	Most likely leave to Melbourne tomorrow.	76_5.a	2015-01-12	F	76	nan	Caroline Wozniacki	How long will you stay in Sydney? Will you go to Melbourne and get treatment there?	76_5.q	8.0	0	1st Round	APIA INTERNATIONAL SYDNEY	Premier
76_6	I still have a week to go, so hopefully it'll be fine. We'll see how it feels tomorrow. Hopefully it's going to feel better already tomorrow. I'm confident that I'll be fine to play in Melbourne.	76_6.a	2015-01-12	F	76	nan	Caroline Wozniacki	Are you concerned it may keep you out? A bit worried?	76_6.q	8.0	0	1st Round	APIA INTERNATIONAL SYDNEY	Premier
76_7	Yeah, definitely feel like I've had enough matches. I feel like I've had some good matches last week and made it to the finals. I feel like I've gotten enough match play.	76_7.a	2015-01-12	F	76	nan	Caroline Wozniacki	Regardless of the wrist, you feel like you've had enough matches?	76_7.q	8.0	0	1st Round	APIA INTERNATIONAL SYDNEY	Premier
76_8	What's my thoughts right now...	76_8.a	2015-01-12	F	76	nan	Caroline Wozniacki	Still with one week to go to Melbourne, what are your thoughts right now?	76_8.q	8.0	0	1st Round	APIA INTERNATIONAL SYDNEY	Premier
76_9	My thought is just that I need to get some treatment on it. Again, just take it day by day how it feels. Hopefully it'll take a couple days, a few days, and it'll be fine.	76_9.a	2015-01-12	F	76	nan	Caroline Wozniacki	About the wrist.	76_9.q	8.0	0	1st Round	APIA INTERNATIONAL SYDNEY	Premier
3346_0	Um, well, I'm obviously extremely excited right now. I felt like I did a couple things very well today; couple things I could have done better. But all in all, I played well in the big points. He had plenty of chances. There in the second set he could have knocked me out and got into a third, but I was able to hang tough and put myself in a position to where in the tiebreaker he missed a pretty simple forehand after we had a really long point, and that was all the mini break I needed. I was able to hold it out from there.	3346_0.a	2011-03-13	M	3346	nan	Ryan Harrison	General impressions of your progress at this stage?	3346_0.q	152.0	1	2nd Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
3346_1	Yes, I did. I went second round here last years, first round Miami. This is the furthest I have been.	3346_1.a	2011-03-13	M	3346	nan	Ryan Harrison	This is probably as far as you have been in a Masters Series. Can you talk about that?	3346_1.q	152.0	1	2nd Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
3346_2	Well, hopefully it's not stopping now. I want to keep going as long as I possibly can. I definitely have full belief in myself no matter who I play, so I'm going to take each match as it comes and try to do my best every time.	3346_2.a	2011-03-13	M	3346	nan	Ryan Harrison	Does it feel like a breakthrough?	3346_2.q	152.0	1	2nd Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
3346_3	I hit a slice serve out wide that they called out, and I challenged it. They said it was good. The challenge system said it was in. His racquet, the tip of the racquet, head of it, hit the outside of the ball and the ball just kept going by him, so he got a small, small piece of it. But for one, the call came after he made contact with the ball. And for two, there was absolutely no chance he could have gotten it back. She made us replay a point and play a let. I argued that the serve was unreturnable and that he had no chance. So I thought that was my point. But I guess come to find out, the rule is if he makes any racquet touch on the ball whatsoever, you play a let. I didn't know that.	3346_3.a	2011-03-13	M	3346	nan	Ryan Harrison	What was that discussion? I was there for the first set, and I left the second set and you had a discussion with the chair umpire?	3346_3.q	152.0	1	2nd Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
3346_4	I guess so. That's what I have been told. That's what she told me. I'm not sure if I should trust her or not. (Laughter.)	3346_4.a	2011-03-13	M	3346	nan	Ryan Harrison	That is the rule.	3346_4.q	152.0	1	2nd Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
3346_5	Exactly.	3346_5.a	2011-03-13	M	3346	nan	Ryan Harrison	So she knew that he couldn't hit it back either, but...	3346_5.q	152.0	1	2nd Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
3346_6	I mean, it was just a little bad luck. Obviously the challenge system has only been in play for two years, so personally I think that that should -- because usually the chair or, you know, if they've got sense, they can tell if the guy had a play on the ball if there was any chance he could have made it. I think it should be discretional. But the rule is right now from what she said that if he touches it, then we replay the point, even if he had a, you know, a really, really little piece of it. So I think if he was playing like a normal size racquet rather than a long racquet, there is no chance he would have touched. But that's all right.	3346_6.a	2011-03-13	M	3346	nan	Ryan Harrison	He had touched it?	3346_6.q	152.0	1	2nd Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
3346_7	Then I double faulted and then I hit two big serves.	3346_7.a	2011-03-13	M	3346	nan	Ryan Harrison	Then you double faulted.	3346_7.q	152.0	1	2nd Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
3346_8	I won a challenger in Hawaii about a month and a half ago. That was probably the only good result I've had. Actually I made finals of a challenger right after the Open. So this is the biggest event, the biggest event I have had since the Open at the tour level. Obviously, you know, I've only played I guess three tour event main draw matches since then. The first one was against Soderling, and he beat me 2 and 4; the second was Australian Open. I didn't play very good there. I got beat pretty bad by Mannarino. Wasn't a very good match. The last one was against Serra in Delray where I was really, really sick the entire time, throwing up on the court and trying to battle through it as much as I could. I ended up losing 5 in the third. But it was to the point where I was serving and volleying on both serves just because I literally couldn't hit three or four shots a point. I was getting that tired. For me, obviously I have had some chances. But, you know, I'm going to keep putting myself there in that position. I trust myself to come through. You just have to go through percentages. You put yourself in the right position, more often than not you're going to come through.	3346_8.a	2011-03-13	M	3346	nan	Ryan Harrison	Probably your best results since the Open. In the last few months or since then, what do you think you've learned and what do you think has improved in your game?	3346_8.q	152.0	1	2nd Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
3346_9	That was the biggest thing that I tried to do today differently than I have had in other matches at this level. When I got to big moments I just -- I picked something and I went with it. I didn't doubt myself, and I didn't look back on it and think it was a bad decision. If it didn't go the way I wanted to, I took a couple seconds to think about what I wanted to do. In my head, I was weighing the options of what I thought had the highest percentage chance of working, and I went with that. If it didn't work sometimes it was all right, but it worked more often than not.	3346_9.a	2011-03-13	M	3346	nan	Ryan Harrison	How clear a strategy do you have in the match? Because sometimes it's hard to figure out serve and volley on second serve, staying back.	3346_9.q	152.0	1	2nd Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
3346_10	I have always gone after my second serve. I guess it's safer, because my double faults are always lower than three or four a match, so...	3346_10.a	2011-03-13	M	3346	nan	Ryan Harrison	I haven't seen too many second serves 109, 112. Is that new? Is that always how you go about things? It's not very safe.	3346_10.q	152.0	1	2nd Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
3346_11	He's two years older. He's not a teenager anymore, so let's clarify that.	3346_11.a	2011-03-13	M	3346	nan	Ryan Harrison	You might play Raonic in the next round if he gets through Fish. You guys are similar in age.	3346_11.q	152.0	1	2nd Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
3346_12	He's playing great and he's been playing great tennis. I have watched him play. He's made a lot of improvements in his game, especially on the ground. I remember him from juniors. We played three times in juniors. I won twice; he won once. But at that time, I mean, we're talking juniors, so we're talking years ago. He's a big guy. He's finally reeled in his groundstrokes, and he's playing great tennis now. Whether it be him or Mardy, I do have full confidence in myself and I feel I can win. It would certainly be great to have the chance to play Raonic, and I would look forward to playing Mardy as well. Either way I'm pretty excited to be in the third round. No matter who I play, I'm going to approach it with the same mindset.	3346_12.a	2011-03-13	M	3346	nan	Ryan Harrison	What do you have to say about his game? He's obviously one of the biggest names on tour this year.	3346_12.q	152.0	1	2nd Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
3346_13	Well, um, I mean, that's tough, because obviously in theory you tell yourself not to think about it. You say you're not going to think about it, you're just going to worry about yourself. Anyone who says they don't see press about themselves and read about what people write -- I mean, obviously you're going to see it at some point. Clearly, I think it's -- I have said this plenty of times -- but pressure to me, it's not a pressure to have that on my shoulders. I look at it as first of all, it's an honor to be mentioned in the same name and sentence as the guys that I have been before. I really -- I'm doing everything I can to work hard and to put myself in the right positions to come through and make it there. I certainly believe in myself as much as anyone can believe in themselves. I have complete intentions of winning Grand Slams and being No.1 in the world and hopefully being a Davis Cup leader. I mean, that's what I want to do with my career. And, yeah, I mean, Andy has been great for the past ten years. James was up to 4 in the world. Mardy is now playing the best tennis. I think he's 28 or something like that, and he's at a career-high ranking right now. Sam has been pretty established in the top 20 in the world last three years, and John has been kind of sporadic in the top 20, but clearly with his game he's got the ability to beat anybody. I think that everyone kind of got spoiled whenever we had Agassi, Sampras, Chang, and Courier, all these guys in the same era that all won Grand Slams. With the way tennis is these days and the way technology is, you have little countries producing great athletes, so just obviously the depth is a little bit more, a little tougher, because the United States doesn't have just like an outstanding amount of players playing tennis compared to everybody else. Obviously Spain has a lot of players and so does France and some other countries. I can't name all of them right now.	3346_13.a	2011-03-13	M	3346	nan	Ryan Harrison	Do you think at all about being a leader, being part of the next wave of the next tennis stars? We watch Roddick who is 28, Blake's 31. They're not going to last forever. Do you talk about that with your coaches? Is there a plan here two years from now?	3346_13.q	152.0	1	2nd Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
5637_0	Yeah, look, I thought it was a very good match. Obviously I had an opportunity to close out that first set a little bit quicker than what I ended up doing. Look, I thought we both played very well. Ana came out swinging. I thought she returned great tonight. I think as that third set went on, she kind of, I don't know what she was feeling obviously, but I thought she was kind of up there. I felt like I had to hit very good serves and really hit my spots to make it that I was going to be on top of the point. Then the last couple of games where she broke me she, yeah, played unbelievable. I think we both played very well. Yeah, that's that.	5637_0.a	2014-01-17	F	5637	Ana Ivanovic	Samantha Stosur	What were your thoughts on the match overall?	5637_0.q	17.0	0	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5637_1	Look, I think her forehand is her better shot anyway. She's always very dangerous on that side, has the ability to hit a lot of winners. I kind of knew that going in anyway. I do think she hit it very well tonight. If you weren't going there with a purpose or hitting it well, then you were going to be in trouble for the rest of the point. It's one of these things you can't not go there, but you also have a make sure whatever you are doing to that side has got to be effective.	5637_1.a	2014-01-17	F	5637	Ana Ivanovic	Samantha Stosur	She was strong on her forehand tonight. Was it hard to avoid that?	5637_1.q	17.0	0	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5637_2	I think she still generally plays the same way. I think she's playing better now than maybe a year or two ago. I think confidence probably has a lot to do with that. Her serve was very good tonight. Sometimes that's something that can break down. But, look, I think she's obviously got a very dangerous game. She's got the ability to beat anyone. When she's on, she's very tough.	5637_2.a	2014-01-17	F	5637	Ana Ivanovic	Samantha Stosur	Has her game changed the last 12 months or so?	5637_2.q	17.0	0	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5637_3	Yeah, I don't know. Maybe that's tennis. I thought we were both playing very well, like I said. That first set obviously got pretty close there at the end. She had opportunities. Sometimes when you lose a set after having so many set points, it's easy to have a drop. But she certainly didn't do that tonight. I felt like even though I was down Love40 in that first service game of the second set, to get that back, I felt I was able to kick on and keep the momentum. But she was able to shut that down and get that early break. Yeah, I wasn't able to get it back. There were certainly chances where maybe I had a little sniff here and there towards the end of that second set. But she played well to get out of them.	5637_3.a	2014-01-17	F	5637	Ana Ivanovic	Samantha Stosur	Was there anything particularly you thought caused the match to start swinging her way?	5637_3.q	17.0	0	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5637_4	Look, I'd probably have to think about it a little bit more before I can really dissect point by point or really crucial things. But, look, it's easier maybe afterwards when you do sit down and look at it. When you're in the moment, I think you've got to go with what your gut says. That's what I did. I tried to back myself with those decisions that I made.	5637_4.a	2014-01-17	F	5637	Ana Ivanovic	Samantha Stosur	It's obviously easy to say it now, but are there things looking back you could have done differently to get her off balance on her forehand?	5637_4.q	17.0	0	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5637_5	Look, I do think I played well. She played probably that little bit better tonight. That's kind of the way it is. Look, of course it's disappointing. I thought, you know, I was playing well enough to get through the next round. Look, it's one of those things, tennis is tough. Sometimes there's obviously more important points than others. You win those, you go through. If you don't, you sit here on the other end of it. Look, it was a tough match. Obviously I've got to look at it in a little bit more time to see exactly what went wrong. At the moment now, it's disappointing, but I have to say that I'm proud of the way I was able to play out there.	5637_5.a	2014-01-17	F	5637	Ana Ivanovic	Samantha Stosur	Having been up a set and then to lose, do you walk away still thinking you played well and she played a really good game?	5637_5.q	17.0	0	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5637_6	Yeah, look, you never like losing no matter what circumstances. But if you're going to lose, for sure it's better when you don't feel like you beat yourself and you kind of did things that you know you shouldn't or whatever it is. So, again, yeah, disappointed, but can still look back on that match and think that I played well and got beaten by a good player tonight.	5637_6.a	2014-01-17	F	5637	Ana Ivanovic	Samantha Stosur	Did that make the loss a little bit easier to take?	5637_6.q	17.0	0	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5637_7	Sure. I'm pleased with the tournament. I guess it kind of all goes together just the same as that last answer. It's obviously disappointing I couldn't go further. But I thought I played well. I thought each match got better. There's certainly lots of positives I can take from this first few weeks of the year going into the rest of the year. So it is what it is. But I'm looking forward to obviously the weeks ahead.	5637_7.a	2014-01-17	F	5637	Ana Ivanovic	Samantha Stosur	Can you take some good positives out of the tournament?	5637_7.q	17.0	0	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5637_8	Yeah, look, I don't feel like any of the outside whatever was a problem. So I thought I handled myself well, played well, was able to get through some tricky moments in Hobart probably that led to me being able to feel more comfortable on court and play better here. No, for me this year, it was just another tournament and I enjoyed it, yeah, gave myself the best opportunity to try to play well.	5637_8.a	2014-01-17	F	5637	Ana Ivanovic	Samantha Stosur	You looked more comfortable on court than maybe you have been in the past few years. Do you feel you've turned a corner in terms of playing in this city?	5637_8.q	17.0	0	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5637_9	No, nothing really different to previous years. I think it's just one of those things. Each time you go through, you maybe get a little bit better at it. At the end of the day, if you're playing well, kind of everything else becomes irrelevant. It's how good you're hitting the ball and if you're winning matches really.	5637_9.a	2014-01-17	F	5637	Ana Ivanovic	Samantha Stosur	Have you done anything in particular before these tournaments to try to address these problems?	5637_9.q	17.0	0	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5637_10	Yeah, I think at nighttime the ball is always heavier anyway. It's probably sometimes not helping my game sometimes. With the roof shut, it probably slowed things even more, and she was able to keep swinging and really going through it. Her ball was able to penetrate the court, whereas obviously I like to play with spin, and I didn't feel like I was really getting the reward for doing all that. But, you know, it's one of those things. Got the ability to close the roof. You go out there and play. I didn't worry about it going back out there. Yeah, for sure it makes the conditions a bit heavier.	5637_10.a	2014-01-17	F	5637	Ana Ivanovic	Samantha Stosur	The roof closing, did that have any effect at all on your play on the ball?	5637_10.q	17.0	0	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5637_11	No, no. I felt good. Look, yeah, I was concentrating and focusing on trying to win that next point and get through whatever was going on out there. I just tried to think tactically, Okay, what am I going to do now? What did she just do? Try and win the next point. It was just a matter of playing tennis.	5637_11.a	2014-01-17	F	5637	Ana Ivanovic	Samantha Stosur	As experienced as you are, when the break came early in the third set, did you start to feel those old nerves again?	5637_11.q	17.0	0	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5637_12	Oh, I don't think it probably helped either of us. 87 in a tiebreak, it's not ideal for anyone. Yeah, bad timing maybe to walk off the court. I don't know.	5637_12.a	2014-01-17	F	5637	Ana Ivanovic	Samantha Stosur	Did you feel the delay because of the rain came at a good or bad time for you or didn't make any difference?	5637_12.q	17.0	0	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5637_13	Anytime you go on court, there's always a chance. I thought Ana played very well tonight. If she can keep serving well, be dangerous on her forehand, it will certainly give Serena something to think about. It's going to be very tough. Serena's obviously playing very well. She has been for a long time now. Ana probably doesn't have much to lose, so she can go out there and swing freely. I guess it will be a good match.	5637_13.a	2014-01-17	F	5637	Ana Ivanovic	Samantha Stosur	What chances do you think Ana has to pass Serena Williams?	5637_13.q	17.0	0	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5637_14	I don't know. I don't know if there's a rule that says once some raindrops fall on the court you should stop. Maybe whoever won or lost that point was not going to be happy about it. But, yeah, I don't know. I can't really comment.	5637_14.a	2014-01-17	F	5637	Ana Ivanovic	Samantha Stosur	The last point where the rain started falling really hard, do you think the last point should have been replayed?	5637_14.q	17.0	0	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5637_15	Of course I'd like to get back to the top 10. That's kind of what I'd like to do. But you don't get there without winning lots of matches and working hard. So you've got to put all those little things into place first. Probably this year I've got to try to do a bit better in these bigger tournaments, Grand Slams, where there's a lot more to gain. Hopefully I can peak at those right times this year.	5637_15.a	2014-01-17	F	5637	Ana Ivanovic	Samantha Stosur	In your head have you set yourself any goals, getting back in the top 10, anything like that?	5637_15.q	17.0	0	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5637_16	Absolutely. I think I'm more than capable of playing better and getting better and still improving, doing all that kind of stuff. I'm looking forward to it. Yeah, I've got no reason to think that I can't keep getting better. Hopefully that will show.	5637_16.a	2014-01-17	F	5637	Ana Ivanovic	Samantha Stosur	Do you still feel like the best times of your career are still in front of you?	5637_16.q	17.0	0	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5637_17	It will be pretty much fulltime. We need to discuss what's going to happen now, ahead, what tournaments, all that kind of stuff. Look, it is pretty much going to be a fulltime thing. So, yeah, I guess we've got to work it all out.	5637_17.a	2014-01-17	F	5637	Ana Ivanovic	Samantha Stosur	Is Miles staying with you or just before the slams?	5637_17.q	17.0	0	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
6055_0	Well, I'm happy with the result because I'm in the finals. That's one thing to be happy about. I don't feel that I played my best tennis today, but to be in the semifinals of a Grand Slam and winning a match where I felt my opponent played extremely well, exceptional tennis and I didn't feel that I was playing my best, I fought, I scrambled, and I found a way to win. I'm happy and proud about that.	6055_0.a	2014-06-05	F	6055	Eugenie Bouchard	Maria Sharapova	Second set, down a break, your serve was troubling you. How do you find the result? How do you work in those situations?	6055_0.q	8.0	1	Semifinals	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6055_1	Well, I would love to win those matches in two sets, but I always feel like I put in the work to be ready to play whatever it takes. If it takes three hours to win the match in three sets, I will be ready for that. If I have a match that's easier and a more convincing win, then I will take that, as well. But I will do whatever it takes. If I don't start good, if I lose the first set, I'm going to be there until the end.	6055_1.a	2014-06-05	F	6055	Eugenie Bouchard	Maria Sharapova	The last three matches you played here were all like thriller matches  high tensions, critical moments, comebacks. Can we say that in a way this was maybe even better to build yourself confidence maybe even more so than winning easier matches?	6055_1.q	8.0	1	Semifinals	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6055_2	Yeah, I think there were a few key moments in the match. I think getting that break back in the first was important, but then giving it right back to her was sloppy on my part and not what I had wanted to. I think I started to do things much better and returned better, being more aggressive, and then after I lost that game obviously she didn't feel the pressure anymore. So it was a very tight second set. I had my chances. Had some match points. I was happy that I was able to break her and win that set. It was a great game for me. And in the third I thought I was the aggressive one. I stepped up and I was doing things that I had wanted to do, which was I feel maybe I should have done earlier.	6055_2.a	2014-06-05	F	6055	Eugenie Bouchard	Maria Sharapova	What did you feel was the difference between the first set and the two sets that you won? Did you make any adjustments after the first set that you think made a difference?	6055_2.q	8.0	1	Semifinals	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6055_3	I'm not sure if that's something can you work on, but I think when you're forced to be in those situations when you're either not playing good or you find yourself in a losing position, I just don't want to give up, because I work too hard to just let something go and let a match go. You put so much effort, you and your team, to get to this position. If some things are not working out, I don't just want to quit in the middle. Because when you lose the first set or a few games or you're down a break, that's not the end of the match. That's the type of philosophy that I play with.	6055_3.a	2014-06-05	F	6055	Eugenie Bouchard	Maria Sharapova	You came through a lot today; you came through a lot the in past three matches; you have come through a lot in your career. Just talk about your toughness. Where do you think it comes from? Is that something you've worked on? Is that something you're really proud of? Could you talk about that?	6055_3.q	8.0	1	Semifinals	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6055_4	I think she's a bit more aggressive than maybe before. Her technique is a little different. I think she throws a lot of weight into her shots and creates a lot of power by doing that. You know, she's definitely improved since I played her here last year, but, you know, it's tough to evaluate right now after only being away from the court for an hour just battling it out and trying to find my rhythm and my game.	6055_4.a	2014-06-05	F	6055	Eugenie Bouchard	Maria Sharapova	You played her twice about this time last year. Obviously we all know she's a better player. In what ways did you sense she's an improved player now?	6055_4.q	8.0	1	Semifinals	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6055_5	I noticed that today.	6055_5.a	2014-06-05	F	6055	Eugenie Bouchard	Maria Sharapova	How do you know that she throws herself into her shots? Were you studying her or did you notice that today?	6055_5.q	8.0	1	Semifinals	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6055_6	Yeah, I had some trouble with my rhythm. Yeah, actually in some moments it let me down, but in some moments it backed me up. So, yeah, it will be definitely something I work on tomorrow and improve for the next match.	6055_6.a	2014-06-05	F	6055	Eugenie Bouchard	Maria Sharapova	You found your serve back in the third set. What happened at that point in the match? Was it just a timing issue?	6055_6.q	8.0	1	Semifinals	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6055_7	Well, I still have the hunger, even though I'm in a different generation. But, yeah, I think she's creating situations and putting herself in positions where she can go into a match like today and play freely and loosely and use this experience to her benefit. Because, you know, after a match like this, I mean, I don't feel that she has much to lose. You know, I know she's been in a semifinal before in Australia. She's been having a great year. But, you know, she's improved so much and everything is going on the way up right now. In a way, it's always tougher to play opponents like that because they play quite freely and they really go for their shots. They have nothing to lose, and you see that in their attitude and their game.	6055_7.a	2014-06-05	F	6055	Eugenie Bouchard	Maria Sharapova	Is it a different kind of intensity at all for you when you're playing a player who is a young player still trying to establish herself and maybe has a different sort of hunger than someone who is closer to your generation, especially in this sort of match where it could really transform her career to win it?	6055_7.q	8.0	1	Semifinals	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6055_8	I'm not a coach. You know, I'm not an advisor. I'm a tennis player. I'm sure she has a lot of people that can help her with that.	6055_8.a	2014-06-05	F	6055	Eugenie Bouchard	Maria Sharapova	What do you think the next step is for her to get closer on par?	6055_8.q	8.0	1	Semifinals	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6055_9	Yeah, definitely in these last matches I have lost the first set, but I have lost them in different ways. I feel that today, you know, once I got the break up I should have been the one that was playing more aggressive tennis and she should have been the one that was a bit more under pressure. I happened to play a sloppy game and she served it out well. That's the end of the set right there. Every situation is different. You know, at the end of the day, it's not how you finish a first set. It's how you finish the last set.	6055_9.a	2014-06-05	F	6055	Eugenie Bouchard	Maria Sharapova	You're a great fighter. I would like to know that if you think to be a slow starter is something you're not used to or that you're becoming this now, or if is just a coincidence? Or you think that you have tension because maybe you're thinking you're the favorite of the tournament? I don't know. There is any reason, in your opinion, that for three times in a row, more or less...	6055_9.q	8.0	1	Semifinals	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6055_10	I feel I have played a lot of tough matches in this clay season, and I think that's benefited and helped me because I have been pushed in different situations. I know in some matches I have started out really strong where I have been, you know, sloppy in the beginning and I have had to come back. Some have gone really deep in the third set. With that in mind and knowing that I've got through most of them and winning two titles gives me a lot of confidence. Energywise, that's what I have worked for, physically is to be in these types of situations where I can finish a match like this. I played three matches, two before this, and in the end of today's third set, I still feel like I can play another one. That's something I didn't have a few years ago, and I have improved. Obviously there is one more to go.	6055_10.a	2014-06-05	F	6055	Eugenie Bouchard	Maria Sharapova	You have used a lot of energy and probably adrenaline to get to this point, so I want to sort of check in to see where your energy is and how you're feeling physically. Where does this rank in terms of the Grand Slam finals you've reached in terms of difficulty?	6055_10.q	8.0	1	Semifinals	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6055_11	Well, I think after not playing for five or six months, when you start winning a couple of titles and you get to the finals of a Grand Slam, it's easy to forget that you were away from the game and that you're battling an injury. It's nice to sort of think back at that time and think where you came from and you got yourself back in this position. I'm very proud, because I worked hard to get myself injury free, and I had to work through some tough losses in the beginning of the season that I didn't want to accept. I worked through them, I worked hard, and I'm in this position giving myself a chance. As a tennis player, that's what I'm personally proud of more than anything.	6055_11.a	2014-06-05	F	6055	Eugenie Bouchard	Maria Sharapova	Where does this rank as far as the difficulty of getting to another Grand Slam final in terms of your career?	6055_11.q	8.0	1	Semifinals	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6055_12	Maybe (smiling). I'm wiser and, I don't know, maybe a better mover.	6055_12.a	2014-06-05	F	6055	Eugenie Bouchard	Maria Sharapova	Do you think your movement is actually improving with age?	6055_12.q	8.0	1	Semifinals	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6055_13	I don't know. Maybe. Does it look like it?	6055_13.a	2014-06-05	F	6055	Eugenie Bouchard	Maria Sharapova	Yeah?	6055_13.q	8.0	1	Semifinals	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6055_14	Thank you (Laughter).	6055_14.a	2014-06-05	F	6055	Eugenie Bouchard	Maria Sharapova	Yes.	6055_14.q	8.0	1	Semifinals	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
168_0	Yeah, no, he served well. I don't know what his percentage was, but it was only really one game he gave me a couple of second serves, you know, that game that I ended up having two break points. He hit two massive second serves on both those break points. Wasn't a lot I could do in his second service games to put him under pressure. Yeah, even when I made a couple good returned off his first serve he he still volleyed pretty well. I think normally he gives you a few more cheap points on his service games and then you can try and build pressure, but I can't remember him hitting a double fault tonight either. He served really well.	168_0.a	2015-01-06	M	168	Sam Groth	Lleyton Hewitt	Incredible watching some of those serves. What was it like facing him today?	168_0.q	84.0	0	1st Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL PRESENTED BY SUNCORP	ATP250
168_1	No. The first set, yeah, I just didn't play solid enough games those early games of each set. It was a lot heavier conditions out there tonight as well from what I been practicing in during the day. His power and strength he can still hit through the court, whereas I felt like the ball wasn't coming through for me quit as much to put him under more pressure. Yeah, but all credit to him. Even when he chipcharged or tried to come into the net, he didn't miss a lot of approach shots.	168_1.a	2015-01-06	M	168	Sam Groth	Lleyton Hewitt	Did you think he might go off the boil at some point?	168_1.q	84.0	0	1st Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL PRESENTED BY SUNCORP	ATP250
168_2	Yeah, not a lot. He was at the last Davis Cup tie. Did more doubles practice and stuff. Bit of a mixture. A lot more drills and stuff. And it was on grass. It was totally different. Yeah, I practiced with him years ago. I've hit with him a few times, but not heaps.	168_2.a	2015-01-06	M	168	Sam Groth	Lleyton Hewitt	Had you practiced with him at all?	168_2.q	84.0	0	1st Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL PRESENTED BY SUNCORP	ATP250
168_3	Yeah, he's a flashy player from the back of the court. You don't really know what you're going to get, and that's what makes it tougher. You go out there and you could play a guy like Marinko who hits the ball so clean from the back of the court you know every shot how it's going to come off. He's going to hit a lot of winners. Whereas Sam, a couple could hit the back fence and then the next five or six could be clean winners. So it's hard to go out there and get that rhythm, and that makes him more dangerous.	168_3.a	2015-01-06	M	168	Sam Groth	Lleyton Hewitt	You touched on his serve and net game. Were you surprised at how well he played from the back of the court tonight?	168_3.q	84.0	0	1st Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL PRESENTED BY SUNCORP	ATP250
168_4	No, no, I'm playing two exhibition matches next week anyway. No, I'm happy with those matches. I would have liked to have got more matches this week obviously, but I'm still  Guccione and I are in the doubles here as well. For me, I was really happy wit how I played in the doubles last night. All my practice sets have been first class, so, yeah, I've got to still try and ay as positive as can be. Then again, I won here last year and then lost first round in the Open, so be nice if I go and do a bit better in the Open and lose first round here.	168_4.a	2015-01-06	M	168	Sam Groth	Lleyton Hewitt	Change anything for you in your plans going to Melbourne? Play Sydney?	168_4.q	84.0	0	1st Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL PRESENTED BY SUNCORP	ATP250
168_5	Mostly it was all about him. Yeah, higher percentage of first serves obviously. But with that said, you know, unless I broke him that game, I didn't have a look in, so I would've only got to tiebreakers anyway. There is not a whole heap I could have done apart from hold the few couple of service games early in each set. Yeah, you just don't know. Possibly if I was able to hold early and then build some pressure, then I might've got a couple double faults or a couple of cheap errors. Wasn't meant to be.	168_5.a	2015-01-06	M	168	Sam Groth	Lleyton Hewitt	Is there anything you would do differently, or did you feel it was just more about him tonight?	168_5.q	84.0	0	1st Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL PRESENTED BY SUNCORP	ATP250
168_6	Yeah, now they're playing really well at the moment obviously. It's been good, because obviously Nick has taken a lot of the spotlight. And now Thanasi, we've all known was going to break through at some stage. That was a really good win for him yesterday. And Ducks, I like him. He's a hard worker, and I'm really glad  to beat a guy like Simon, that's a quality win. Johnny Millman, he's a battler. He's nearly given up a couple times, so that's great for him to get an opportunity against Rog. Think that's about it at the moment. It's good. Obviously Sam is a unique one because he's a later developer, but he also had his time away from the game through injury as well.	168_6.a	2015-01-06	M	168	Sam Groth	Lleyton Hewitt	How do you see the guys that are in the up and coming group?	168_6.q	84.0	0	1st Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL PRESENTED BY SUNCORP	ATP250
168_7	Yeah, he and I had a great hit the other day. Hit for a couple hours and both hit the ball really well. Yeah, I watched most of his match last night. Thought he played really well. Yeah, he was a little bit tentative at the start, which Querrey stepped up and played well. But then from, yeah, 53, 54 in the first set he played great for the next set and a half. Yeah, Bernie has been serving a lot better I think since he came back from his hip surgeries, which helps his game a lot. He is getting a lot of cheap points because he reads the play so well. On return of serve he makes a lot of balls, so he puts you under pressure that way. If he's able to hold serve, then he's tough.	168_7.a	2015-01-06	M	168	Sam Groth	Lleyton Hewitt	Just on that, Tomic has been talking about his newfound maturity and focus. You hit with him before this kicked off. Any insight site into what you've seen?	168_7.q	84.0	0	1st Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL PRESENTED BY SUNCORP	ATP250
168_8	Yeah.	168_8.a	2015-01-06	M	168	Sam Groth	Lleyton Hewitt	Just with Roger, you have your relationship off court. Seem to do a lot of stuff together.	168_8.q	84.0	0	1st Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL PRESENTED BY SUNCORP	ATP250
168_9	Yeah, we get along great. Obviously we used to be rivals for a long time. Yeah, I think we have a mutual respect for each other. We grew up in juniors together. It's great what he does for the game obviously. I'm thrilled to be able to play him in Sydney next week. Just to have him in another major city in Australia, it's good for Australian tennis.	168_9.a	2015-01-06	M	168	Sam Groth	Lleyton Hewitt	How is that?	168_9.q	84.0	0	1st Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL PRESENTED BY SUNCORP	ATP250
168_10	It's really good. Paul is a great guy. Met with him a few times last year. Yeah, he's a good consultant to have for Pat to bounce ideas off of, and a lot of people in Tennis Australia you know, he's obviously been in the systems in the USTA and the LTA. He's worked with some of the best players going around. He's good.	168_10.a	2015-01-06	M	168	Sam Groth	Lleyton Hewitt	Paul Annacone has come onboard with Tennis Australia. Just your thoughts on that.	168_10.q	84.0	0	1st Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL PRESENTED BY SUNCORP	ATP250
1268_0	Uhm, routine?  I don't know.  I think it was definitely a match to be serious for.  She's a good player.	1268_0.a	2008-01-18	F	1268	Victoria Azarenka	Serena Williams	What are your thoughts on that match?  Pretty routine?	1268_0.q	7.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1268_1	Yeah, I definitely served well today.  It was much better than what I did my other two rounds, so it's looking good.  I like it.	1268_1.a	2008-01-18	F	1268	Victoria Azarenka	Serena Williams	Served unbelievably well.  Can you serve much better than that?	1268_1.q	7.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1268_2	I got some treatment in the locker room earlier on my shoulder.  I kind of credit it to that (smiling).	1268_2.a	2008-01-18	F	1268	Victoria Azarenka	Serena Williams	Can you bottle that, figure out why it happened?	1268_2.q	7.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1268_3	Yeah, I think she played really well off the ground, and she moved well, which is always good to be able to hit hard and move well.  I thought she had a lot of pace on her balls, too.	1268_3.a	2008-01-18	F	1268	Victoria Azarenka	Serena Williams	She's an up-and-coming player.  Seemed to play pretty well off the ground.	1268_3.q	7.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1268_4	Yeah, I'm moving well.  I'm not even moving my fastest.  You know, I can move faster when I want to.	1268_4.a	2008-01-18	F	1268	Victoria Azarenka	Serena Williams	Are you happy with the way you're moving at this point in the tournament?	1268_4.q	7.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1268_5	Yeah, I love playing doubles with V.  It's like playing with a guy because she has a great serve.  She hits these hard balls.  I just stand and look like an All-American.  It's pretty cool.	1268_5.a	2008-01-18	F	1268	Victoria Azarenka	Serena Williams	Venus is playing doubles with you.  It's like playing with herself.  Is that the same for you?	1268_5.q	7.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1268_6	You know, we kind of just do our own thing.  And like sometimes I'll tell her like to look for this and stuff, look for that. I don't know who really takes the lead.  I don't know.	1268_6.a	2008-01-18	F	1268	Victoria Azarenka	Serena Williams	Who decides tactics?	1268_6.q	7.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1268_7	Well, I mean, we are a renowned doubles team ourselves (laughter), so I think the other teams out there know that.  So now we consider ourselves the No.2 seeds.  We're taking it just as serious as we are the singles.  We really enjoy the competition.  We enjoy playing doubles.	1268_7.a	2008-01-18	F	1268	Victoria Azarenka	Serena Williams	What does it say to the teams that are out there that you knocked off the No.2 seed?	1268_7.q	7.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1268_8	No, we started to play last year.  I wanted to play here last year as well.  I mean, obviously we want to play Olympics, doubles at the Olympics.  We would love to play doubles at the Olympics, and that's definitely something we want to keep in our hearts and in our minds.  But we also do enjoy playing doubles.	1268_8.a	2008-01-18	F	1268	Victoria Azarenka	Serena Williams	So it's not a coincidence you're playing doubles again in an Olympic year?	1268_8.q	7.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1268_9	By far, it is my most cherished trophy or anything, is definitely the gold medal.	1268_9.a	2008-01-18	F	1268	Victoria Azarenka	Serena Williams	Was that one of the most exciting titles you won, that Olympic gold?	1268_9.q	7.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1268_10	Yeah, if you can fit a tennis ball through them or your hand, like so (putting her hand through the earrings).  They serve as earrings and then I can wear them as bangles.  Two purposes.	1268_10.a	2008-01-18	F	1268	Victoria Azarenka	Serena Williams	Your earrings, are they officially large when you can fit a tennis ball through them?	1268_10.q	7.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1268_11	It's not done.  They're still working on it.  It's cool.  It's really exciting.	1268_11.a	2008-01-18	F	1268	Victoria Azarenka	Serena Williams	Are you still working on the Althea Gibson documentary?	1268_11.q	7.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1268_12	Yeah, you know what, I actually think they both play a like.  Obviously Vaidisova has had more -- has played more maybe in her career and done a little better, but I think they both have similar games.  Vaidisova has a really big serve.  She uses that to her advantage.	1268_12.a	2008-01-18	F	1268	Victoria Azarenka	Serena Williams	How would you compare Vaidisova to Azarenka?  Many nuances between them?	1268_12.q	7.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
2484_0	Yeah. Not the heaviest, though. The trophy in Serbia, I couldn't lift it over my head.	2484_0.a	2010-06-13	M	2484	Mardy Fish	Sam Querrey	Is that the biggest trophy you've ever won?	2484_0.q	23.0	1	The Final	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
2484_1	Very tough. You know, I think the finals are always tough. It's pretty rare you'll see both guys play at their best in the final of any sport. The conditions were pretty tough out there, the windiest day of the week so far. I just tried to stay level-headed and keep my composure, and fortunately I got through it.	2484_1.a	2010-06-13	M	2484	Mardy Fish	Sam Querrey	Tough match, wasn't it?	2484_1.q	23.0	1	The Final	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
2484_2	It's my soccer team. (Laughter.)	2484_2.a	2010-06-13	M	2484	Mardy Fish	Sam Querrey	You've won three titles on three different surfaces. Your football team did pretty well last night.	2484_2.q	23.0	1	The Final	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
2484_3	I mean, I hope so. You know, I'm gonna do the best I can at Wimbledon. I know Mardy is, Andy is, Isner is. Hopefully we can all make a run. Maybe that's a good omen that the final is on the 4th of July. Hopefully our football team can make a run at the World Cup.	2484_3.a	2010-06-13	M	2484	Mardy Fish	Sam Querrey	Wimbledon finals on the 4th of July this year. Do you think it could be America's year?	2484_3.q	23.0	1	The Final	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
2484_4	I watched the game last night, yeah.	2484_4.a	2010-06-13	M	2484	Mardy Fish	Sam Querrey	You watched it last night?	2484_4.q	23.0	1	The Final	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
2484_5	No, but I watched it with my family and some friends that were over.	2484_5.a	2010-06-13	M	2484	Mardy Fish	Sam Querrey	Did you watch it with Mardy?	2484_5.q	23.0	1	The Final	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
2484_6	Did I prepare with him? What do you mean?	2484_6.a	2010-06-13	M	2484	Mardy Fish	Sam Querrey	Did you prepare for the match today with Mardy?	2484_6.q	23.0	1	The Final	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
2484_7	No. We have the same coach, but Mardy hit with him, and then I went on the court right afterwards and hit with him. We joked around before the match.	2484_7.a	2010-06-13	M	2484	Mardy Fish	Sam Querrey	Warming up.	2484_7.q	23.0	1	The Final	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
2484_8	I didn't set a, like a round, quarters, or semis or anything like that. I just wanted to go out there and play with a good attitude and play level-headed and work on hitting my forehand inside out more than inside in, which I did a great job of all week. I just really wanted to focus on my service games the whole week, which I did a great job of. I think I only lost serve maybe like three times this week. I was more worried about my attitude and the way I played rather than how far I got in the tournament.	2484_8.a	2010-06-13	M	2484	Mardy Fish	Sam Querrey	Start of the week looking ahead, very strong field here. Realistically what was your goal? How far did you see yourself going here?	2484_8.q	23.0	1	The Final	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
2484_9	Definitely. You know, I'm playing great on the grass, and now I've got a week to practice and regroup. Then I'm looking forward to Wimbledon next Monday.	2484_9.a	2010-06-13	M	2484	Mardy Fish	Sam Querrey	A win like this must give you a lot of confidence giving to Wimbledon?	2484_9.q	23.0	1	The Final	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
2484_10	I mean, I'd love to win Wimbledon. I'm kind of going with baby steps here and try and make the third round this year, because the second round is the best I've ever done there. You know, it's possible, but I think I've still got some work to do, and there's still some great competitors out there you have to beat to win a Wimbledon title.	2484_10.a	2010-06-13	M	2484	Mardy Fish	Sam Querrey	Is Wimbledon sort of forming as a possibility in your mind? Do you see yourself as a future Wimbledon champion now?	2484_10.q	23.0	1	The Final	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
2484_11	Not really. I mean, he's still Roger Federer. He's lost early -- he's lost matches before and come back the next week and gone on to win events plenty of times in his career. I think guys are still gonna fear him. He's still the most feared player at Wimbledon even though he lost today to Lleyton. Maybe he's lost a little bit of his game, but he's still -- he's still, you know, the greatest player ever and the defending Wimbledon champion and the guy that -- you know, I definitely am gonna fear him more than any player.	2484_11.a	2010-06-13	M	2484	Mardy Fish	Sam Querrey	What do players think of Federer losing today in Germany? Does that perhaps give you hope or do you think that's maybe just a blip?	2484_11.q	23.0	1	The Final	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
2484_12	I think my return of serve can get much better, because my service games -- I hold serve most of the time. I think I lost serve, like I said, three or four times this week, so that allows me on the return games to take more chances. I think I need to start doing that, especially on the second serves. I think I could step up in the court in front of the baseline, take some swings at the ball. Even if you fly it 10 feet long, it's still -- you still let the opponent know, hey, I'm gonna take some cuts out there. You know, I think it will -- it will intimidate the opponent a little bit.	2484_12.a	2010-06-13	M	2484	Mardy Fish	Sam Querrey	If there is one area of your game that you think you can improve on, what would it be, do you think?	2484_12.q	23.0	1	The Final	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
2484_13	That's a good question. I mean, I don't really know. I'd like to go out there, and, you know, just have a positive attitude when I go out there and give 100% every time I step on the court, whether it's practice or a tournament and give it your all, and then whatever happens happens, you know. That way if you go out there and do that, you'll play with no regrets. Whether you finish 1 in the world with 25 Grand Slams or you finish -- you know, or your career high ranking is 20 in the world and you've won a couple 250s, you just know you've left it all out there and you have no regrets and you can't be disappointed.	2484_13.a	2010-06-13	M	2484	Mardy Fish	Sam Querrey	What's your ultimate ambition in sports? What are you capable of by the end of your career?	2484_13.q	23.0	1	The Final	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
2484_14	It's an honor. All the greatest players in the world are on this trophy. It's nice to be added to that list with them.	2484_14.a	2010-06-13	M	2484	Mardy Fish	Sam Querrey	There are some very famous names on that trophy: Sampras, McEnroe. How does it feel your name is going to be up there?	2484_14.q	23.0	1	The Final	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
2484_15	I mean, probably the US Open would be my first choice and then Wimbledon. A very, very tight second, though. (Laughter.)	2484_15.a	2010-06-13	M	2484	Mardy Fish	Sam Querrey	If you could win one Grand Slam, which one would it be?	2484_15.q	23.0	1	The Final	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
2484_16	I mean, it's one of the four most important tournaments in the world. You know, the Wimbledon trophy has these same names on it, and all the greats have won Wimbledon. It would be -- you know, it's an honor just to step on the grounds of Wimbledon. I remember the first time I was there. I was just in awe for the first week basically, and it's exciting to go out there. Last year I played my first match on Centre Court, which is exciting, and hopefully there will be many more Centre Court matches to come.	2484_16.a	2010-06-13	M	2484	Mardy Fish	Sam Querrey	What's Wimbledon mean to you?	2484_16.q	23.0	1	The Final	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
846_0	I think -- I disagree.  I mean, I felt the crowd was -- it was extremely fun walking out to Born in the USA and having the crowd chanting U-S-A. Night matches, you know, in this area are pretty electric, in my opinion, and that's probably the most -- in my opinion, that's the most electric match I've played all year. You know, and you don't play too many night matches where you're -- if you're from the U.S. where you're the big underdog and everybody's cheering for the other guy.  I didn't really feel like that was overwhelmingly the case, but it was pretty apparent who the crowd was cheering for which made it fun for me.	846_0.a	2007-08-25	M	846	James Blake	Mardy Fish	I know the other night you said it would be a lot of fun playing James, but it seemed a little strange out there, at least to me watching it.  There wasn't a lot of electricity.  Was it nerves playing him or something?	846_0.q	50.0	0	The Final	PILOT PEN TENNIS PRESENTED BY SCHICK	International Gold
846_1	Yeah, I think that was probably the key.  It would have been nice to, you know, hold serve.  I've played five matches this week in five days, and it's not that I can't do it, but I'm just not used to it right now not having played nearly as many matches. Off the top of my head I've probably played four matches all summer and then five or six here.  If your arm's not used that kind of stuff it's going to eventually break down.  That's something that, you know, the more and more matches you play the more you get used to serving and, you know, you go to Cincinnati and they're different balls and you come here and they're Wilson balls and the balls change and it's, you know, it's not easy on your arm to keep changing like that. So it would have been nice to hold serve, you know, like I normally do and, you know, but James puts a lot pressure on serving and he returns so well.  So he's one of those guys that I kind of know that you're going to get your chances on your return games, but, you know, you're going to have your work cut out for you on your serve game.	846_1.a	2007-08-25	M	846	James Blake	Mardy Fish	You never found the rhythm on your serve.  Talk about that.	846_1.q	50.0	0	The Final	PILOT PEN TENNIS PRESENTED BY SCHICK	International Gold
846_2	You're out-thinking yourself because they -- you think they know what you're going to do and so you know that they think you know what they're going to do and you kind of out-think yourself a little bit. You know, James played very solid tonight and, you know, gave me a little bit of a chance there in that second set to get back on serve but served his breakpoint away there at 4-3.	846_2.a	2007-08-25	M	846	James Blake	Mardy Fish	When you know someone so well are you making more errors because you're thinking you have to put the ball right in the same spot?	846_2.q	50.0	0	The Final	PILOT PEN TENNIS PRESENTED BY SCHICK	International Gold
846_3	I'm sure he could have lived with it.  Yes.  I would have lived with it had it been me.	846_3.a	2007-08-25	M	846	James Blake	Mardy Fish	Do you think there are enough years for James to have every lived with beating you on a challenge, if he gets that challenge at the very end and wins a match?	846_3.q	50.0	0	The Final	PILOT PEN TENNIS PRESENTED BY SCHICK	International Gold
846_4	It's been a great week.  It's been a great week.  You know, I wasn't even slated to come here.  Had I won maybe one or two matches in Cincinnati I probably would not have come here. I'm glad I did and, you, know it's funny, you lose and you get down on yourself, and then you lose a few in matches in a row this summer and, you know, you just kind of hope that instead of, you know, going second round, second round, second round I'd rather go first round, first round first round, final. I mean, it let's you know that you can do it and you can play well and you can beat top players and you can go deep in big tournaments. You know, this is great preparation for the US Open.  But on the other hand, it was a big tournament for me confidence-wise, like you said, because if I went into the US Open like I went into Wimbledon, you know, I would have struggled probably. I feel great right you now.  The body feels great and I think the arm, you know, from the serve is just from over-serving, and a couple days' rest and a little bit of treatment will take that away.	846_4.a	2007-08-25	M	846	James Blake	Mardy Fish	Can you just talk about the week in general.  I mean, what it means for you confidence-wise, emotionally, all that.	846_4.q	50.0	0	The Final	PILOT PEN TENNIS PRESENTED BY SCHICK	International Gold
846_5	You mean the past three weeks?	846_5.a	2007-08-25	M	846	James Blake	Mardy Fish	There's been two all-American finals in the last three weeks and four in the last four years.  Is there any reason?  Is it just a coincidence?	846_5.q	50.0	0	The Final	PILOT PEN TENNIS PRESENTED BY SCHICK	International Gold
846_6	I mean, the depth of men's tennis is so deep now, and, you know, you got guys from everywhere, you know, that are so good and so young.  They're 18, 19.  Djokovic is what, 19 years old and 3 in the world.  These guys are just coming from no where and shooting up the ranks, and they're all so good and everybody in the top 60, 70 in the world can beat anybody. You know so, it's -- the depth has gotten a lot tougher and we don't have right now -- we're trying our very best, but this isn't an era of Sampras and Agassi.  I could go on and on about every one of those guys, and it's a pretty tough era to follow.  It almost seems like you can't really do much to please everybody. We've got No.5 and No.6 in the world.  James is playing great and Andy, and the Bryan brothers are far and away the best team in doubles in the world.  I think we're doing okay.	846_6.a	2007-08-25	M	846	James Blake	Mardy Fish	Yeah, Washington and here.	846_6.q	50.0	0	The Final	PILOT PEN TENNIS PRESENTED BY SCHICK	International Gold
846_7	No, we don't feel like that.  As a mentality we always feel like we can beat anyone.  And, you know, like Davis Cup in the past couple years I was on the team in 2004 when we made the final and we lost in Spain 3-2 in the final.  That was kind of Nadal's coming out party and beat Andy in a really close match.  That doesn't happen and we win.  And so I feel like, no, we don't really feel like under dogs.	846_7.a	2007-08-25	M	846	James Blake	Mardy Fish	Did the U.S. have to learn to be an underdog, as a mentality?	846_7.q	50.0	0	The Final	PILOT PEN TENNIS PRESENTED BY SCHICK	International Gold
846_8	It was comparable to how we felt.  The atmosphere was obviously different.  Much more fun, in my opinion.  That was pretty stressful playing -- that was another situation that I had never been in, though. This was my ninth final so I'm pretty accustomed to playing big matches, and especially finals.  You know, that was a strange match and one of those matches where maybe you'd like to forget almost playing down there, and the score line I don't even think indicated how badly we both felt kind of out there. You know, it was an uncomfortable.  Felt a little bit uncomfortable and we didn't know whether to fist pump or to, you know, get down on ourselves or whatever.  And so this one was a little more fun and it was nice to be -- it was nice that it was here.  It's such a great event and in the States.	846_8.a	2007-08-25	M	846	James Blake	Mardy Fish	Can you compare the emotion of this match to when you played Roddick in Australia and what you felt like out there emotionally?	846_8.q	50.0	0	The Final	PILOT PEN TENNIS PRESENTED BY SCHICK	International Gold
846_9	Yeah.  We talked on the phone.  He gets to buy me dinner now.  We talked on the phone earlier today and yesterday after -- you know, before his match yesterday and, you know, we spent probably the last hour together.  I mean, we're just so used to -- if we both play at 7:00 on different courts we're in the lunch eating food or whatever, watching TV with each other anyway. Got my trainer and my coach at his table eating and, you know, my parents at my table.  So it's just what we're used to.	846_9.a	2007-08-25	M	846	James Blake	Mardy Fish	Did you and James talk to each other before the match at any time?	846_9.q	50.0	0	The Final	PILOT PEN TENNIS PRESENTED BY SCHICK	International Gold
846_10	No.  It felt really good.  It was really cool to walk out, you know, kind of the atmosphere and, you know, you didn't really know -- didn't exactly know how everyone would react or how many people would be here, and it was a great turn out and definitely special to be able to play James in a big match and to, you know --  to be able to play in a big match, you know, it's been a while.  Since Australia really that I played a big match like that.	846_10.a	2007-08-25	M	846	James Blake	Mardy Fish	Was it strange walking out on the court right before the match?	846_10.q	50.0	0	The Final	PILOT PEN TENNIS PRESENTED BY SCHICK	International Gold
846_11	Probably not tonight but tomorrow night.  Not probably.  Yes.	846_11.a	2007-08-25	M	846	James Blake	Mardy Fish	Going to stick him with a big check tonight?	846_11.q	50.0	0	The Final	PILOT PEN TENNIS PRESENTED BY SCHICK	International Gold
846_12	To be honest, I hadn't won two matches in a row in a while, and probably since probably Memphis was the last time and that's a long time, man. Especially after, you know, starting the year so well and having that huge lull.  The only thing I can say is I don't have to defend anything from February until late August.	846_12.a	2007-08-25	M	846	James Blake	Mardy Fish	You won here before.  What was your best case scenario of this week?	846_12.q	50.0	0	The Final	PILOT PEN TENNIS PRESENTED BY SCHICK	International Gold
846_13	I mean, I had match point down in the first round in the second set, and I was far from winning that match.  Had 30 -- 40-30 on his serve and just kind of went for a backhand up the line and it was either going to be a winner or I was going home, and lucky for me it went in. From there, I played better, and then the next round I played a little bit better and a little bit better and just got better and better and better every round.  It doesn't hurt your confidence when you play two good players in the second round and third round when you win ten games in a row to, you know, to finish off both matches. That helps a lot as well for confidence.	846_13.a	2007-08-25	M	846	James Blake	Mardy Fish	Were one of those matches the key, one of the earlier round matches really got the confidence soaring?	846_13.q	50.0	0	The Final	PILOT PEN TENNIS PRESENTED BY SCHICK	International Gold
846_14	He's too nice to shove it in my face for sure.  Definitely too nice for that.	846_14.a	2007-08-25	M	846	James Blake	Mardy Fish	Is Blake ever going let you forget this match?	846_14.q	50.0	0	The Final	PILOT PEN TENNIS PRESENTED BY SCHICK	International Gold
846_15	Well, I've been the third-ranked American basically my entire career.  If tennis fans or reporters are talking about American tennis and if they're only talking about two players being from such a big country, then I can't really help that. I'm doing my best to -- I'm doing everything I can to, you know try to, not necessarily satisfy people, but to try to, you know, make a name for myself and try to win as many matches as I can and get as ranked as high as I can and try to make as much money as I can while I can. It's a job, and that's what it come down do.  We are trying to make a living out here as well, and we always understand that we're playing a game.  It's a great job, but it is a job.  We're trying our best.	846_15.a	2007-08-25	M	846	James Blake	Mardy Fish	If you don't feel this way now, what do you think you need to achieve and what do round you think you need to get to in the next couple tournaments to be included in the American box of tennis like you said you were okay with?	846_15.q	50.0	0	The Final	PILOT PEN TENNIS PRESENTED BY SCHICK	International Gold
12_0	Yeah, it went all downhill from there. I don't know. I started playing really well. I was relaxed and free and played a couple of stupid points on my service game. That's when I really needed to put the foot down at 2Love, and, yeah, he started growing confidence and I started to get negative and started to get tighter with my shots and didn't feel like I was swinging freely at all. Yeah, played pretty average from 2Love.	12_0.a	2015-06-17	M	12	Gilles Simon	Thanasi Kokkinakis	You started that match on fire. What went wrong?	12_0.q	70.0	0	2nd Round	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP500
12_1	Yeah, I was pretty tired when I woke up, a bit sore on my glutes and stuff, but I think that's just grass in general. Yeah, I was a little bit fatigued but my ball striking wasn't great, either. I'm not going to use that too much as an excuse.	12_1.a	2015-06-17	M	12	Gilles Simon	Thanasi Kokkinakis	How did you feel physically? Is the fatigue starting to catch up with you a bit?	12_1.q	70.0	0	2nd Round	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP500
12_2	Yeah, I liked it yesterday. Didn't like it so much today (smiling). Yeah, I felt good on it yesterday. Movement is the hardest part about it. Obviously different to clay. Comes through a lot quicker, so I've got to get prepared earlier, which is what I didn't do today. But, yeah, hopefully another week and a half before Wimbledon and I'll be ready to...	12_2.a	2015-06-17	M	12	Gilles Simon	Thanasi Kokkinakis	How are you finding the grass?	12_2.q	70.0	0	2nd Round	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP500
12_3	I will play the Boodles event.	12_3.a	2015-06-17	M	12	Gilles Simon	Thanasi Kokkinakis	Where will you be playing next week?	12_3.q	70.0	0	2nd Round	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP500
12_4	Yeah, that was definitely a good chance for me. Even though I wasn't playing great, I still found that I was having a lot of ins on his serve, a lot of 30Alls, and I had that break point there, and I missed a forehand. My forehand wasn't on the whole match apart from the first two games. Then, yeah, again, I had a game point in the next game where he broke me and I had a set forehand again and I just dumped it. Yeah, I just wasn't feeling confident with my shots for some reason today. I felt bad for everyone watching, really. It was a bit disappointing.	12_4.a	2015-06-17	M	12	Gilles Simon	Thanasi Kokkinakis	Was the fourth game in the second set really the clutcher when you had the break point, a really long game, held, and he broke you in the next game?	12_4.q	70.0	0	2nd Round	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP500
12_5	Yes, exactly. I felt like I had to say something. I felt like it was one of my poorest performances in a while.	12_5.a	2015-06-17	M	12	Gilles Simon	Thanasi Kokkinakis	Hence the tweet?	12_5.q	70.0	0	2nd Round	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP500
12_6	Different from court 9 to centre court? Yeah, I don't know. It felt a little bit quicker, obviously more people watching. I was trying to impress them. Backfired on me. I don't know. Yeah, it's a bit different. It's a nice court to play on, though. But it's not too different. Same grass.	12_6.a	2015-06-17	M	12	Gilles Simon	Thanasi Kokkinakis	Playing on centre court versus court 1, do you feel any different?	12_6.q	70.0	0	2nd Round	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP500
12_7	Yeah, it's big for me. I definitely don't want to play quallies the rest of my life. It's something I had to do and I'm happy I did it that way rather than playing all the challengers. Got used to the level, and that's how my coaching staff and team wanted me to do it. Glad I showed up to tough out a lot of quallies, and now I'm hopefully ready to make runs into the main draws.	12_7.a	2015-06-17	M	12	Gilles Simon	Thanasi Kokkinakis	How big a difference would it be for you now going straight into the Grand Slams?	12_7.q	70.0	0	2nd Round	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP500
12_8	I doubt I will go back again. She's still going for now. Yeah, we'll see. She's struggling, though. But, yeah, I came back to see her. Once I was home, there was not really anything else I could do. It's a bit of a waiting game, really, which is disappointing. You feel like you can't really do anything. That's what it is. She'd prefer me to go out and play and do what I do. Happy I got the win for her yesterday but today wasn't to be.	12_8.a	2015-06-17	M	12	Gilles Simon	Thanasi Kokkinakis	How is your grandmother? Will her health have any bearing on your playing?	12_8.q	70.0	0	2nd Round	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP500
12_9	I think the movement is a big part. That was the biggest difference for me. I don't know if it was here but it felt a bit slippery. I think a few people are slipping over. But that's just grass in general, and I've got to work out my footing a little bit better. That's going to be a big thing. If you can move well on grass, it helps a lot. Again, playing well, getting the first big shot in so I can dictate the points, I think that's going to be important going forward. Yeah, you don't want to play too many defensive rallies on grass.	12_9.a	2015-06-17	M	12	Gilles Simon	Thanasi Kokkinakis	Between now and the start of The Championships, what do you feel you have to work on the most? Obviously you said your forehand let you down today, but overall, as you prepare, what's going to be the focus?	12_9.q	70.0	0	2nd Round	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP500
12_10	Yeah.	12_10.a	2015-06-17	M	12	Gilles Simon	Thanasi Kokkinakis	You're still in doubles, yes?	12_10.q	70.0	0	2nd Round	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP500
12_11	I mean, a chance to kind of redeem myself hopefully after the match I played today. I'm going to look forward to it, go out there with a positive mindset. Work on everything that helps my serve, return, my volleys. Probably doubles helps your game on grass more than anything. So, yeah, it's a tough match but I'm looking forward to getting out there with Rusty.	12_11.a	2015-06-17	M	12	Gilles Simon	Thanasi Kokkinakis	How does that help you?	12_11.q	70.0	0	2nd Round	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP500
12_12	Yeah, I don't think it was my serve. I think it was everything behind it. Because I wasn't feeling comfortable on my ground strokes, then I tried to go for more on my serve and I started double faulting a little bit. Yeah, it wasn't the serve that was the issue, even though it looks like that by the stats. It was more my groundies I felt was the issue.	12_12.a	2015-06-17	M	12	Gilles Simon	Thanasi Kokkinakis	(Question about his serve.)	12_12.q	70.0	0	2nd Round	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP500
12_13	No. No, I'm not a big rugby guy, sorry. I know it was on, but I'm not a huge fan.	12_13.a	2015-06-17	M	12	Gilles Simon	Thanasi Kokkinakis	Are you taking any interest in the rugby?	12_13.q	70.0	0	2nd Round	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP500
12_14	I saw that. Got a bit distracted, actually. Oh, there he is from Top Gear. Again, disappointing performance in front of him (laughter). What can you do sometimes? Was the guy from One Direction here too?	12_14.a	2015-06-17	M	12	Gilles Simon	Thanasi Kokkinakis	(Question about Jeremy Clarkson.)	12_14.q	70.0	0	2nd Round	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP500
12_15	Shiza. Yeah, just got to be better than that, really. Yeah, I got distracted a little bit, but I looked over when I was down like a set and double break. I was like, Ah, this is rubbish. At least I saw some important faces in the crowd. That's good.	12_15.a	2015-06-17	M	12	Gilles Simon	Thanasi Kokkinakis	Yeah.	12_15.q	70.0	0	2nd Round	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP500
12_16	No, I mean, I have listened to a couple of songs but I wouldn't say I'm a diehard fan. Yeah, it's just a good effort really what they have done. That's all I've got to say.	12_16.a	2015-06-17	M	12	Gilles Simon	Thanasi Kokkinakis	Surely you're not a One Direction fan?	12_16.q	70.0	0	2nd Round	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP500
1357_0	My coach told me that I need to hit my first serve in, to try to keep hitting the first serve, because in the first set I was really struggling with Group my serve. I had a really low percentage, and she took advantage of that. I wasn't really holding any service games in the first set, and then that changed in the second. I tried to go for it a little bit more, and I tried to play a little bit more aggressive, and it paid off.	1357_0.a	2008-05-16	F	1357	Venus Williams	Jelena Jankovic	What did your coach say to you after the second set?	1357_0.q	4.0	1	Quarterfinals	INTERNAZIONALI BNL D'ITALIA (WOMEN)	1
1357_1	I don't -- I didn't know how she felt physically, because I wasn't thinking about her. I just was thinking about my game, how I'm feeling, what I have to do in order to win. She was up 2-Love in the third and I never gave up. I just wanted to play one point at a time and just be strong out there, and I did it somehow.	1357_1.a	2008-05-16	F	1357	Venus Williams	Jelena Jankovic	In the beginning of the third set did you have a feeling that she was tired?	1357_1.q	4.0	1	Quarterfinals	INTERNAZIONALI BNL D'ITALIA (WOMEN)	1
1357_2	Sometimes this can happen. It's the luck of the draw. You cannot choose which side you're going to go. Obviously the lower -- the bottom half is much tougher than the top, but sometimes it happens. I mean, I just have to try to play my best. I have really great players to play, so I will try my best. Hopefully I can do it.	1357_2.a	2008-05-16	F	1357	Venus Williams	Jelena Jankovic	This afternoon you play against Venus, and tomorrow probably Sharapova. Do you think there is too much difference between two parts of the draw?	1357_2.q	4.0	1	Quarterfinals	INTERNAZIONALI BNL D'ITALIA (WOMEN)	1
1357_3	Technically? First of all, I've beaten her many, many times. Now I think it's, I don't know how many times, maybe four times before. I know how to play against her, and I know that I always have to give my best if I want to beat her. She's really strong, and I wanted to attack her as much as possible, put pressure on her, and do the right things. I got some advice from my coach what to do, but I don't really have to talk about it.	1357_3.a	2008-05-16	F	1357	Venus Williams	Jelena Jankovic	(From Italian) What do you think you did technically that made you beat Venus today?	1357_3.q	4.0	1	Quarterfinals	INTERNAZIONALI BNL D'ITALIA (WOMEN)	1
1357_4	Yes, that was -- today was the biggest problem, because we didn't have much time to get ready for the match. We were all in a hurry, in a panic. I didn't have time to eat before my match, so I took only a few bites and I was running to put my clothes and get ready for the match. That's why the first set I was really stressed a little bit, and then as the time went on I felt better. Because all of a sudden Serena said that she's not going on court, that she has some injury, and we didn't know what was happening. They told us we have to be ready for a 4:00 match. It's a surprise, but she has some problem, and what can we do?	1357_4.a	2008-05-16	F	1357	Venus Williams	Jelena Jankovic	How much are you surprised about the Serena retirement?	1357_4.q	4.0	1	Quarterfinals	INTERNAZIONALI BNL D'ITALIA (WOMEN)	1
1357_5	I don't know, but I really had great support from the Italian crowd. The atmosphere is really great, and the fans get involved in the match. You can see it gets quite noisy. So I really enjoyed the whole experience, and I look forward to playing again tomorrow.	1357_5.a	2008-05-16	F	1357	Venus Williams	Jelena Jankovic	Do you feel that Italian public wanted you to win? There was many applause when win a point.	1357_5.q	4.0	1	Quarterfinals	INTERNAZIONALI BNL D'ITALIA (WOMEN)	1
945_0	Nice start press conference today.  Grand Slam.  I prefer Grand Slam.  And after a Grand Slam, between Davis Cup or medal.  Right now medal because I have the Davis Cup, no?	945_0.a	2007-11-17	M	945	Roger Federer	Rafael Nadal	Olympic medal, Grand Slam champion, which do you prefer?	945_0.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	TENNIS MASTERS CUP	Masters Cup
945_1	Very tired?	945_1.a	2007-11-17	M	945	Roger Federer	Rafael Nadal	The first set up until 4-4 looked very tight.	945_1.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	TENNIS MASTERS CUP	Masters Cup
945_2	I play very good match the first set.  I have a lot of chances.  Love-30, one breakpoint.  Well, not a lot.  Love-30, one breakpoint with one forehand for have the break, the passing shot to the forehand. But, well, later he do the first break in the 5-4.  The first opportunity, he make it.  Finally the start of the second set, kill me, no?  I tried.  I was focused for try to continue, but he play unbelievable in the beginning, no?  Playing very crazy inside the court was start to not do mistakes.  Was very tough for me the beginning of the second. And finally he give me the second break and the match was finished, now?  I fight.  I fight.  I fight.  I try to stay in the match, but he play very well today.  Nothing to say.  Just congratulate him.	945_2.a	2007-11-17	M	945	Roger Federer	Rafael Nadal	Tight.  One could argue that you played a cleaner first few games than Roger, and then he broke you and sort of ran away with things.	945_2.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	TENNIS MASTERS CUP	Masters Cup
945_3	No, no, no, because I beat him a lot of -- sometimes without serve very well.  The key of the match was not the serve.  Never, no? The key, especially in this surface, first is if he cannot play his best tennis, no, if he don't have the best day, it will be easier for me, you know.  And after, well, I have to play very focused all the time. Today I didn't get the rhythm because the play was very aggressive.  Was difficult for me stay in the match.  And when I need the rhythm, the rhythm wasn't there because they put me lot of aces, they play very aggressive in the return all the time.  So was very difficult play with good rhythm, no?  And for beat him, is important for have a good rhythm. Well, is important serve well.  Not against Roger, but against everybody.  Against Roger, too.  But very important serve well against everybody.  I improve the serve in the last months.  I am serving a little bit better.  So I think it's continuing improving for next year, no? I have one month right now for try to continuing improve every day.  I am young, no, and I have to continuing.  Anyway, I have to try.  I don't know if I gonna do, but I have to try.	945_3.a	2007-11-17	M	945	Roger Federer	Rafael Nadal	You looked good on the service at the beginning of the first set.  How important is it not to let him get ahead of you?  Is that the key to everything in a match against Roger?	945_3.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	TENNIS MASTERS CUP	Masters Cup
945_4	Anything can happen, no?  Roger is the favorite because the style of Roger is not easy for David.  The final is three sets or five sets?	945_4.a	2007-11-17	M	945	Roger Federer	Rafael Nadal	Roger and David will meet in the final.  David is one of the best performing players in this tournament.  Roger beat you tonight within one hour.  What do you think is going to happen in the final?	945_4.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	TENNIS MASTERS CUP	Masters Cup
945_5	Five sets.  Well, David has his chances because he arrive to this final with his best performance ever, no?  He never was playing like this before.  So he's doing very well everything, playing with very good confidence.  And if he believe on the victory, he gonna has his chances, no? Always if Roger is not at his top level -- if Roger is at his top level going to be very tough, no, because is difficult.  David needs a little bit the rhythm, too.  If Roger serving like today is going to be difficult. Anyway, David is very good returner.  He has a very good return.  We will see tomorrow.  Going to be interesting match.  I wish -- I just say best of luck to David, and Roger, too.  But David is from Spain.  If David won here, is very good news for the tennis, especially in Spain, no?	945_5.a	2007-11-17	M	945	Roger Federer	Rafael Nadal	Five sets.	945_5.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	TENNIS MASTERS CUP	Masters Cup
945_6	No, he won because he played better tonight.  On this surface at this moment I think -- no, I am totally sure he is better than me.  If he is playing very good, I have to play unbelievable for try to play against him, no?  If not, it's impossible, especially if he's playing with good confidence. And today he's playing very inside the court and was very difficult for me.	945_6.a	2007-11-17	M	945	Roger Federer	Rafael Nadal	Do you think he won this game tonight because he served in such an amazing way tonight?  Do you want to do some work to improve your return?	945_6.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	TENNIS MASTERS CUP	Masters Cup
945_7	No, no, no.  Everything is going well.  No.2 in the world for third year in a row.  5,600 points.  I don't know if I am the best No.2 in the history by points, but one of those ones for sure.  With these points, in a normal situation, I am the No.1 in 75% of the situations, no?  So I think the things is going very well. I don't have to change a lot of things.  I have to continuing improve my things and I have to try to improve my serve more and more.  I have to continuing trying improve my return, my aggressive return, continuing improve the volley, the slice.  I improve a lot this year the slice, the volley.  I am going more times to the net. So that is important point for me.  But I have to continuing do for be better player, no?  But didn't change too much things.  You say something about the healthy.  So the problem only was one.  I wasn't play the US Open with my best performance because I have a problem in the knees.  But for the rest, I am the third player or the second player of the tour or the first.  I don't know exactly who play more matches every season, and I didn't lose any important tournament. Only the US Open I have this problem.  If this problem I have, I don't know, three weeks after when I have to go to Bangkok, no one going to speak something about that. So I didn't have the best of luck in this situation, no?  But I play a lot of matches.  I play a lot of weeks, a lot of matches every weeks.  I play Monte-Carlo, Barcelona, Rome, Hamburg, Paris, Wimbledon.  The same every time the final.  So is very difficult be a hundred percent always. But this year I didn't have any problem.  Only the US Open.  So that's very good year for me and very good news because physically I was very good all the year.  But sometimes the people always are speaking, Rafa is injury.  No, I am not injury.  Sometimes I have some problems, but the normal problems like every player, no?	945_7.a	2007-11-17	M	945	Roger Federer	Rafael Nadal	Are you going to approach next season differently at all, play fewer tournaments or train in a different way, to make sure you maintain your health?	945_7.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	TENNIS MASTERS CUP	Masters Cup
945_8	In a row?	945_8.a	2007-11-17	M	945	Roger Federer	Rafael Nadal	At one point Roger won 20 of 21 points from 4-4 in the first set.	945_8.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	TENNIS MASTERS CUP	Masters Cup
945_9	20?	945_9.a	2007-11-17	M	945	Roger Federer	Rafael Nadal	He won 20 of 21.  He won a lot of points in a row.	945_9.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	TENNIS MASTERS CUP	Masters Cup
945_10	That's a lot (smiling).  I don't think, no.	945_10.a	2007-11-17	M	945	Roger Federer	Rafael Nadal	Something like that.	945_10.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	TENNIS MASTERS CUP	Masters Cup
945_11	No, I remember unbelievable set from him.  Two.  The first set of Wimbledon of 2006, and the first set of Dubai 2006 was unbelievable, too. Today when he start was very tough stop him, no?  But I remember better moments from him.  But from the 4-4 to the 4-1 or 4-0 in the second set was unbelievable him.  When he's playing in this way, it's impossible to stop him.	945_11.a	2007-11-17	M	945	Roger Federer	Rafael Nadal	How frustrating was that period of the match?  Is that the best Roger has played against you?	945_11.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	TENNIS MASTERS CUP	Masters Cup
945_12	I understand your question, but I didn't understand the beginning of the question.  What's happening?  Well, he beat me in Hamburg.  He beat me in Wimbledon, his best surface.  I had more chances to win against him than he won against me in this match. But, anyway, that's doesn't matter because I always say the same.  This is not a competition against Roger.  This is a competition against the other guys of the tour because I always said Roger, when he's a hundred percent, he playing another league. So I never compete against Roger.  This year I have some chances for be No.1.  Yes, the watch of Wimbledon was very, very important for try to be No.1.  I have chances.  I had a lot of chances for won this match.  Finally I lost. And anyway, was the year when I was closer to him.  I lost three times, I won two.  But always it depends of the moment or the situation.  Last year I don't know if I won more times than him, but I play more times on clay.  So this year I play three times and I won two.  And in grass... Is the same if he think right now you are closer to Roger on grass.  No, why?  He beat me anyway.  So I don't think.  I think is depends always of the moment.	945_12.a	2007-11-17	M	945	Roger Federer	Rafael Nadal	With the win tonight, Roger is now having a better record against you in 2007 with three wins and two losses.  On clay court, he is having more chances to play against you than a couple years ago.  Do you think now you may lose advantage to play him mentally and technically?	945_12.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	TENNIS MASTERS CUP	Masters Cup
2819_0	Yeah, you know, it's nice to have -- I have a feeling out there where you feel like you can -- where your brain and your arm is kind of connecting, you know. I think in Indian Wells it was a completely different story. Gradually, throughout the two weeks that I've been, you know, preparing myself, after I lost to Kleybanova, I've been really trying to focus on getting my swing back and, you know, the feeling where you can, you know, like play freely, have a loose arm. That's the feeling when I'm out there playing. It's a nice feeling to have. But, you know, I know from the past and I've learned from the past that it can change very quickly, as well. I just want to try to maintain this feeling and keep focusing, practice on just moving well and taking small steps.	2819_0.a	2010-03-28	F	2819	Shahar Peer	Kim Clijsters	Your first two matches, you're treating your opponents rather rudely. I don't think you've lost serve or even come close to it. You must be feeling in a nice groove as you move along here?	2819_0.q	16.0	1	3rd Round	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Premier
2819_1	And I gave it back? (Laughing.)	2819_1.a	2010-03-28	F	2819	Shahar Peer	Kim Clijsters	I notice against Kleybanova, looks like she was trying to give you the match a few times. You didn't want it.	2819_1.q	16.0	1	3rd Round	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Premier
2819_2	No, it was just -- yeah, I mean, I felt that I was trying to rush. You know, when I was up I was trying to rush through it a little bit too much instead of being a little more patient. And I think a couple of times too, like I was just being -- you know with rushing, I mean, you know, not playing-wise -- in between the points and playing-wise I think I was just being a little bit too defensive and I was waiting for her to make the mistakes instead me just keeping playing my game and being aggressive. I think that's the difference now. I really feel that I'm dominating a lot of the points, where I think in the match against Kleybanova I felt like I was being put under pressure a lot of the times. Now it becomes more of an automatic reaction, where I'm stepping into the court, and where in Indian Wells I constantly had to remind myself, Be aggressive; dominate the points. It wasn't automatic, like, yeah, I wasn't just playing my game. Now it's just a nice feeling to know, that whenever I get pushed back by my opponent, I automatically take like a few steps forward to just be on top of the baseline again. I think that's a good feeling to have, knowing that it's coming back naturally again.	2819_2.a	2010-03-28	F	2819	Shahar Peer	Kim Clijsters	Were you there mentally that match? Were you somewhere else?	2819_2.q	16.0	1	3rd Round	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Premier
2819_3	No, I think -- you know she's an opponent to me -- I've played her in the past. In Sydney I think I played her a few years ago. She's a player who is not going to hit you off the court, but her strongest point is that she usually doesn't make a lot of errors. I think she takes the ball like early, like on the rise. I think, you know, just because she doesn't have that real powerful game, I really didn't feel like I was threatened by her groundstrokes a lot. So I really felt that I was, you know, just like dominating in a lot of the points and felt very comfortable just standing on top of my baseline and trying to make her move from side to side until I felt like I could take a couple steps in and go for the winner.	2819_3.a	2010-03-28	F	2819	Shahar Peer	Kim Clijsters	Were you a little surprised today? Because she has had some game, obviously, through the years, but she didn't have much to give you today.	2819_3.q	16.0	1	3rd Round	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Premier
2819_4	No, just practice. You just have to try to get through that in practice. I think there's -- you know, I try to hit with as many girls, different players. I hit with Na Li; I hit with a lot of different girls. I think that's something that you automatically need to create that a little bit, that sensation a little bit in practice. It wasn't there from the beginning. What I felt like gradually each practice I had here in Miami and before I played my first round, I felt like it was slowly getting better. Yeah, just practice. I don't think there's anybody who can tell you you have to do this and all of a sudden it has to switch. It has to come from within yourself. It takes time. And, you know, I think the most important thing is not to get frustrated. That's something that you have to tell yourself, too. It's okay; it will change. Even if things are not going well, just like don't get frustrated by it.	2819_4.a	2010-03-28	F	2819	Shahar Peer	Kim Clijsters	How did you get that mental difference? Did you see a sports psychologist? Did you talk to your husband? Play with your kid more? How did you do it?	2819_4.q	16.0	1	3rd Round	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Premier
2819_5	When we -- you know, trips like this when we -- you know, I played at Madison Square Garden, so we were there a couple weeks before. We'll probably go there a few days when I'm done here in Miami, and then we'll go back to Belgium to prepare for Fed Cup and the clay court season. So whenever it fits in in going, obviously, to the States. After Wimbledon we'll go couple weeks earlier just to prepare on the hardcourts. But Belgium is still the base.	2819_5.a	2010-03-28	F	2819	Shahar Peer	Kim Clijsters	How much time are you spending in New Jersey?	2819_5.q	16.0	1	3rd Round	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Premier
2819_6	Well, I don't totally agree. We don't live in like -- we live in a smaller town. It's near the water, which is very nice, but it has that small-town feeling to me. You know, I could never live in a place like New York. I love going there and we do drive up there once in a while just for a night or a weekend or so. But, yeah, I like to hear the birds, you know, in the morning. The taxis and stuff, it's not for me.	2819_6.a	2010-03-28	F	2819	Shahar Peer	Kim Clijsters	Obviously your hometown is a small town. New Jersey is like practically New York. How does that...	2819_6.q	16.0	1	3rd Round	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Premier
2819_7	In Wall.	2819_7.a	2010-03-28	F	2819	Shahar Peer	Kim Clijsters	So where in New Jersey is it?	2819_7.q	16.0	1	3rd Round	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Premier
2819_8	Yeah.	2819_8.a	2010-03-28	F	2819	Shahar Peer	Kim Clijsters	Wall?	2819_8.q	16.0	1	3rd Round	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Premier
2819_9	I just asked my coach. I said, Who do I play now? He told me Safarova or Azarenka. They're all tough. I mean, you know, obviously the closer you get towards the end of the tournament every match is gonna be tough. And especially in my situation now too because, I feel like in practice I've been really focusing on just my game and just trying to get, you know, back into where I feel comfortable. So I'm not really -- so that's what I'm focusing on, is really on myself and trying to just, you know, maintain this feeling that I've been having. So you don't really want to get too influenced by your opponents, I think. Obviously there are some tactics that you take, you know, on court with you that you have in the back of your head. But I think I will always start with, you know, with my strengths and try to -- and then if that doesn't work, if I feel that my opponent has an answer to everything that I'm doing, then you'll try to mix it up. I will always start from going with my strong points.	2819_9.a	2010-03-28	F	2819	Shahar Peer	Kim Clijsters	Do you look at your draw? To me, you're in the tougher side of the draw. You have Azarenka maybe next if she wins, Wozniacki somewhere, Henin somewhere. Do you look at it?	2819_9.q	16.0	1	3rd Round	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Premier
2819_10	Today's?	2819_10.a	2010-03-28	F	2819	Shahar Peer	Kim Clijsters	In terms of the matches you played this year, where would that one rate amongst your performances?	2819_10.q	16.0	1	3rd Round	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Premier
2819_11	I think these last two, what I'm probably most happy about is the way I mentally just stayed really focused. I think in Brisbane and Australia I played good tennis and high-level tennis, but I think there was always a bit of a dip in those matches. I think that's something that's really a lot better now, is that I can really, yeah, just mentally just -- and, yeah, even when things are not going as well or when I'm not feeling the ball as well, I just have a lot more of a positive attitude about it instead of maybe doubting yourself a little bit more or, yeah, start worrying a little bit. I think it's something that I feel a lot more confident in that way. Then again, you know, I think it's also by the losses I've had. I think it also helps you by maintaining that attitude, I think.	2819_11.a	2010-03-28	F	2819	Shahar Peer	Kim Clijsters	Today's, yes.	2819_11.q	16.0	1	3rd Round	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Premier
2819_12	Um, a lot more luggage and you know, all that stuff. But it's fun. I mean, I like it. There's obviously a lot of surprises. I think as, you know, first-time mother, I think it's always -- a lot of surprises will happen anyway. But then being on the road and obviously when they get sick once in a while, those are little things that you worry a little bit more. You obviously worry more than, you know, a few years ago. But it's good. I mean, I enjoy taking care of her when I don't have to be here at the courts and go home. You know, I look forward to it every day. It's fun. I mean, to me, it's -- the best part of my life is being a mother, so it's something that I really love.	2819_12.a	2010-03-28	F	2819	Shahar Peer	Kim Clijsters	How is it now traveling with a child?	2819_12.q	16.0	1	3rd Round	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Premier
2819_13	She knows I play tennis. Like when I leave hotel or when I leave home, she knows I'm off going to play tennis with Wim, she calls my coach. Like, Mommy and Wim are going to play tennis. She doesn't know what it -- you know, everything else that's around us. I mean, she doesn't -- she's too young. She just turned two about a month ago. No, she knows I play tennis, and, you know, that's all.	2819_13.a	2010-03-28	F	2819	Shahar Peer	Kim Clijsters	How many matches has Jada come to? Is she aware now what you do and who you are?	2819_13.q	16.0	1	3rd Round	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Premier
4570_0	Yeah, I think, you know, I think it was great match from both of us, and I think that she just serve much better than me. I think there were some really important points that I could play better. I think that was the different.	4570_0.a	2012-07-03	F	4570	Serena Williams	Petra Kvitova	If you could have that match again, is there anything you'd do differently?	4570_0.q	4.0	0	Quarterfinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4570_1	Yeah, I think, you know, she had a big serve again. The return was to the net, so, I mean, it happened. It's tennis. That's it.	4570_1.a	2012-07-03	F	4570	Serena Williams	Petra Kvitova	On set point at 45 there in the second set really a crucial turning point?	4570_1.q	4.0	0	Quarterfinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4570_2	For me it was difficult first round when I went to Centre Court and played the first round because, you know, it was really big match for opening tournament. You know exactly when you are playing. That was tough for me to be strong mentally because I played badly before, so I didn't felt much better. Yeah, then I think after the first round was good and I didn't thinking about that I'm defending champion. I just played every match what I did and I was more relaxed.	4570_2.a	2012-07-03	F	4570	Serena Williams	Petra Kvitova	How has it felt being a Wimbledon champion here? Has it been difficult, the expectation? Do you find it a happy or difficult experience?	4570_2.q	4.0	0	Quarterfinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4570_3	Not that much. I mean, yeah, like the tennis is very open right now, so I didn't feel like I'm big favorite. You know, I didn't feel the pressure that much.	4570_3.a	2012-07-03	F	4570	Serena Williams	Petra Kvitova	Did you feel under any pressure in this tournament because of that?	4570_3.q	4.0	0	Quarterfinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4570_4	No, I didn't thinking about this. It was just match that I went on the court and not about something else.	4570_4.a	2012-07-03	F	4570	Serena Williams	Petra Kvitova	Did you sense that Serena was particularly keen to beat you because you were the defending champion? In the buildup she made a few comments she was quite looking forward to playing you because you had the title and we got the sense that she's very keen to get it back.	4570_4.q	4.0	0	Quarterfinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4570_5	I think so.	4570_5.a	2012-07-03	F	4570	Serena Williams	Petra Kvitova	Do you think she'll win now?	4570_5.q	4.0	0	Quarterfinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4570_6	I think that I didn't play badly, so I think that she just serve very well. It's looks like in the last game that I did almost four aces. So, yeah, I think this was really the big different.	4570_6.a	2012-07-03	F	4570	Serena Williams	Petra Kvitova	When she's playing this sort of tennis, how would you describe the difficulty in doing anything against her, not just for you but for any of the players?	4570_6.q	4.0	0	Quarterfinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4570_7	It is big difficult.	4570_7.a	2012-07-03	F	4570	Serena Williams	Petra Kvitova	How difficult is it for anybody to beat her when she's playing like this?	4570_7.q	4.0	0	Quarterfinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4570_8	I can't say impossible. She's human. Yeah, I think that's why she's the great champion, because she knows what she needs to play in the important points. So I think that it's really tough to beat her.	4570_8.a	2012-07-03	F	4570	Serena Williams	Petra Kvitova	Impossible?	4570_8.q	4.0	0	Quarterfinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4570_9	I have a trophy at home, so I'm still happy for this. But, yeah, unfortunately I have to leave this tournament in the quarters. But, yeah, I know that I have a lot to build on. I hope I can be stronger and I can improve everything in my game. I'm looking forward for the Olympics here.	4570_9.a	2012-07-03	F	4570	Serena Williams	Petra Kvitova	Now that your title is gone, how does it feel? Obviously you're disappointed.	4570_9.q	4.0	0	Quarterfinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4570_10	Yeah, I think she expected my serve will come to the backhand because she has a really great return from the forehand. So it wasn't nice to just have like second serve to the forehand, so it was better for me to go to the backhand. Yeah, I think she knows it before. That's why she could play that like the returns today.	4570_10.a	2012-07-03	F	4570	Serena Williams	Petra Kvitova	You have an excellent lefthanded serve, and it usually works very well against righthanded players against the backhand. She seemed to hit her backhand very, very well today. Is that your impression?	4570_10.q	4.0	0	Quarterfinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4570_11	No. I have a BMW.	4570_11.a	2012-07-03	F	4570	Serena Williams	Petra Kvitova	Have you traded in your Skoda?	4570_11.q	4.0	0	Quarterfinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4570_12	Actually it was unlucky, because it's looks like that I can keep it, but it was about the managing.	4570_12.a	2012-07-03	F	4570	Serena Williams	Petra Kvitova	What did you do with the other car?	4570_12.q	4.0	0	Quarterfinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1913_0	Yeah, I think it was a little bit easier match today, especially because of the weather conditions. It was not that hot. I think we were lucky to play in the Hisense Arena, which is not as windy as outside courts. So, yeah, I think just played a little bit better. This is what I need if I want to improve, if I want to go all the way. Just very glad I could win in two sets.	1913_0.a	2009-01-22	F	1913	nan	Elena Dementieva	That seemed to be better than your first one. What was your assessment of your form?	1913_0.q	4.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1913_1	I don't know actually. I didn't count (smiling).	1913_1.a	2009-01-22	F	1913	nan	Elena Dementieva	Is this the best winning streak of your career?	1913_1.q	4.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1913_2	Yeah, it is a good feeling, you know. I feel like I had a very good start of the year. Right now it's the most important moment. That's why we're coming here to play the Australian Open. I just hope to play well here.	1913_2.a	2009-01-22	F	1913	nan	Elena Dementieva	Must be a good feeling, 12 in a row.	1913_2.q	4.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1913_3	I think the preparation was a little bit different. Instead of practicing Moscow indoors, I just spend all the time in Miami, you know, practicing outside in a similar condition as here. It really helps me, you know, to get used to the weather conditions in Australia. Just much more easy physically to play right now.	1913_3.a	2009-01-22	F	1913	nan	Elena Dementieva	What do you put your good form down to? Your preparation must have been terrific.	1913_3.q	4.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1913_4	I mean, I was working on everything, you know, especially on my serve, but the baseline as well, the volley game. I mean, everything needs to be improved. I feel like I did a little bit improvement, but still lots of work needs to be done.	1913_4.a	2009-01-22	F	1913	nan	Elena Dementieva	What part of your game has improved the most over the last couple of years?	1913_4.q	4.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1913_5	Well, I'm not thinking about my chances. I'm really enjoying, you know, the way I'm playing right now. Just want to go as far as I can, just enjoy every single match I play here.	1913_5.a	2009-01-22	F	1913	nan	Elena Dementieva	Do you feel this is your best chance to win the Australian Open?	1913_5.q	4.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1913_6	You know, I just don't think about it. I just like to play, and that's what I'm here for. I don't think about all the pressure or not, you know, the media attention or not. I'm here to play. That's what I like to do.	1913_6.a	2009-01-22	F	1913	nan	Elena Dementieva	Are you enjoying being in the shadows a bit? Is that how you prefer it?	1913_6.q	4.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
226_0	Well, she's a big hitter. She's putting a lot of pressure on you. Serving really big. It's hard to kind of break into her serve. It puts extra pressure on your serve. She was just going for it today, striking it well. I mean, we had a great first set. Then I did couple mistakes. Especially my serve went down little bit. She just took the opportunity.	226_0.a	2015-08-29	F	226	Petra Kvitova	Lucie Safarova	What makes her so difficult to play against?	226_0.q	6.0	0	The Final	CONNECTICUT OPEN	Premier
226_1	I think it was my serve that was working, so I was kind of holding with her the level, was striking very well from both sides. Was very close. Had a great ending in the tiebreak. Then my level dropped little bit. She just was the more stable one today.	226_1.a	2015-08-29	F	226	Petra Kvitova	Lucie Safarova	What was working for you in the first set?	226_1.q	6.0	0	The Final	CONNECTICUT OPEN	Premier
226_2	Maybe I got a little tired, yeah.	226_2.a	2015-08-29	F	226	Petra Kvitova	Lucie Safarova	Do you feel anything in particular changed on your serve?	226_2.q	6.0	0	The Final	CONNECTICUT OPEN	Premier
226_3	I guess so, yeah. I felt it was on.	226_3.a	2015-08-29	F	226	Petra Kvitova	Lucie Safarova	When you had the one breakpoint, was her serve just on today?	226_3.q	6.0	0	The Final	CONNECTICUT OPEN	Premier
226_4	Yeah, yeah. We know each other so well. Obviously training in the same club, playing all those Fed Cups, traveling on the tournaments. It's never nice to face a friend. But it's a game. We both want to win. We are both out there. But it's not a nice feeling.	226_4.a	2015-08-29	F	226	Petra Kvitova	Lucie Safarova	Petra said it's hard to put your friendship aside sometimes, if you make a mistake or she makes a mistake. Is it the same for you?	226_4.q	6.0	0	The Final	CONNECTICUT OPEN	Premier
226_5	Well, the Nike family (laughter). Both lefties, all the same. It felt like playing a Fed Cup actually, just against each other.	226_5.a	2015-08-29	F	226	Petra Kvitova	Lucie Safarova	What about the coordinating outfits?	226_5.q	6.0	0	The Final	CONNECTICUT OPEN	Premier
226_6	We play on Tuesday. I mean, we played just here, so I guess we both know what to expect from each other. Yeah, I got the win here. I hope to be more confident there, to win the match obviously.	226_6.a	2015-08-29	F	226	Petra Kvitova	Lucie Safarova	Can you talk about going into your next match.	226_6.q	6.0	0	The Final	CONNECTICUT OPEN	Premier
226_7	Yeah. I mean, I really enjoyed the week. It was a fun week here. I got plenty of matches, plenty of hours on the court, which helps for the Open hopefully. Yeah, let's transfer it there.	226_7.a	2015-08-29	F	226	Petra Kvitova	Lucie Safarova	Did this tournament give you what you expected from it?	226_7.q	6.0	0	The Final	CONNECTICUT OPEN	Premier
3210_0	Well, it was pretty impressive to enter this Rod Laver court against Kim Clijsters. I was feeling a bit stressed the two first games, but I got into the match. I just tried to fight the best I can. Well, I think I could have played way better and she could have played way better, as well. I cannot say I'm so disappointed, but I have some regrets because I think I could have done better in the first set, and I think I didn't believe enough in myself, so that's just a shame. That's all.	3210_0.a	2011-01-22	F	3210	Kim Clijsters	Alize Cornet	How did you feel you got into the match eventually? It was difficult to begin with, then did you feel you were getting into it a bit more?	3210_0.q	83.0	0	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3210_1	Well, she takes the ball very early. She plays very, very fast and close to the line. Well, she showed today that she was not volleying so well, so I think she has some work to do on this compartment of the game. She plays great. Like she's always fighting from the first point till the end, and she's very consistent, very powerful. So, yeah, for me she's just the favorite of the tournament.	3210_1.a	2011-01-22	F	3210	Kim Clijsters	Alize Cornet	What is difficult about her?	3210_1.q	83.0	0	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1842_0	Well, I would say so. You know, it was first time for me to play not only for the Grand Slam, but it's also for No.1 spot. And I never been through this situation, you know, and she was already. So, I mean, she was much more times in this situation. I would say she was much more experienced than I was today stepping on the court.	1842_0.a	2009-01-31	F	1842	Serena Williams	Dinara Safina	Was it just simply a bad case of nerves tonight?	1842_0.q	3.0	0	The Final	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1842_1	Of course. You know, after, you know, every loss you just have to take things, what was wrong. And now it's gonna be back to training and just do it better.	1842_1.a	2009-01-31	F	1842	Serena Williams	Dinara Safina	Is there anything you can take out of the match for the future?	1842_1.q	3.0	0	The Final	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1842_2	I was feeling good, you know. But then, of course, once you step in the court, it's different situation. But I was not nervous, not even close like before the French Open final. I couldn't even sleep the night. But today I slept good and everything was fine. But just pity.	1842_2.a	2009-01-31	F	1842	Serena Williams	Dinara Safina	How did you feel before the match? Did you feel ready to go?	1842_2.q	3.0	0	The Final	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1842_3	Not really (laughter). You know, maybe couple days, yes. But today, I don't know, maybe was not -- I wasn't me on the court, you know.	1842_3.a	2009-01-31	F	1842	Serena Williams	Dinara Safina	When it finished, did you feel like going out and playing again?	1842_3.q	3.0	0	The Final	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1842_4	Well, my serve, I think the whole tournament I was struggling with my serve. I don't know. I've been working on my serve. Everything was fine. And just suddenly, I don't know, just serving double-faults. And I was like, Okay, now at least it was flying somewhere. First few matches it was double-fault, but 110. Today was double-fault 150. Each match I was serving a little bit harder. Now I just have to go back, take a little time and get everything back in the place. I mean, I had three weeks in a row - four weeks with a Grand Slam. Of course, by playing every day matches from Hopman Cup, it's tough to practice, you know. Once you play match, everything goes a little bit, you know, the technique just goes back. Now I want to go back and I'll have few days and just put everything together and I'll get ready for Dubai.	1842_4.a	2009-01-31	F	1842	Serena Williams	Dinara Safina	Could you tell that after a couple points, the double-faults, that felt wrong then?	1842_4.q	3.0	0	The Final	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1842_5	Well, with her, you know, she doesn't play that many tournaments. That's the problem by her. You know, if she plays every week, like most of the players does, then, of course, it will be tough. But, I mean, she's a champion. She proved it. It just depends on her.	1842_5.a	2009-01-31	F	1842	Serena Williams	Dinara Safina	How long do you think she can stay No.1 if she performs like this tonight?	1842_5.q	3.0	0	The Final	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1842_6	At the moment I just feel really like tired. I think maybe because everything, like adrenaline went down. As you know, once you're in a tournament, you know, you're always trying to stay positive, you know, like come on. Even if you feel tired, you're trying to escape these thoughts that even come into the mind because you know you still need the energy. But now, once it's over, really now I was sitting out and talking with my coach, and I felt like I'm just exhausted, like dead.	1842_6.a	2009-01-31	F	1842	Serena Williams	Dinara Safina	Do you feel anger besides disappointment?	1842_6.q	3.0	0	The Final	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1842_7	Even like I lost the set, I was like, Okay, still, like come on. Tried, but, you know, my serve was letting me down, so... After I hold it for two times, but just during the match I was not giving her any trouble with my serve. Normally my serve is my weapon. So playing without all my weapons, it's tough against her.	1842_7.a	2009-01-31	F	1842	Serena Williams	Dinara Safina	Did you feel you played yourself back into the match when you broke Serena early in the second?	1842_7.q	3.0	0	The Final	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1842_8	No, today I wouldn't say that I was negative on the court, nothing. I was trying to stay positive and I was trying to do something. Just didn't had enough time to do it. It was too fast, you know, everything.	1842_8.a	2009-01-31	F	1842	Serena Williams	Dinara Safina	You said that sometimes when you go out there and play, you play yourself, and sometimes you play the opponent. Who did you think you were playing today?	1842_8.q	3.0	0	The Final	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1842_9	I think she did. You know, she played exactly the way she had to play and she was much more aggressive and she just was taking time out of me, so I didn't have that much time to put back myself onto the court. She didn't even let me to come into the match.	1842_9.a	2009-01-31	F	1842	Serena Williams	Dinara Safina	Do you think she played well today?	1842_9.q	3.0	0	The Final	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1842_10	Well, I hope it's not the last one, you know. I still have time. And just, you know, I'll go on the court now and practice. Those mistakes that I've been doing, just will try to work as hard as I can that they will never happen again. After every lose, I try to take what was good and what was wrong, and to work on my weaknesses, to get them better, that my opponents will not have that easy next time.	1842_10.a	2009-01-31	F	1842	Serena Williams	Dinara Safina	How difficult is it to bounce back from something like this?	1842_10.q	3.0	0	The Final	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1842_11	It's both disappointing, you know. You cannot pick one. I feel the same, you know, disappointing. French Open and here. I would say today that I was not able maybe to show my game, you know. It's also very disappointing.	1842_11.a	2009-01-31	F	1842	Serena Williams	Dinara Safina	Can you compare the disappointment you feel now to what you felt in Paris?	1842_11.q	3.0	0	The Final	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1842_12	No, just nothing. Just few words we were talking. We started to talk about Hopman Cup, all these things, but not much.	1842_12.a	2009-01-31	F	1842	Serena Williams	Dinara Safina	When you were waiting for the ceremony, Serena made you smile again. What did you talk about?	1842_12.q	3.0	0	The Final	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1842_13	Well, she puts pressure, you know, because she's aggressive. It's not that you doubt in myself. She pushes you to go a little bit for more because you don't want to give her any easy ball because you know that she will go for it. Either she makes it or misses, but most of the time she makes it. It's just that she puts pressure, that's all. But you cannot doubt in yourself.	1842_13.a	2009-01-31	F	1842	Serena Williams	Dinara Safina	Playing Serena, does she make you doubt yourself more than other players?	1842_13.q	3.0	0	The Final	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1842_14	If I would lose the first round, of course I would sit here and I would start to think. But I lost in the final, you know. I made all the way. There is much more positive than negative. So just I lost the match, and now it's back to training. I don't see any reason to panic or to make thousand thoughts in my mind.	1842_14.a	2009-01-31	F	1842	Serena Williams	Dinara Safina	You said you're going to go out and work on your serve from tonight's match. How long will it take you to get over a loss like this?	1842_14.q	3.0	0	The Final	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1842_15	I don't know, and Justine. I don't know. For me, either because just like the way was Justine. I think for me, Justine was best. Not I don't have anything against Serena, but I love the way Justine was playing. I love the way she was on the court and all these things. Just maybe I like more Justine.	1842_15.a	2009-01-31	F	1842	Serena Williams	Dinara Safina	Is she the best player you've ever played against? Would you rate her that high?	1842_15.q	3.0	0	The Final	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1842_16	I don't know. I put my phone in the bag of my coach and I can't even get it. I don't even know who text me.	1842_16.a	2009-01-31	F	1842	Serena Williams	Dinara Safina	Have you heard from Marat yet?	1842_16.q	3.0	0	The Final	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
6306_0	Yeah, I kind of yeah, I don't know if I was really yeah, maybe I was wrongfooted a little bit, but sometimes I mean, it wasn't too hot today, but the courts, they get quite sticky. Sometimes like if you, yeah, don't anticipate where the ball is going properly, yeah, my left ankle just kind of went from underneath me a little bit. It was just a bit sore, but it's fine now. I mean, it was just sore for about three or four points, but it was fine after that.	6306_0.a	2014-08-13	M	6306	Joao Sousa	Andy Murray	The ankle, you seemed to be favoring it in the first set when you were sent the wrong way.	6306_0.q	9.0	1	2nd Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN OPEN	Masters 1000
6306_1	Yeah, today it was okay, yeah. The conditions are completely different here to Toronto. A few of the guys that have come in late have struggled with the conditions. I hit the ball well from the back of the court today. I was able to control the ball well. That was, for me, the most pleasing thing about the match today, because I have seen a lot of the players have struggled so far.	6306_1.a	2014-08-13	M	6306	Joao Sousa	Andy Murray	Do you continue to be pleased with your level?	6306_1.q	9.0	1	2nd Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN OPEN	Masters 1000
6306_2	I think so. I always find it pretty different, Canada to here. It's always different. Takes a bit of time, you know. Even just, you know, the courts in Canada. It's a huge, huge runback and Toronto. Here it's a very tight center court. There's not much space to move around. That changes things. And also speed of the court is a bit different, too. It just takes time to get used to.	6306_2.a	2014-08-13	M	6306	Joao Sousa	Andy Murray	Is it a big adjustment when you play the first match here, then?	6306_2.q	9.0	1	2nd Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN OPEN	Masters 1000
6306_3	Yeah, when we were warming up today at like 9:30 it was pretty cool. That's strange. I have seen that once or twice here, but not often. But, yeah, I'm sure it will heat up a bit for us.	6306_3.a	2014-08-13	M	6306	Joao Sousa	Andy Murray	Compared to the weather in Canada, we haven't had that heat and humidity like usual.	6306_3.q	9.0	1	2nd Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN OPEN	Masters 1000
6306_4	I mean, it makes it easier to play in, yeah. I mean, in terms of how much it changes the conditions, I mean, it slows things down a bit. But, you know, I think that the humidity is what can you know, if it's cold and humid, that's extremely slow. You know, today I don't think it was that humid. Didn't feel that humid at all. So the air, when it's a bit drier the ball flies through the air a bit quicker.	6306_4.a	2014-08-13	M	6306	Joao Sousa	Andy Murray	Does that make a difference? Make it easier?	6306_4.q	9.0	1	2nd Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN OPEN	Masters 1000
6306_5	I would like to, yeah. I mean, that would help. I don't actually know I mean, I normally follow the race. I don't really know exactly well, at this stage of the year I'd not normally look at the race, but I really don't know what I would have to do to get seeded in the top 8. A few of the guys ahead of me have lost. I don't know if they're dropping points or anything. I'm not sure. But, yeah, ideally you'd be in the top 8, yeah.	6306_5.a	2014-08-13	M	6306	Joao Sousa	Andy Murray	Is it important to you at all to get into the top 8 seeds?	6306_5.q	9.0	1	2nd Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN OPEN	Masters 1000
6306_6	No, not really. I mean, when I went over to Miami after Wimbledon I obviously had to make sure I got myself back into my best shape. That was really my goal after Wimbledon, because I felt like I was starting to play well. I felt like I played pretty well at the French and obviously that bit during Wimbledon. Yeah, maybe I was just lacking a bit physically. That was the one thing I really wanted to work on. But, you know, it's been a tough year. There has been a few things happened. Obviously coming back from the surgery is hard. To me now that isn't in any way an excuse. Now I have had enough time to get over it obviously with Ivan. That was also tough. And then, yeah, the results on the court haven't been as good as previous years, either. So it's been a tough year so far, yeah. A lot can change in a week in tennis, as you saw with Tsonga last week that came out of nowhere and also this week he only won five games. A lot can happen in a week.	6306_6.a	2014-08-13	M	6306	Joao Sousa	Andy Murray	Is it a slightly different experience, you know, from what you have experienced the last few years anyway to be that far away from the top 4? Does it affect the way you approach your tennis?	6306_6.q	9.0	1	2nd Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN OPEN	Masters 1000
6306_7	I mean, there's a lot of things, aside from what she's done obviously on the court. She communicates well, I feel like we communicate very well together. I find her very easy to talk to and discuss things with. She listens well, which I think is a very important quality in a coach. Especially if it's going to work long term I think that's important. She's worked well with the rest of the team and understood kind of how we work and have worked in the past. So, you know, the training block in Miami I didn't actually play loads of tennis, which, you know, some coaches may have wanted to do seeing as that was the first kind of 10 days, two weeks we really got to spend together to work on things. But, you know, the priority was to get physically strong. You know, she's bought into that, as well. She understands that side of the game well. She was physically obviously very strong herself. Yeah. A lot of things made me and us come to a decision.	6306_7.a	2014-08-13	M	6306	Joao Sousa	Andy Murray	Can you talk about Amlie? You had a test period and now you're sticking with it. What did you see in her that seemed like she was the right person to bring you whatever you're looking for?	6306_7.q	9.0	1	2nd Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN OPEN	Masters 1000
6306_8	Yeah, I have only done it once, but the guys I work with do it quite often. Normally run back from the courts to the apartment. That's what I did, anyway. But it's 6.7 miles. I think when I did it and it was like 47 minutes.	6306_8.a	2014-08-13	M	6306	Joao Sousa	Andy Murray	Speaking of Miami this may seem like a silly question, but we have all seen the commercial; they show it a lot down there anyway. Have you physically run from your apartment from Key Biscayne to the courts?	6306_8.q	9.0	1	2nd Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN OPEN	Masters 1000
6306_9	Yeah.	6306_9.a	2014-08-13	M	6306	Joao Sousa	Andy Murray	Impressive.	6306_9.q	9.0	1	2nd Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN OPEN	Masters 1000
6306_10	I will definitely do a marathon at some stage, but not when I'm playing. That's an amazing effort she's doing that while she's playing, because it takes a lot of training, a lot of hard work for that. I'm assuming she will probably want to get a good time as well. She's pretty competitive. She'll have to train hard.	6306_10.a	2014-08-13	M	6306	Joao Sousa	Andy Murray	Maybe you'll join Wozniacki in New York Marathon.	6306_10.q	9.0	1	2nd Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN OPEN	Masters 1000
6306_11	Well, I had been dealing with it for about two years, so I kind of tried everything. Having surgery I think for athletes normally is a last resort. You try to find different ways of treating problems. Some things would help for the bit of time, but, you know, it would always sort of come back to being in pain. I didn't want to be in pain anymore, so it wasn't actually a difficult decision. I think sometimes with athletes it can be hard if they do something on the court one day and, you know, hurt their knee or their ankle and they have to have surgery the next day and there's no option. That can be quite hard. But I dealt with it fairly well because it was a decision I wanted to make. Like I wanted to have the surgery to make myself better. That's why I did it.	6306_11.a	2014-08-13	M	6306	Joao Sousa	Andy Murray	Before you had the back surgery, was there ever an option you could somehow do physical therapy? Was that a difficult decision to actually go ahead with the surgery, or was it just obvious it had to be done?	6306_11.q	9.0	1	2nd Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN OPEN	Masters 1000
6306_12	Yeah, I guess you could say that, yeah. I mean, yeah.	6306_12.a	2014-08-13	M	6306	Joao Sousa	Andy Murray	Was it essentially a wearandtear kind of injury they thought, or was there something that...	6306_12.q	9.0	1	2nd Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN OPEN	Masters 1000
6306_13	Yeah, I think if I was coming to watch as a fan, coming like to the Wednesday of a Masters Series, especially a combined one, yeah, is pretty much the best ticket you can get really. You know, if I could buy one ticket, I would probably want to go and watch a slam final. But, you know, if you want to see all of the players, you can watch them practice, you can see obviously the men and the women here. Yeah, it's a pretty good ticket.	6306_13.a	2014-08-13	M	6306	Joao Sousa	Andy Murray	It's a soldout crowd here today and a lot of people are talking about what a great lineup it is. Do these Masters 1000s feel different than the slams? It's a smaller event, but the fans still get to see sort of a blockbuster lineup all day.	6306_13.q	9.0	1	2nd Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN OPEN	Masters 1000
6306_14	I don't know how much they are. (Laughter.) I'd think about it, though.	6306_14.a	2014-08-13	M	6306	Joao Sousa	Andy Murray	You'd buy one of those tickets?	6306_14.q	9.0	1	2nd Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN OPEN	Masters 1000
1186_0	Yeah.	1186_0.a	2007-06-27	M	1186	nan	Andy Roddick	In the past you've talked to us about working on, improving various areas of your game, your backhand, return, volleying.	1186_0.q	3.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1186_1	No, I mean, I'm not a finished product.  But, you know, getting there. You know, I think you're always kind of looking to improve.	1186_1.a	2007-06-27	M	1186	nan	Andy Roddick	Do you feel like it's still a work in progress or more like a finished product at this point?	1186_1.q	3.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1186_2	You know, I don't know if you choose the middle of Wimbledon to start working on something.  I think it's been kind of -- been a common sentiment since we got together to get forward a little bit more, drive the ball a little bit more.  You know, it's an ongoing process.	1186_2.a	2007-06-27	M	1186	nan	Andy Roddick	Is there some specific area you've been working on lately, something you feel needs improvement at this point?	1186_2.q	3.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1186_3	At times.  At times.  It was kind of an up-and-down match, even the way I played.  Mentally I was a little bit up and down.  You know, got through it.	1186_3.a	2007-06-27	M	1186	nan	Andy Roddick	You seemed to be enjoying yourself out there today.	1186_3.q	3.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1186_4	I don't know what that was.	1186_4.a	2007-06-27	M	1186	nan	Andy Roddick	Have you heard many noises like that from an umpire before?	1186_4.q	3.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1186_5	Sure it was his microphone.  It was barking frogs.	1186_5.a	2007-06-27	M	1186	nan	Andy Roddick	His microphone.	1186_5.q	3.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1186_6	I mean, technically, I don't know if you're sitting here in the middle of a tournament and you're worrying about your technique.  You're not worrying about like following through and stuff like that. I think you're more worried about how you're going to develop points, you know, how you're going to win points.  So I'd say a lot more of it has to do with confidence and just kind of trying to survive in advance. I don't think a lot about technique during a tournament.  There's kind of a time and a place for that.	1186_6.a	2007-06-27	M	1186	nan	Andy Roddick	As you play, how much of it is the technical side and how much, as you win, is getting the confidence to go on to the next round in a Grand Slam tournament?	1186_6.q	3.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1186_7	Sure.  I mean, I came into the tournament pretty confident, so that was a good thing.  You know, just the thing is, just give yourself another opportunity to play another day.  That's kind of how you get deep into a draw in a Slam.	1186_7.a	2007-06-27	M	1186	nan	Andy Roddick	Does each win add to the confidence?	1186_7.q	3.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1186_8	It's not really a problem.  I had a bad game in the second set of a match against Cilic at Queen's and played a tournament full of concentration where I was winning tough matches. Today I probably had a bad two-game stretch.  I don't know if two bad games in the stretch of three weeks is necessarily a problem. But it's something that you don't get away with later on in tournaments.	1186_8.a	2007-06-27	M	1186	nan	Andy Roddick	You were talking last week a little bit about concentration was a thing you were working on.  Are you better in your mind at that?  Have you erased that problem?	1186_8.q	3.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1186_9	It's tough to say today just because you know it's different than the conditions you're used to because it's cold.  It's kind of inconsistent winds.  It's blowing one minute, it's not, and then it's blowing kind of hard, and then it switches directions.  It's a little bit unpredictable.  I don't know if I would be the best to get a true read on how it's playing considering the other variables.	1186_9.a	2007-06-27	M	1186	nan	Andy Roddick	Everyone has been talking about the quality of the grass out there on Centre, I think because it's open now, the grass in even better nick than it has been in years gone by.  Do you sense that as well?	1186_9.q	3.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1186_10	I think for every person -- I don't know if I can analyze closed, open, all that stuff.  I think for every person you find that's going to say it's open, the wind is going to get there, you're going to find someone who says, Well, when there's a roof it's going to swirl, something like that. I don't know, windy is windy.  Not windy is not windy.  You know, you're probably smarter than I am.  You can go into the cause and effect of it.	1186_10.a	2007-06-27	M	1186	nan	Andy Roddick	Because it is more open and the wind is going to be a factor, do you sense it's going to be a trickier championship to win in those terms?  Because it's going to be like this the next few days as well.	1186_10.q	3.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1186_11	Is it more?	1186_11.a	2007-06-27	M	1186	nan	Andy Roddick	Do you feel like The Championships were more open to clay-courters or baseliners, Rafael Nadal, for example?  If so, what is the reason?	1186_11.q	3.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1186_12	Yeah, sure.  I think you'd find that it's pretty common sentiment that over the last 10 years this tournament has slowed down and you're getting a truer balance.  I think, therefore, you give -- it opens the chance up to a lot more different styles of play.	1186_12.a	2007-06-27	M	1186	nan	Andy Roddick	Open.	1186_12.q	3.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1186_13	You're asking me if he has a chance to win this tournament?	1186_13.a	2007-06-27	M	1186	nan	Andy Roddick	There's a real chance for Nadal to win, for the others?	1186_13.q	3.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1186_14	Yeah, sure.  I mean, he's proven he can play big matches.  He's been to a final here.  I don't know if you'll find someone who says he has no chance.	1186_14.a	2007-06-27	M	1186	nan	Andy Roddick	Real chance.	1186_14.q	3.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1186_15	Well, I think a lot of it's -- if it's worn, I think the more it gets worn in it becomes less soft and the ball starts shooting a bit more.  I think earlier on you find it's a little bit spongy, maybe starts checking a little bit. But if it's a normal grass court and the conditions are right, it's still quick enough.	1186_15.a	2007-06-27	M	1186	nan	Andy Roddick	As a player I'm sure you like the truer bounce.  Is there anything lost in having some of that quirkiness taken out of the surface?	1186_15.q	3.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1186_16	What about them?  Sorry.	1186_16.a	2007-06-27	M	1186	nan	Andy Roddick	I'm talking about funny bounces.	1186_16.q	3.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1186_17	I think the way I feel, I feel like I'm one of the best grass court players.  I'd like to take away as many of the equalizers as possible.  I think that would work against me in this tournament.	1186_17.a	2007-06-27	M	1186	nan	Andy Roddick	If the condition is so even, the condition of the court, you miss the bounces?	1186_17.q	3.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1186_18	It was fun.  I had seen the show before.  I had heard his kind of reputation.  I knew that I had to come out aggressive.  I was able to take that mindset to the stage, really follow through on the game plan (smiling).	1186_18.a	2007-06-27	M	1186	nan	Andy Roddick	You've been in London for a few weeks.  You appeared on the Jonathan Ross show.  Not too many tennis players do.  Can you tell us how you enjoyed it, how you found the evening?	1186_18.q	3.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1186_19	To be honest, I'm as informed as you are.  I glanced at it this morning in the paper probably the same as you did. Obviously, I mean, if that's the case, that's what's going on, that's really disappointing 'cause the locker room is a place where you feel like you can leave your stuff and not have to worry about it.  If it's happening, that's pretty disappointing.	1186_19.a	2007-06-27	M	1186	nan	Andy Roddick	Jonas Bjorkman has spoken today about a quite serious issue, about how a few things have been disappearing from the player locker room.  Your thoughts on whether you've had anything stolen, how unusual it must be in this environment for things to disappear?	1186_19.q	3.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1186_20	Yeah, probably all of those emotions kind of jumbled together.  You know, as an American, we wake up, and I remember my family, we'd make time, we'd have Breakfast at Wimbledon every weekend.  My mom would cook.  We'd all get up before we probably should have, get ready for the tennis, kind of do it as a family.  To be playing in it was surreal. Now it's to the point where my mom just gets up and cooks for my dad.  It's an easier work load now that I'm over here playing.	1186_20.a	2007-06-27	M	1186	nan	Andy Roddick	This is a very special tournament for you.  Can you tell us how you feel the first time you played here?  Were you nervous, excited?  How was it?	1186_20.q	3.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1186_21	I mean, there's no question about his talent, kind of what he's capable of.  We've played many times.  Never on grass.  I don't know if there are going to be a lot of secrets out there.	1186_21.a	2007-06-27	M	1186	nan	Andy Roddick	How do you feel about Fernando Verdasco in case you have to play him?	1186_21.q	3.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1186_22	The funniest thing that I saw that was great this morning when I woke up was they televised the moving van literally pulling up, and they followed the moving van down the street when he's moving his crap out.  I think that's hilarious.  We need to get a moving van in the States somewhere.  That would be hilarious.  I think it's pretty funny. But, you know, on a serious note, I don't really talk to -- I'm not going to pretend too much to know about the political views of Gordon Brown.  I think I'd be on the verge of ignorance if I touched on that any more.  But I'm a big fan of the televising of the moving van.	1186_22.a	2007-06-27	M	1186	nan	Andy Roddick	It's a big day for the Brits today.  How do you feel about Gordon Brown taking over?	1186_22.q	3.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1186_23	That's probably written by someone who didn't bother to make the trip over, correct?	1186_23.a	2007-06-27	M	1186	nan	Andy Roddick	You mentioned watching Wimbledon as a kid, the ritual.  As usual there were articles in the paper about how Wimbledon doesn't have the edge that it used to.	1186_23.q	3.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1186_24	Then we don't need to touch on that anymore, do we?	1186_24.a	2007-06-27	M	1186	nan	Andy Roddick	You are absolutely correct.	1186_24.q	3.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1186_25	I don't know.  It's tough to say.  All you hear is, and pretty much this is the case with every sport, you always hear about how past generations were the greatest.  It's almost like we should appreciate what we have before we have to look back and remember how much we miss it. America's tough just because it's so big, it's so spread out.  We don't have the training center that everybody goes to.  It's a different culture with kids not wanting to give up their high school experience.  It's tough. But I think they're doing a better job of getting past people who have experienced, who are in the tennis, kind of developing the talent now, past players.  I think that's good. I think the move to Boca will be a good thing, having on-site living so people aren't paying out-of-pocket like they would in Key Biscayne.  For a touring pro to stay in Key Biscayne during a training week, it's not easy.  I think that's a good thing. I think they're moving in the right direction.  I think they just need to utilize people who have kind of been there and who want to try to help.	1186_25.a	2007-06-27	M	1186	nan	Andy Roddick	If there were one or two ways you could improve tennis in America, not saying it's good or bad now, but to make it even more dynamic, what would that be?	1186_25.q	3.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1186_26	I think the obvious question to that is, any capacity you can get Andre Agassi giving advice on tennis will help America.  But at the same time his priority is going to be his family.  There's only so much of him to go around. I think he's earned the right to kind of dedicate himself to whatever he wants for a little while.	1186_26.a	2007-06-27	M	1186	nan	Andy Roddick	Would you like to see Andre having a more direct role in terms of player development in America?	1186_26.q	3.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1186_27	"The thing about the popularity and stuff, you know, we're going bigger stadiums, you're still selling out in a lot of places that we go to.  I think the biggest thing is just, you know, and I've said it ad nauseam for some of the people in here, you're kind of getting over the best generation ever from one country.  Before that you probably had the second best generation.  It's cyclical. But to sit here and say there's something wrong with it when, like you said, with the exception of Fed, Nadal, who else is winning Slams right now?  Outside of Fed, who else is winning Slams on any other surface?  So it's all relative. We continually kind of have guys pushing at the top.  I think James had a good year last year.  The reemergence of Venus and Serena is a good thing.  You look at the ratings for the US Open last year, we're up.  It depends on how you want to define ""popularity"" I think."	1186_27.a	2007-06-27	M	1186	nan	Andy Roddick	Did you catch any of James' comments yesterday?  He was a bit defensive about American tennis with you and he in the top 10, two guys in the top 10, is doing pretty well, and the Bryan Twins, et cetera.  We got into how do you make tennis more popular in the United States.	1186_27.q	3.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
298_0	Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, bestofthree in a quick court sometimes you just can run away with the score, so that's where maybe a bad five to ten minutes can cost you the match. I think it was close in that first set. I think we were both, you know, trying to find our range. I'm happy I didn't start to play too careful after it, because it is tough to play here in Dubai with the quick conditions. After that, I think I started to return much better. Serve got a bit more consistent. My halfvolleys were getting better. I was able to get the set and the break, and then that's when you can bring it home. He's been struggling as of late a little bit. I don't think he's gotten the best draws, either, so he's missing matches. I think I was able to take advantage of that a bit.	298_0.a	2015-02-23	M	298	Mikhail Youzhny	Roger Federer	That was potentially a difficult match. He's had some good results here.	298_0.q	2.0	1	1st Round	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP500
298_1	A bit of both. I mean, the last thing I want to do is lose backtoback matches playing careful. I know I can play careful tennis, but then you cannot leave it up to the other guys sometimes if you are going to win or lose. I feel over the years I have won my biggest matches in most tournaments by playing on my terms, and you can't always do it. It's difficult to come out and dominate every match, every point, and it's also hard work always playing aggressive. So sometimes it's nice to wait at times and not force it upon the other guy all the time, but I still do believe here in Dubai, if you want to do well, you have to play on top of the baseline, accept that you're going to play a lot of halfvolleys, and, if possible for me, I think I'm going to try to come to the net a bit.	298_1.a	2015-02-23	M	298	Mikhail Youzhny	Roger Federer	Your decision not to play too carefully, was that related to the conditions here, the wind, or what happened in Australia?	298_1.q	2.0	1	1st Round	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP500
298_2	I'm not sure. You should know better than I do. But yeah, I mean, as far as I remember, it's usually 80% full, I'd say, depending on what time of the day you play and what has gone on during that day. But I'm lucky enough to be put on prime time most of the time so people come out and watch me play often. I do appreciate that, because I must say it's much easier getting excited and motivated for matches like this than being put on court 3, you know, at 12:00 during the daytime when there is nobody going to come out because everybody's working. So I appreciate that, and it's definitely keeping me on the tour longer. There's not a doubt about that.	298_2.a	2015-02-23	M	298	Mikhail Youzhny	Roger Federer	This is the first time there were fans in the upper grandstands since the beginning of the women's week. Do you get full houses in first rounds everywhere you go, or is it special?	298_2.q	2.0	1	1st Round	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP500
298_3	You see, that's okay. That's okay.	298_3.a	2015-02-23	M	298	Mikhail Youzhny	Roger Federer	Talking about playing on court 3, tomorrow you're on Court 1.	298_3.q	2.0	1	1st Round	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP500
298_4	I hope so. I don't know. When I do play doubles, I'm excited about it. Michael Lammer is one of the guys, some of my best friends, was one of best friends on tour and in my life, and he's a guy I have never played doubles with. So I really want to do that before he retires because he's not far off. And we won the Davis Cup last year. I have played doubles with Marco, with Yves, with Stan, with most of those guys but never with Michael other than back in the Junior Swiss Championships when we were 14, 16, 18. So we go way back. That's why we are both excited about it, and I'm very thankful for the wildcard from the tournament organizers.	298_4.a	2015-02-23	M	298	Mikhail Youzhny	Roger Federer	I imagine there will be a big crowd for that.	298_4.q	2.0	1	1st Round	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP500
298_5	A bit of both, you know. I like being on the beach. I like being in the gym and on the practice courts and I like being on the match courts. I like everything of it. I think it's important to get the right mix of things. I was going to take a big break regardless of how actually Australia was going to go because the body needed some healing and the mind needed some refreshing. I needed to think about the game plan and the tournament plan I was going to do in the next few months and next year or so. I mean, pretty much I know everything till, Jesus, summer of '16. So from that standpoint, it was good to have that break. It wasn't a buildup as such where the focus was only on fitness. It was important to play enough tennis, and it's nice getting back out there and having thousands root for you and for your opponent, because you can only practice that much after a while without anybody watching you. It just gets a bit boring after a while. So I prefer to play matches after all.	298_5.a	2015-02-23	M	298	Mikhail Youzhny	Roger Federer	When you have had a little bit more of an extended break than maybe you had planned on or hoped, when you get back there, do you feel like it's great to be here again? Have you missed the actual matches?	298_5.q	2.0	1	1st Round	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP500
298_6	No, it wasn't a difficult decision. I have played for so long, and I think by winning it I can finally do whatever I please, to be quite honest. It's been a big burden for me throughout my career and one of the things that have caused more difficulties in my life than many other things, I must say, because I always feel there is so much guilt put on you from the Federation or from the ITF more so than anybody else. So I'm happy I was able to finally tick that off and do it altogether. I mean, I didn't do it just for that. I totally did it for the boys more than for me, to be quite honest. I just really wanted Michael and Marco and Stan to get it because they deserve it. So for me this year it was very clear that I was not going to play anymore after this win, but I have to see how things go. I hope that Stan is going to play, you know, next round or September or whatever it's going to be to keep us in the World Group. Who knows? You never know if they can win it without us, as well. It's an opportunity, but clearly we are not the favorites now playing against Belgium. But I'm sorry for the team because the team is pretty much intact from the staff and from captain and everybody. They are all some of my best friends, so that was the tougher part of it, less the tennis itself.	298_6.a	2015-02-23	M	298	Mikhail Youzhny	Roger Federer	Davis Cup, you mentioned just now, was it a difficult decision not to defend the title by playing the first round? What do you think the chances are of staying in the World Group? Will you play in September?	298_6.q	2.0	1	1st Round	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP500
298_7	No, I said I didn't I didn't say that. I don't think I can, actually, as you know. It's always those silly things.	298_7.a	2015-02-23	M	298	Mikhail Youzhny	Roger Federer	So just to be correct, you have now retired from Davis Cup?	298_7.q	2.0	1	1st Round	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP500
1784_0	Yeah, not just on grass. Yeah, I mean, for me, my serve, especially my first serve, is one of the best parts of my game, you know, winning over 80% of the points when it's going in. Obviously served a lot of aces today, as well. Yeah, something that I've worked on a lot and is helping me out in the matches.	1784_0.a	2008-06-26	M	1784	Xavier Malisse	Andy Murray	Xavier came in saying how impressed he was with your serve. Do you feel it's really evolving as a real weapon on grass?	1784_0.q	11.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1784_1	I'm not quite hitting it his speed yet. But, no, I mean, it's getting there. You know, hopefully the next couple years it will get a bit stronger, you know, get the strength in my shoulder to maintain it over five sets so that, you know, I can keep it going for, you know, the whole way through tournaments. You know, right now I've never had to play sort of six, seven matches in a row. But, uhm, yeah, it's working well so far.	1784_1.a	2008-06-26	M	1784	Xavier Malisse	Andy Murray	16 aces, 136 miles an hour. Looks like Andy Roddick, never mind Andy Murray.	1784_1.q	11.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1784_2	Well, I mean, he's really a tough player. You know, he's solid off both sides. Serves well. Volleys good. You know, moves good. You know, he doesn't have too many weaknesses. That's obviously going to be tricky. But, you know, if I serve like I did my first couple of matches, you know, and put as many returns in the court as I did, then I'm going to have chances to break serve, put a lot of pressure on him. But it's going to be a difficult match, no question.	1784_2.a	2008-06-26	M	1784	Xavier Malisse	Andy Murray	What different threat does Tommy Haas present?	1784_2.q	11.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1784_3	Yeah, I didn't play particularly well after the first set in that match. I lost my concentration a bit early on in the second. But, yeah, I played him twice in Indian Wells, both long three-set matches. I mean, yeah, he played well that day. You know, against someone that's as solid as him you've got to stay focused the whole match, and that's going to be one of the keys.	1784_3.a	2008-06-26	M	1784	Xavier Malisse	Andy Murray	What do you remember when he beat you in Indian Wells this year?	1784_3.q	11.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1784_4	Yeah, you know, I don't think he played his best match today. But there were stages in the match where he can hit some great shots, and you have to make sure you don't let him get back in the really important game at 3-2 in the third set. You know, we had some breakpoints. He had some good passing shots. You need to make sure that you don't let someone that is sort of streaky get into a match like that and take a lot of confidence from managing to keep my cool and serve big in the important moments. I feel very confident winning two matches in straight sets. Can't start much better.	1784_4.a	2008-06-26	M	1784	Xavier Malisse	Andy Murray	How much confidence can you take from beating sort of a decent player quite so comprehensively in the second round of a slam?	1784_4.q	11.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1784_5	After a match point? Well, I mean, the umpire kind of messed up a little bit. He thought that Xavier was saying that he didn't -- sorry, he wasn't ready to return, so therefore was putting his hand up to say, I'm not ready, sorry. And, you know, me and him obviously knew that he was challenging me. Me and Xavier knew he was calling the call. The umpire didn't quite understand what was going on. Yeah, he told him what happened. But, yeah, that's probably the first time I had to play football. I had no idea what was going on. It seemed like it was so long I was just waiting on the court for.	1784_5.a	2008-06-26	M	1784	Xavier Malisse	Andy Murray	Have you ever played football after a match point?	1784_5.q	11.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1784_6	I don't really have a record. I do a few little skills to trapping up my shoulder, behind my neck, catching it in my pocket. I don't really go further than that.	1784_6.a	2008-06-26	M	1784	Xavier Malisse	Andy Murray	What is your keepy-uppy record, Andy?	1784_6.q	11.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1784_7	I mean, the conditions for me, I probably feel like it watching, but it was quite swirly, the wind on the court. Therefore, I miss-hit a couple of groundstrokes that I might not normally miss-hit. I mean, I thought, yeah, so far it's been good. Serve's good. Return's good. Moving well. You know, the more matches you play you're going to get more confidence in all of your shots. Yeah, it's been good so far.	1784_7.a	2008-06-26	M	1784	Xavier Malisse	Andy Murray	After two games, is your game where you want it to be? It looks very positive. Is there anything that you're a little bit concerned about? Was everything pretty much what you'd expect at that stage?	1784_7.q	11.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1784_8	No, I felt good on the court. You know, before the matches, you know, you get the butterflies and the excitement. But, like I said, when you actually get out on the court, play the first few games, I've obviously started both matches well, got early breaks. You know, that obviously helps calm you down. Once I got the break in the first set, I obviously didn't let him back into the match.	1784_8.a	2008-06-26	M	1784	Xavier Malisse	Andy Murray	You look incredibly relaxed. Haven't seemed stressed at any stage, unless I'm misreading it.	1784_8.q	11.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1784_9	The day before my first match I actually got locked out of my apartment, had no keys to get in. Struggled to get back that day. But apart from that, yeah, it's been fine.	1784_9.a	2008-06-26	M	1784	Xavier Malisse	Andy Murray	When you've been leaving Wimbledon in the evenings, are you finding it easy to switch off?	1784_9.q	11.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1784_10	I didn't lose keys. My girlfriend took a set, and my friend. I think he was over there. I don't know where he's gone now. He took a set. Yeah, they were both -- they weren't at the tennis. They were in central London. So, yeah, I had no keys to get in.	1784_10.a	2008-06-26	M	1784	Xavier Malisse	Andy Murray	What was the reason for that? Obviously you lost your keys, but why?	1784_10.q	11.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1784_11	I kind of read the situation early and I decided to stay here and I made a couple of calls. I was here for probably about an hour and a half extra than I would have liked to have been.	1784_11.a	2008-06-26	M	1784	Xavier Malisse	Andy Murray	How long did you get stuck out there for?	1784_11.q	11.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1784_12	The cap?	1784_12.a	2008-06-26	M	1784	Xavier Malisse	Andy Murray	You were wearing the cap. I have to ask. Is the cap still around?	1784_12.q	11.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1784_13	I don't remember wearing a Scottish cap.	1784_13.a	2008-06-26	M	1784	Xavier Malisse	Andy Murray	The Scottish cap.	1784_13.q	11.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1784_14	What was the question?	1784_14.a	2008-06-26	M	1784	Xavier Malisse	Andy Murray	White stripe on it.	1784_14.q	11.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1784_15	Like I said, I obviously get my clothes from Fred Perry. I don't make the clothes. If they give me any cap... The ones I have in my bag are the plain white ones with no design, the same color. Looks like there's kind of a cross on it. I don't think it was a Scottish thing.	1784_15.a	2008-06-26	M	1784	Xavier Malisse	Andy Murray	I've lost track myself. Is the hat in a bag somewhere? Is it a lucky thing?	1784_15.q	11.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1784_16	Yeah. I mean, to win your first two matches in straight sets, you know, is obviously what you want to do. There's a couple of things I could have done. Neither of the matches were completely perfect. There were some things I could have done a bit better. I mean, for the start of a slam, to be through pretty comfortably is what you want to do. You know, I've not used up too much energy. You know, I'll be fresh for my next match.	1784_16.a	2008-06-26	M	1784	Xavier Malisse	Andy Murray	Would you say it's been a perfect start to Wimbledon for you?	1784_16.q	11.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1784_17	Maggie.	1784_17.a	2008-06-26	M	1784	Xavier Malisse	Andy Murray	You said you take your dog out for a walk. What is the dog's name?	1784_17.q	11.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1784_18	12 weeks.	1784_18.a	2008-06-26	M	1784	Xavier Malisse	Andy Murray	How old is she?	1784_18.q	11.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1784_19	No, I didn't get the dog just for that (smiling). I've always loved dogs, but never really had the chance to sort of have my own one. Now I'm in a position where I'm able to do that. Yeah, I'm enjoying it.	1784_19.a	2008-06-26	M	1784	Xavier Malisse	Andy Murray	Is that just something to relax, take your mind off tennis?	1784_19.q	11.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1784_20	Border terrier. I prefer big dogs, but I couldn't -- a bit hard to sort of take a big dog around with you.	1784_20.a	2008-06-26	M	1784	Xavier Malisse	Andy Murray	What breed is it?	1784_20.q	11.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1784_21	It did a couple years ago 'cause I think that's really when it all sort of started. Obviously Tim and Greg were around, were coming towards the end of their careers. It's almost a good thing I sort of learnt to get used to it when they're still around. Now I'm obviously a bit more used to it, got a bit more experience with everything. This year for me hasn't been that difficult in comparison to previous years.	1784_21.a	2008-06-26	M	1784	Xavier Malisse	Andy Murray	Four or five years ago when nobody knew who you were you would have followed this tournament, seen Tim the center of all the attention. Does it seem funny now for you to be in that role?	1784_21.q	11.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1784_22	It's not so much the expectations, it's more the dealing with the sort of media requirements and obviously a lot of people, you know, wanting different things from you around this time. I've just kind of learnt to sort of say no, I guess. When I first sort of came to Wimbledon and was playing I was agreeing to do everything, kind of tiring myself out that way. I got much more sort of relaxed off the court now, which helps.	1784_22.a	2008-06-26	M	1784	Xavier Malisse	Andy Murray	So you're managing the high expectations better than in previous visits here?	1784_22.q	11.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1784_23	Yeah, it was nice. Obviously the match against Santoro, towards the end of the third set, the atmosphere started to get better and better. I think -- I mean, the crowd support has obviously been very good. I guess it's difficult for them to kind of get really into a match when it's very one-sided. But, yeah, I think it was obviously really nice at the end. I took my time. Obviously played a good game to finish with, so it helped.	1784_23.a	2008-06-26	M	1784	Xavier Malisse	Andy Murray	The crowds have been quite calm until that moment as you started to serve for the final game. Really a moving applause for you. How did that feel?	1784_23.q	11.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1784_24	Definitely, yeah.	1784_24.a	2008-06-26	M	1784	Xavier Malisse	Andy Murray	If you can get back into your apartment tonight, will you watch the Spain-Russia game?	1784_24.q	11.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1784_25	Yeah, I have been. I watched -- I had some money on Germany last night. A little bit tense towards the end of that match. But, yeah, I'll be watching most of the competition.	1784_25.a	2008-06-26	M	1784	Xavier Malisse	Andy Murray	Have you been following the tournament?	1784_25.q	11.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1784_26	I said at the start of the tournament I thought Germany was going to win, so hopefully Germany.	1784_26.a	2008-06-26	M	1784	Xavier Malisse	Andy Murray	Are you shouting for anybody in particular?	1784_26.q	11.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1784_27	Yeah, I bet on myself to win Wimbledon this year (smiling). No, no, I don't think you can.	1784_27.a	2008-06-26	M	1784	Xavier Malisse	Andy Murray	Is a player allowed to back himself in tennis? Can a player have a bet on himself?	1784_27.q	11.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1784_28	I guess you could in theory say to your opponent, Here is 20 grand. Lose the match to me.	1784_28.a	2008-06-26	M	1784	Xavier Malisse	Andy Murray	Seems silly. You're not going to throw a game if you back yourself.	1784_28.q	11.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1784_29	Yeah.	1784_29.a	2008-06-26	M	1784	Xavier Malisse	Andy Murray	So the answer is no?	1784_29.q	11.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1784_30	I don't know if she watches my matches or not. Maggie Mae is one of my favorite songs from Rod Stewart is kind of the reason.	1784_30.a	2008-06-26	M	1784	Xavier Malisse	Andy Murray	Any particular reason for the name Maggie, and does she watch your matches?	1784_30.q	11.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
5668_0	Yeah, that means a lot to win today. Yeah, being she's obviously 18th seed, like you said. I'm outside 100. Haven't been pushing the later stages of Grand Slams for a while. Yeah, it means a lot. I certainly believe that I can win those matches and I've done the work. It's always a matter of going out and executing. Yeah, but I was able to do that today. Yeah, that means a lot. So pretty stoked.	5668_0.a	2014-01-15	F	5668	nan	Casey Dellacqua	That was a big win over the 18th seed. Where does that rank in your victories?	5668_0.q	120.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5668_1	Yeah, probably with where I'm at in my career, you know, it's probably, yeah, up there with one of the best wins. I know she made the fourth round here last year. Yeah, I guess in terms of my career, where I've come, like my second career I kind of call it in a way, it's probably definitely the best career win for me in that sense since my injuries and stuff for sure.	5668_1.a	2014-01-15	F	5668	nan	Casey Dellacqua	Does that rate high in terms of your best wins?	5668_1.q	120.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5668_2	Yeah, I think I just played a really good match today. I had a pretty clear understanding of what I needed to do to win today. I didn't think it would be probably the scoreline it was, but it didn't feel like that out there. It never feels easy. It doesn't matter who you play. But in saying that, I felt like I played great. I served really well. Since I knew I was playing Kirsten, I had practiced a lot of slice with my coach. That's all we did for a couple days. So I was very, very wellprepared. When I walked on court, I knew I had done what I could. But, yeah, again, it's always easy to say that, different to execute, but I was happy that I was able to execute today.	5668_2.a	2014-01-15	F	5668	nan	Casey Dellacqua	What about the dominant nature in the scoreline?	5668_2.q	120.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5668_3	Yeah, I guess in the second set there even at 1Love, I went up 2Love, you know, those are the important games when you win the first set to just kind of knuckle down, try and get on top as quickly as I can. I knew she couldn't hurt me off the backhand side. It was just a matter of me keep going back in there, just be patient and work the point as best I could, try and be aggressive when I had the chance. But, uhm, yeah, it was good.	5668_3.a	2014-01-15	F	5668	nan	Casey Dellacqua	Was there a moment where you knew you had broken her spirit?	5668_3.q	120.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5668_4	Yeah, I feel good. The schedule's worked well for me. I played Monday. It wasn't overly hot. Yesterday I had an early hit, had the whole day to relax. Tomorrow will be great. I'll be able to have a bit of a hit out with Ash out in the doubles. Yeah, that will be fun. I feel good. Who knows how far I can go. I know it's clich, but you do take it one match at a time. For me, I look at it as another opportunity, another match for me to do really well and work on the things that I've been doing really well at. If that's a win, great. If not, I'll be still really proud of what I've done, just keep working hard. But, yeah, I don't know. Hopefully I can keep going. Body feels good, so...	5668_4.a	2014-01-15	F	5668	nan	Casey Dellacqua	How far can you go? How is the body feeling?	5668_4.q	120.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5668_5	Yeah, I do. But I thought Friday is cooler.	5668_5.a	2014-01-15	F	5668	nan	Casey Dellacqua	You say you like playing in the heat. Are you seriously telling us you're looking forward to playing on Friday?	5668_5.q	120.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5668_6	Oh, okay (smiling). Well, today I honestly didn't feel like it was that bad. Hisense, once the shadow came over, it was pretty covered. I didn't think the sun was beaming on us. I think today was pretty perfect conditions, to be honest. It was a little bit humid. I've certainly played in worse conditions around the world. Yeah, I don't mind it. My body feels great when it's warm. I really struggle a bit more probably in cooler conditions just to get the body going. I don't mind the heat. Obviously there's a point where you have to be sensible. If it gets too hot, it is dangerous. Today it was fine out there.	5668_6.a	2014-01-15	F	5668	nan	Casey Dellacqua	No.	5668_6.q	120.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5668_7	Yeah, that's probably quite dangerous, I would think (laughter). If it gets to that point, the sun's beaming down, there's so many different factors we've all heard. There's a lot of discretion in what is not. Certainly if the sun's beaming, it's pretty warm temperatures. If it's 44, yeah, I wouldn't mind, but I don't know.	5668_7.a	2014-01-15	F	5668	nan	Casey Dellacqua	What point is that? It's going to be 44 tomorrow.	5668_7.q	120.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5668_8	I actually feel like I'm playing better, to be honest with you. In terms of how I'm hitting the ball, physically I'm feeling a lot better out on the court, moving a lot better. In that respect definitely better. Hitting the ball probably better. Yeah, probably better in this part of my career. Also, you know, maturity, growing up, getting through those tough years. All that happens. Everyone's got their journey. For me, that was that career. Then I had a couple of surgeries. The last couple years I worked hard to get back. Yeah, I certainly do feel like I'm playing some of the best tennis I ever played before, so it feels good.	5668_8.a	2014-01-15	F	5668	nan	Casey Dellacqua	Do you feel like you're playing as well as your first career?	5668_8.q	120.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5668_9	That was all a blur for me. I don't know how to explain it. I feel like now I'm a bit more in control of my emotions, maybe what's going on, understanding why I'm winning matches, where I'm at. I'm really excited. But, yeah, I also look forward to another opportunity to play and to win the next round. I think you're such a different person when you're 22 to when you're 28. Yeah, I mean, I know I've beaten a quality opponent now. I do believe I can continue to beat players like that. If it's here at the Australian Open, that would be great. But I'll definitely be having a good crack on Friday to continue this run here and hopefully keep that going.	5668_9.a	2014-01-15	F	5668	nan	Casey Dellacqua	You beat two top20 players in 2008. Do you feel that same kind of adrenaline kicking in?	5668_9.q	120.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5668_10	Yeah, awesome. Can tick that goal off. That was my goal, to be top 100. I can set my year a bit more, plan my year a bit more, knowing I'll be in the French Open, Wimbledon off my own ranking. You can schedule around the Grand Slams. That was my first goal. I'll probably sit down with my coach Stinger and set some other goals to achieve. But I'm not finished here at the Australian Open yet. I'm obviously excited to play again on Friday. Have doubles with Ash. Have mixed as well. I've still got a lot of tennis ahead of me. I'm really stoked with how things are going so far.	5668_10.a	2014-01-15	F	5668	nan	Casey Dellacqua	You said you want to get in the top 100. You'll be in the top 100 win or lose. That's a goal?	5668_10.q	120.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5668_11	Yeah, I think, you know, I certainly have belief that I can beat those players that I've beaten so far, the two girls that I have just beaten. Yeah, so, you know, I don't know if I've exceeded my expectations, but I certainly feel like I've given myself every opportunity to win. That's what I've been able to do. Yeah, I'm really excited. I guess I'm just really proud that I've put the work in, the hard work's paying off. Hopefully that will continue, yeah, get another win on Friday. But, yeah, we'll see.	5668_11.a	2014-01-15	F	5668	nan	Casey Dellacqua	Heading into your thirdround clash, would you say you exceeded your expectations of your running in this tournament?	5668_11.q	120.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5668_12	I know it's the winner of Madison Keys and Jie Zheng. I played Madison here last year. I know quite a bit about Madison. I know quite a bit about Jie Zheng. Whoever wins that match, they're two different players. It will be tough. Every match at the Australian Open is tough. Doesn't matter who it is, where it is. I love playing here in Australia. The crowd out there today were awesome. Hisense Arena for me was awesome. The crowd really got behind me. I love that. Hopefully that works in my favor on Friday, as well.	5668_12.a	2014-01-15	F	5668	nan	Casey Dellacqua	Have you looked ahead of Friday?	5668_12.q	120.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
250_0	I absolutely do want to play and I'll do everything I can to be ready to play. I want to be as close to 100% as possible. So that's my goal.	250_0.a	2015-10-03	F	250	Garbine Muguruza	Venus Williams	When you say you're still focused and want to play, think about the next match, do you really think you'll be able to play next week in Beijing?	250_0.q	24.0	1	The Final	DONGFENG MOTOR WUHAN OPEN	Premier
250_1	By the time I'm on the court, I've blocked it out if I've decided I'm going to play. At that point I'm in the match and not anywhere else. But of course there's doubt before you walk on the court. Just try to do as much as you can to get to the point where you're not thinking about it.	250_1.a	2015-10-03	F	250	Garbine Muguruza	Venus Williams	Is it easy when you're playing a match not to be thinking, Okay, maybe I'm hurting myself really badly, or is it easy to block this out?	250_1.q	24.0	1	The Final	DONGFENG MOTOR WUHAN OPEN	Premier
250_2	Yeah, uhm, I think just getting the break at 42, I felt like I started to feel more rhythm for her game. I had a breakpoint that I lost. But after that I felt like I'm starting to understand her game a little bit more. We haven't played in close to a couple years now. She's really improved since that time. So just to get a feel for what she's doing, that always helped. So I felt at that moment to find some rhythm.	250_2.a	2015-10-03	F	250	Garbine Muguruza	Venus Williams	I'm wondering if there was a moment maybe early in the first set where obviously there's stress in the back of your mind physically whether or not you can play at your best, but maybe a missed shot from her or a point she played and didn't play the way she wanted that gave you kind of confidence?	250_2.q	24.0	1	The Final	DONGFENG MOTOR WUHAN OPEN	Premier
250_3	I don't know (laughter). I was just so focused to do my best to win the games. There were some breaks which, of course, aren't ideal. I like to hold serve as much as possible. So that always feels, like when I'm not holding serve, I'm not at my best. I feel that's what I want to do when I walk on the court, is hold serve. But I guess just being better on the important points.	250_3.a	2015-10-03	F	250	Garbine Muguruza	Venus Williams	In between the lines, what were you particularly pleased with with how you were able to execute today?	250_3.q	24.0	1	The Final	DONGFENG MOTOR WUHAN OPEN	Premier
250_4	Well, I feel like everyone else on tour: I work hard, I give my best. As long as you continue to work and believe in yourself, you're going to have results. That's exactly what I've done. It's never been the easiest road, but it doesn't mean that it's not a road worth traveling.	250_4.a	2015-10-03	F	250	Garbine Muguruza	Venus Williams	This is your biggest title since Dubai back in 2010. What does that mean for you? What do you think it means about this part of your career?	250_4.q	24.0	1	The Final	DONGFENG MOTOR WUHAN OPEN	Premier
250_5	Really?	250_5.a	2015-10-03	F	250	Garbine Muguruza	Venus Williams	With this result, you'll be top 8 in the Road to Singapore.	250_5.q	24.0	1	The Final	DONGFENG MOTOR WUHAN OPEN	Premier
250_6	I haven't been counting points.	250_6.a	2015-10-03	F	250	Garbine Muguruza	Venus Williams	Yeah. So Singapore is a possibility. Sounds like you're shocked by that. What would it mean to potentially be able to qualify?	250_6.q	24.0	1	The Final	DONGFENG MOTOR WUHAN OPEN	Premier
250_7	Yes. It's easier to count points when you're not playing. I don't know. I'll just keep trying to play, try to be healthy, try to hold serve. I had some off days serving this week. It's hard when you're playing backtobacktobacktoback. You don't get a chance to go to the court and practice and find the rhythm again. So I'm hoping to rest, try to get my leg 100%, then have a chance to also practice. As long as I'm serving big, it makes my life so much easier. So just try to get back on the rhythm for that and feel healthy, and I probably have a good chance. I mean, wow.	250_7.a	2015-10-03	F	250	Garbine Muguruza	Venus Williams	That's our job.	250_7.q	24.0	1	The Final	DONGFENG MOTOR WUHAN OPEN	Premier
250_8	Of course. It's been such tough draws for me this year. Every major on the same side. Every tournament we played together, except a couple, same side of the draw. You would think the odds would put you on the other side at that point. It's hard when you see sometimes the other side of the draw there's nothing happening. Those are opportunities for other players that they've really capitalized on, been able to improve their game. Feel happy for them to do that. If I keep improving, it gives us a better chance to be on the other side of the draw. But really had a tough year. It was just bad luck.	250_8.a	2015-10-03	F	250	Garbine Muguruza	Venus Williams	Watching you play this week, just the level you were able to maintain across the tournament, it kind of made a few of us think, Gosh, if only she were on the other side of the draw at Wimbledon or the US Open. Does that ever cross your mind at all?	250_8.q	24.0	1	The Final	DONGFENG MOTOR WUHAN OPEN	Premier
250_9	It's hard when you get used to playing with it, especially in these big tournaments, when the points really matter. A lot of the balls are close. There was one particular shot where the ball was just out, and I didn't get the call. I was serving to stay in the match. That was frustrating because that's when you really need the point. It was mine. That was my point. I earned it. So that one was very frustrating for me. You can't let it undo you. I'm happy I survived that moment.	250_9.a	2015-10-03	F	250	Garbine Muguruza	Venus Williams	We noticed last night eagle eye. Maybe you think that is a missjudge. How do you get into the court without eagle eye?	250_9.q	24.0	1	The Final	DONGFENG MOTOR WUHAN OPEN	Premier
250_10	Really great experience here this year. I had opportunity to see the city, see that it's actually a beautiful city with a lot of people who are very excited about tennis. That will only grow. I had a wonderful experience. I think it may be my favorite city in Asia. Of course, having a great result here helps. It's a good experience. But I've really come to enjoy it here.	250_10.a	2015-10-03	F	250	Garbine Muguruza	Venus Williams	I am one of your fans and also I bring my parents here to Wuhan to watch you play, especially with Radwanska, a very late game, and also a wonderful performance. I want to know will you be here in Wuhan next year and what are your expectations?	250_10.q	24.0	1	The Final	DONGFENG MOTOR WUHAN OPEN	Premier
5624_0	Of course everyone that played a long match in those conditions is going to feel physically and emotionally tired, and that's the way it goes. You just have to find a way to get through it. You know, that's what I did. It was quite tough in the end. She had a set point and she had a chance to level the match out, which is something I probably wouldn't want to do, is go into a third set. I was I was happy I was able to finish it in two.	5624_0.a	2014-01-18	F	5624	Alize Cornet	Maria Sharapova	Can we assume that you were fairly spent after the last match. Was it kind of a little bit tough to get through today?	5624_0.q	3.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5624_1	No, I think it was just a lot more recovery, not so much the preparation for today.	5624_1.a	2014-01-18	F	5624	Alize Cornet	Maria Sharapova	Did you change your normal preparation routine after what happened on Thursday to today, or was it just business as usual in the way you prepared?	5624_1.q	3.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5624_2	I think I can take a few positives from this match. One being the fact that I was able to win it not playing my best tennis. There are definitely things I'm going to have to improve and do better moving forward, because it only is going to get tougher. But, yeah, I am happy that I took my chances, you know, even though it was pretty close in that second set.	5624_2.a	2014-01-18	F	5624	Alize Cornet	Maria Sharapova	Each time you were challenged in the second set you were up a break on her back. You must draw a lot of strength on that on a day when your serve wasn't necessarily firing?	5624_2.q	3.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5624_3	Uhhuh.	5624_3.a	2014-01-18	F	5624	Alize Cornet	Maria Sharapova	You went to practice after the match?	5624_3.q	3.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5624_4	No. I just didn't have a great rhythm. It's sometimes nice just to be able to come off the court and groove, just to get a good hit on the ball. Conditions were a little bit tricky from one end, and, you know, balls were flying a bit. I just wanted to get a good rhythm again.	5624_4.a	2014-01-18	F	5624	Alize Cornet	Maria Sharapova	So basically you wanted to hit more balls? Are you feeling just a little bit lack of match play?	5624_4.q	3.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5624_5	I'm hoping that it is. You know, I still feel like in certain situations I am a bit rusty and I'm not closing it out when I have to or maybe going for a little much or overthinking it a bit. That will come. I'm not worried about that. Those are the as long as I feel like I'm doing the right things and I'm playing the way I want to play, if I'm making those types of errors, they are going to go in eventually.	5624_5.a	2014-01-18	F	5624	Alize Cornet	Maria Sharapova	Back to the match play, I think you have had three matches after Roland Garros last year and now six. Is that enough for you?	5624_5.q	3.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5624_6	Just a lot more ice baths and a lot more like hand treatment and hot and cold baths. Just a lot of things. I was just really working my physio. He had a long evening.	5624_6.a	2014-01-18	F	5624	Alize Cornet	Maria Sharapova	Can you tell us what sort of recovery is different after playing in 40 degree heat? Also, how long did it take you to actually feel normal again?	5624_6.q	3.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5624_7	A little bit. I think it's a combination of both. I think there are a few different times where I think I could have taken control of the match. You know, one of those is in the third game of that second set where, you know, I felt like I was doing the right things, playing solid, you know, moving forward. And then once I lost that game I think my concentration dropped a little bit. Then I got it going again. So there was a few ups and downs, and that's something that I definitely want to eliminate going forward.	5624_7.a	2014-01-18	F	5624	Alize Cornet	Maria Sharapova	You raced to a great start in the first set. Would you say the second set, would you say it was a drop in intensity for you or did she play better?	5624_7.q	3.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5624_8	Everyone seems to think I will be commentating on winter sports. I'm not a bobsledding expert (Laughter.) I will confirm I won't be commentating. I'm going to be showcasing the city of Sochi to a worldwide audience, and we will be doing a few segments. I'm going to be with a few different cohosts around the city, in the village, and then I'm going to be a doing a few segments in the studio with Bob Costas, as well.	5624_8.a	2014-01-18	F	5624	Alize Cornet	Maria Sharapova	The Olympics is coming up real soon. I understand you're going to have a gig as a commentator with NBC. Can you talk about that? Excited about that?	5624_8.q	3.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5624_9	I have discussed the issue a couple of times, and quite recently when I did an interview for The New York Times. I said everything I wanted to say there about it.	5624_9.a	2014-01-18	F	5624	Alize Cornet	Maria Sharapova	There have been those gayrelated laws that have come into play, and Billy Jean, Martina, Blake, god number of people have spoken about that. What are your thoughts about that?	5624_9.q	3.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5624_10	Yeah, I have definitely had quite a few tests. You know, the backtoback matches in Brisbane, threesetter there, and then playing the next day, coming here, long matches. I think these are all really good tests. As I said, I think recovery for the rest of my career is going to be extremely important, making sure I do the right amount of work to the right amount of rest that I give it. But it's feeling good.	5624_10.a	2014-01-18	F	5624	Alize Cornet	Maria Sharapova	How is the shoulder going? Do you feel more confident with every game that it's Aokay?	5624_10.q	3.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5624_11	I don't know if that's for me to judge. I got through the rounds that I have had to play so far, and I will be looking to hopefully be doing that continuously.	5624_11.a	2014-01-18	F	5624	Alize Cornet	Maria Sharapova	Do you feel like you have been a little under the radar this week because you haven't played your best? Is it possible for you to go through a first week sort of unobtrusively a little bit?	5624_11.q	3.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5624_12	Of course. She's a great retriever of the ball. It's going to be a very physical match. She likes to make it physical. That's when she plays her best. Obviously I don't want to go there with her (smiling). But, no, she's a tough opponent. That's for sure. She plays a lot of top players extremely well and tough and has nothing to lose, so I'm expecting a tough one the next round.	5624_12.a	2014-01-18	F	5624	Alize Cornet	Maria Sharapova	Talk about playing Cibulkova. She's played you tough before. It's a totally different matchup than Cornet or Knapp.	5624_12.q	3.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5624_13	Who doesn't like their grand mothers? I mean... I mean, they cook, they clean, they tell you you're the best. What's not to like?	5624_13.a	2014-01-18	F	5624	Alize Cornet	Maria Sharapova	Azarenka went on quite a bit talking about how wonderful her grandmother is and Casey Dellacqua did the same thing yesterday.	5624_13.q	3.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5624_14	Yeah, not the grandfathers? Just the grandmothers?	5624_14.a	2014-01-18	F	5624	Alize Cornet	Maria Sharapova	There are some great old pictures of you being held by your grandma. Just talk about them.	5624_14.q	3.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5624_15	I know they are a little lazy. No, I have great grandmothers. Both of them live in  one in Belarus and one still is in Russia. My mom's side mother, she comes to the United States quite a bit. Like once a year I try to force her to come, but my grandfather is usually not very happy about that. They don't usually come at the same time, but it's really nice to see her. I think you have a lot of memories from your childhood growing up, and she's the one that raised my mother and you see so many similarities. I love spending time with both of them.	5624_15.a	2014-01-18	F	5624	Alize Cornet	Maria Sharapova	Just the grandmas.	5624_15.q	3.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5624_16	I think my grandmother would refuse to go to Disneyland (smiling).	5624_16.a	2014-01-18	F	5624	Alize Cornet	Maria Sharapova	Azarenka's grandma came to LA. I think they went to Disneyland. How about sometime arranging a double date.	5624_16.q	3.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5624_17	I don't know if that's a joke. Is it? I don't know. (Smiling). Which part of it is a joke, Doug?	5624_17.a	2014-01-18	F	5624	Alize Cornet	Maria Sharapova	You're older and than Grigor and a multiple Grand Slam champion. He's making his way up the rankings. Do you ever talk or joke about that rubbing off on him?	5624_17.q	3.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5624_18	That's better. No, not really. We have a lot of different topics we discuss. That's not one of them.	5624_18.a	2014-01-18	F	5624	Alize Cornet	Maria Sharapova	Well, do you ever discuss it?	5624_18.q	3.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3747_0	I don't know. You know, today I felt a little stiff in my back, and, you know, there was a little problem there. But I tried to just think about my game and focus on every point, and I was able to win that match which is the most important thing.	3747_0.a	2011-09-01	F	3747	Jelena Dokic	Jelena Jankovic	Seems like you said your ankle was good. When you get to the US Open your back hurts. Is this a hard court thing for you?	3747_0.q	12.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
3747_1	No, just this match.	3747_1.a	2011-09-01	F	3747	Jelena Dokic	Jelena Jankovic	You've had a lot of treatment on court for your back at this tournament, have you not?	3747_1.q	12.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
3747_2	Yeah, just this match. I haven't had any treatment before that.	3747_2.a	2011-09-01	F	3747	Jelena Dokic	Jelena Jankovic	Just this match?	3747_2.q	12.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
3747_3	I have a day off tomorrow, and, you know, I will just try to receive some treatment and feel the, you know, the best as possible for my next match. I think I will be okay.	3747_3.a	2011-09-01	F	3747	Jelena Dokic	Jelena Jankovic	What are your thoughts going forward? Will it hurt your chances going forward, or is this...	3747_3.q	12.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
3747_4	It happened in the first set, in the beginning of the first set. You know, I felt a little restricted when I was hitting my serves, and especially when I had to bend down for the returns when I was waiting to return her serves. So it gave me some trouble, but like I said, I tried to play the tennis and I didn't really think about, you know, the problem that I had. I just wanted to continue, and I gave my best.	3747_4.a	2011-09-01	F	3747	Jelena Dokic	Jelena Jankovic	When did this happen?	3747_4.q	12.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
3747_5	Yes, I woke up today fine. It happened, you know, suddenly in the match.	3747_5.a	2011-09-01	F	3747	Jelena Dokic	Jelena Jankovic	So you woke up today fine?	3747_5.q	12.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
3747_6	I feel okay now. You know, I just received some treatment. I think I will be fine to play, you know, my next round.	3747_6.a	2011-09-01	F	3747	Jelena Dokic	Jelena Jankovic	How do you feel now?	3747_6.q	12.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
3747_7	I don't know. That's like the physio stuff to do. Okay, guys, I'm gonna tell you all these things. Oh, the massage with this they do that, pull my finger. (Laughter.) I don't know. That's their job to do. I'm a tennis player, and I play my -- I do my job and the physios do theirs.	3747_7.a	2011-09-01	F	3747	Jelena Dokic	Jelena Jankovic	What treatment beyond massage? Electric stimulation?	3747_7.q	12.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
3747_8	That's what she said? She played better than me off the ground?	3747_8.a	2011-09-01	F	3747	Jelena Dokic	Jelena Jankovic	What's it like to play a player whose serve just unravels? Dokic said that off the ground she felt she played better than you, but her serve killed her.	3747_8.q	12.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
3747_9	Okay. I think her serve was, you know, very inconsistent. You know, she would give me a lot of free points on that stroke. So I really, you know, felt comfortable, you know, on the ground playing my shots. When I was able to dictate, especially when I kind of lift up my level of play up, I would kind of be on a roll and kind of control the whole game. But then like I said, you know, I had some problems, and then I was kind of -- I would kind of stop and I wouldn't move as much. Then my serve, I started double faults as well because I couldn't push off. As far as for the game, you know, I felt, you know, good. I didn't feel that -- I felt comfortable and in control, even though at times I was down 3-1 and 4-2 in the second. It was just a matter of me, you know, focusing a little more and kind of lifting a little, you know, my game of play. Because especially in the beginning of the first set I thought I made a lot of mistakes and I kind of gave it to her, you know, and she took the lead. As soon as I started playing more solid and started dictating the points a lot more, then it was all me out there. So I'm happy with my win, and I look forward to my next round.	3747_9.a	2011-09-01	F	3747	Jelena Dokic	Jelena Jankovic	Yes, she did.	3747_9.q	12.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
6237_0	Well, I mean, I think I got unbelievably lucky today. Let's be quite honest. I think he deserved it. Yeah, I mean, the first match point was crazy. Then there was a few other ones, as well. It was so close. Could be my greatest escape thus far. I've had some good ones over the years, but this one might just top it all because I was literally out of the point at one stage. I had to come up with some shots that were hard to do anyways. But on match point even more so. So I feel a bit sorry for Leonardo, I must say. But that's how it goes. You win some, you lose some. So, yeah, that was my feeling.	6237_0.a	2014-10-08	M	6237	nan	Roger Federer	Quite the escape. Another big one. Talk about the match, how you think you were able to pull it out.	6237_0.q	3.0	1	2nd Round	SHANGHAI ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
6237_1	I was actually not thinking about it going in because I've been playing really well in practice. Then conditions were quite slower tonight. I mean, it's cooler. I think the court gets a bit deader. Doesn't skid as much. Doesn't travel through the air as much. I had a hard time putting the balls away sometimes. Then midway through the third set I was like, Yeah, I have been on vacation actually, so it's normal that I'm struggling, I guess. I wasn't quite happy with the way I was playing at times. I was trying to go for an alltime record of missed volleys tonight. Maybe that had something to do with it, the eyes weren't following of balls perfectly, I wasn't reading the plays maybe as easily as I was before my vacation. But every match I get, every minute I spend more on the court is going to be helpful. I'm happy I get another chance today.	6237_1.a	2014-10-08	M	6237	nan	Roger Federer	Taking time off after Davis Cup, did you feel it in this first match back?	6237_1.q	3.0	1	2nd Round	SHANGHAI ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
6237_2	Yeah, they're amazing. They're all sitting all together at the moment, which is cool. I wish they would be further down, but what can you do. They're very excited. They're very sweet to always support me. They truly believe in me. When I arrived in Shanghai, they asked me if I'm already coming back next year. It's always quite fun. I'm happy I gave them also another match today. I'm very thankful for their support.	6237_2.a	2014-10-08	M	6237	nan	Roger Federer	Something you want to say to your fans?	6237_2.q	3.0	1	2nd Round	SHANGHAI ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
6237_3	Yeah, I mean, it's good news. Better moving up than down. Nothing more than that. Clearly I want to move up, play well. Others not playing so well. Clearly Rafa hasn't played for some time. Take advantage of that. Plus I didn't win a slam this year, so it shows even more so how consistent I've actually played and how much I played this year. So I guess I deserve it from that standpoint. I'll just keep on playing well. Sometimes it might help me with the seedings, but there's only a few tournaments left. In the World Tour Finals it might not change anything anyway. Might be in the same group. For the rest, we'll see how it goes. I'm happy I'm playing so much freer this year and so much better. Last year here was sort of my comeback really because I had so many issues for almost five months, which wasn't so cool, to be quite honest.	6237_3.a	2014-10-08	M	6237	nan	Roger Federer	We understand you're going to move to No.2 when it's next adjusted. That's another achievement from a great year you've had. What would you comment about that?	6237_3.q	3.0	1	2nd Round	SHANGHAI ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
6237_4	Yeah, I'm feeling better. I was not so well, wasn't bad, but throat and nose blocked, all that, last few days. I feel like it's clearing, so I'm quite happy. Might also affect the way you play sometimes, how you feel out there. Maybe your energy. I don't know what it is. But I'm hopeful that tomorrow I'll feel better again.	6237_4.a	2014-10-08	M	6237	nan	Roger Federer	You sound congested. Are you feeling okay healthwise?	6237_4.q	3.0	1	2nd Round	SHANGHAI ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
6237_5	Yeah, I think clearly I would prefer to play 4:00 or 6:00. But I've been just going at those night sessions bigtime lately. All my matches in Toronto were, all the ones at the US Open were. Here we go again. Once you get into the night session mood, and they can't put me at 1:00 today, that would be in 12 hours, it would work, but it's not quite fair to me. It's going to be another late night here in Shanghai. But now once I'm in the rhythm at least it's just going to be crazy. Going to go to bed at 3:00, 3:30, then wake up at noon, have breakfast. I don't know, it's going to be crazy. I'll come out on court and give my best. As long as the fans and the tournament are happy, it's all good. Who cares about me, right (laughter)? No, I'm happy to be here. I'm very, very happy.	6237_5.a	2014-10-08	M	6237	nan	Roger Federer	The schedule is good for the fans that they put you the latest match every day. Probably it's not good for you to be put in the last match every day.	6237_5.q	3.0	1	2nd Round	SHANGHAI ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
5917_0	Yeah, I mean, obviously it's unfortunate, you know, especially for a guy like him. I think he's been playing really good tennis to be in the top 5, and, you know, I wish him nothing but the best and a good recovery. It's obviously sad, and, you know, I know he's a quality player and a class act, so I hope he recovers well for Indian Wells and Miami and has a good year ahead.	5917_0.a	2014-02-25	M	5917	Juan Martin Del Potro	Somdev Devvarman	How does it feel? I know it would have been good to finish the match.	5917_0.q	78.0	1	1st Round	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP500
5917_1	I actually...	5917_1.a	2014-02-25	M	5917	Juan Martin Del Potro	Somdev Devvarman	You were probably aware that he was having this problem before. Is it hard to play...	5917_1.q	78.0	1	1st Round	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP500
5917_2	No, I had no clue. After starting the match, I realized that he wasn't very comfortable hitting backhands obviously, and I tried to make him hit as many as I could, and he wasn't really hitting over it, so I knew that he wasn't happy. You know, I think tough conditions out there, obviously, regardless of whether his wrist was okay or not. I felt like it was windy or wasn't that easy to play. I just tried to fight hard and tried my best to make things tough for him, make things easier for me. You know, I'm just happy, happy that I got through today.	5917_2.a	2014-02-25	M	5917	Juan Martin Del Potro	Somdev Devvarman	You didn't know?	5917_2.q	78.0	1	1st Round	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP500
5917_3	I have no idea (smiling). I mean, I wish like I had a formula or recipe for you, but I haven't been doing anything different. I have just been working extremely hard. I have been doing that all my career, and sometimes things just click. I wish I had like an answer for you, but I don't know. I'm just going to go back and keep working hard, keep trying my best and then see how things go. I don't even know I didn't even look at the draw. I have no clue who I'm playing next, actually. I will just take things one step at a time and do my best.	5917_3.a	2014-02-25	M	5917	Juan Martin Del Potro	Somdev Devvarman	You have been playing really well of late. You won the challenger last week. Talk about what's going on, how come it's all coming together.	5917_3.q	78.0	1	1st Round	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP500
5917_4	Probably like 3All or so. At that point I felt like he was chipping a lot. I have seen him play a good amount of matches. He doesn't really chip a whole lot. Then towards the end of the set I felt he was flagging some long and missing some in the net. I felt like he was uncomfortable. That's why he went to the chip. You know, obviously the goal is to see how many times I can make him come over it when he's not happy to do it. Like I said, I don't feel like, at least right now, I don't feel like anything I'm just happy to be through, but I don't feel like it was a quality top10 win or anything. It's unfortunate that the guy was injured. You know, even though I feel like I'm playing well, it would have been nice to play a match against a top5 guy and see how I did.	5917_4.a	2014-02-25	M	5917	Juan Martin Del Potro	Somdev Devvarman	At what point did you figure the wrist, that he was not hitting his backhands?	5917_4.q	78.0	1	1st Round	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP500
5917_5	Yeah, I hit an ace on the first one. I felt like he was leaning to his right. I hit an ace. Then came in on one, make him hit a backhand pass and I know he's not happy hitting backhands. Then I hit another good serve after that. Yeah, I felt like I played those points well. Funny thing is if I hadn't, we could still be out there, could be out there on court, he could be up a set and a break and I wouldn't be sitting here for sure. Yeah, I'm just happy that I ended up playing those points well and won the breaker.	5917_5.a	2014-02-25	M	5917	Juan Martin Del Potro	Somdev Devvarman	You played the set points really well. Can you remember them and talk through them?	5917_5.q	78.0	1	1st Round	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP500
5917_6	Yeah, definitely. Definitely had nothing to lose going out, playing against a guy like that. By no means am I I mean, I didn't look at the odds, but I'm assuming they were heavily stacked against me. So, yeah, definitely nothing to lose and I felt like I was playing well. I just went out there and competed and played hard and did everything I could to win. Honestly lucky that it turned out that way.	5917_6.a	2014-02-25	M	5917	Juan Martin Del Potro	Somdev Devvarman	Did you feel you had nothing to lose, or...	5917_6.q	78.0	1	1st Round	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP500
5917_7	I mean, only if you get the right ball to come in. Like I feel like against quality guys you can't force your way in. It's got to be a natural shot, and you've got to hit a good shot to come in. Sometimes I had the right opportunity and I came in. It wasn't a strategy or anything. But when you have a chance against these guys, you've got to make them come up with the goods.	5917_7.a	2014-02-25	M	5917	Juan Martin Del Potro	Somdev Devvarman	(Question aboutcoming to the net.)	5917_7.q	78.0	1	1st Round	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP500
5917_8	Yeah, it's great. I think there was a few points there where we had a long exchange and I hit a good shot to end the point, and the crowd seemed like they were having a good time. So, yeah, it does feel like we have a lot of Indian support, which is nice. I hope they come out for the next one, too.	5917_8.a	2014-02-25	M	5917	Juan Martin Del Potro	Somdev Devvarman	Does it feel like home ground here?	5917_8.q	78.0	1	1st Round	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP500
48_0	I don't know at this point, but I was feeling it during the match. It just wasn't smart for me to take a risk, and, you know, potentially be out for a long time. It's something I want to kind of take care of right away.	48_0.a	2015-06-24	F	48	Belinda Bencic	Eugenie Bouchard	How serious is the injury?	48_0.q	12.0	0	3rd Round	AEGON INTERNATIONAL EASTBOURNE	Premier
48_1	Yeah, about during the first set, you know, I was serving at a much slower pace than even just yesterday, and I kept trying and trying. I mean, at the end it was hard for me to put a serve in just because I felt that pain a little bit. I thought it would be better to stop.	48_1.a	2015-06-24	F	48	Belinda Bencic	Eugenie Bouchard	What stage did it start? The first set was pretty competitive.	48_1.q	12.0	0	3rd Round	AEGON INTERNATIONAL EASTBOURNE	Premier
48_2	No, it's something I mean, it's something I have had in the past, though. But it started today.	48_2.a	2015-06-24	F	48	Belinda Bencic	Eugenie Bouchard	Did you feel it yesterday at all?	48_2.q	12.0	0	3rd Round	AEGON INTERNATIONAL EASTBOURNE	Premier
48_3	I mean, I'm going to play no matter what, even if I'm on one leg (smiling). Yeah, I will take a few days off from serving and give it a little break and see how it goes.	48_3.a	2015-06-24	F	48	Belinda Bencic	Eugenie Bouchard	Any fears for Wimbledon at the moment?	48_3.q	12.0	0	3rd Round	AEGON INTERNATIONAL EASTBOURNE	Premier
48_4	A little bit, but I think there are much worse things in life. It's been a rough time for me these past couple of months, for sure, with, you know, my tennis and all these changes and a couple of injuries here and there. I know it will turn around and things will start going my way soon.	48_4.a	2015-06-24	F	48	Belinda Bencic	Eugenie Bouchard	Do you feel the fates have been against you?	48_4.q	12.0	0	3rd Round	AEGON INTERNATIONAL EASTBOURNE	Premier
48_5	I will go see the doctors and physios again. Just rest a little bit today, tomorrow at least, and see how it feels on the weekend. You know, just kind of save myself for matches maybe.	48_5.a	2015-06-24	F	48	Belinda Bencic	Eugenie Bouchard	Will you have more treatments today?	48_5.q	12.0	0	3rd Round	AEGON INTERNATIONAL EASTBOURNE	Premier
48_6	Well, they know I intend to play, so it's just about managing it to the best of my abilities because it is a Grand Slam.	48_6.a	2015-06-24	F	48	Belinda Bencic	Eugenie Bouchard	(Indiscernible.)	48_6.q	12.0	0	3rd Round	AEGON INTERNATIONAL EASTBOURNE	Premier
48_7	Yes, I'm looking forward to going back to Wimbledon, of course. You know, it was the highlight of my career so far. Hopefully I can make more highlights like that, and, you know, I want to work towards, you know, achieving a final or winning a Grand Slam throughout my career. So that's always the goal. I'm not worried about defending one specific tournament. I just want to do it again anywhere.	48_7.a	2015-06-24	F	48	Belinda Bencic	Eugenie Bouchard	What are your memories of last year? Obviously Wimbledon was a massive highlight.	48_7.q	12.0	0	3rd Round	AEGON INTERNATIONAL EASTBOURNE	Premier
48_8	I mean, I don't think walking to Wimbledon I will feel like magic powder sprinkled on me, although it does have that effect on people (smiling). But, you know, throughout this whole process I have just been focusing day by day and week by week, okay, I will try my best this week and see if it will happen. It's been a long slow process. I feel like I have been playing better recently, and I do love the grass and I love obviously the atmosphere at Wimbledon. I know I will enjoy it no matter what happens.	48_8.a	2015-06-24	F	48	Belinda Bencic	Eugenie Bouchard	Have you looked at it as an opportunity to revitalize your form, given how well you did last year?	48_8.q	12.0	0	3rd Round	AEGON INTERNATIONAL EASTBOURNE	Premier
48_9	It does, yeah, and just to feel like myself a bit more on the court. I do take a match like yesterday as a solid step forward. So not looking at today, I feel like with a couple of good days' practice I will feel good for next week, hopefully.	48_9.a	2015-06-24	F	48	Belinda Bencic	Eugenie Bouchard	Obviously it's a bit soon to put it into context now, but yesterday's performance, does that give you a lot of confidence that you are beginning to find a way through with all these tweaks you are doing to your game?	48_9.q	12.0	0	3rd Round	AEGON INTERNATIONAL EASTBOURNE	Premier
48_10	I'm going to go back and see him after, but we just looked at it quickly. I'm going go back and talk to them more at length now. I just wanted to come talk to you guys.	48_10.a	2015-06-24	F	48	Belinda Bencic	Eugenie Bouchard	What was the doctor's diagnosis?	48_10.q	12.0	0	3rd Round	AEGON INTERNATIONAL EASTBOURNE	Premier
48_11	Yeah, yeah, in my abdominal.	48_11.a	2015-06-24	F	48	Belinda Bencic	Eugenie Bouchard	Abdominal problem?	48_11.q	12.0	0	3rd Round	AEGON INTERNATIONAL EASTBOURNE	Premier
48_12	Yes, but, I mean, the serve is so important in tennis and I don't know. It's just something I didn't want to take a risk of, especially since I had a small issue with it earlier this year, as well, and had to take some time off after.	48_12.a	2015-06-24	F	48	Belinda Bencic	Eugenie Bouchard	Is that the sort of thing you can, even if you've got a bit of discomfort, you can strap it up and play?	48_12.q	12.0	0	3rd Round	AEGON INTERNATIONAL EASTBOURNE	Premier
48_13	No. I'm going out there with one leg, like I said.	48_13.a	2015-06-24	F	48	Belinda Bencic	Eugenie Bouchard	Anything that would stop you playing next week?	48_13.q	12.0	0	3rd Round	AEGON INTERNATIONAL EASTBOURNE	Premier
48_14	Of course. Considering next week is such an important event, everyone prepares as best they can, so that's what I'm trying to do as well.	48_14.a	2015-06-24	F	48	Belinda Bencic	Eugenie Bouchard	You could have aggravated it this week and missedWimbledon altogether?	48_14.q	12.0	0	3rd Round	AEGON INTERNATIONAL EASTBOURNE	Premier
48_15	The past couple of months have been tough, and I have felt with everything, you know, I have had to deal with in terms of coaching changes and, you know, not playing well and all these things, for sure it's not as fun to go out on the court. But I have realized over that period that the most important thing is to enjoy the tennis and enjoy working hard and keep believing that I can get through it. I have been trying to focus more on that since I have performed less well, because at the end of the day that's why I play.	48_15.a	2015-06-24	F	48	Belinda Bencic	Eugenie Bouchard	Everyone prefers winning to losing, but when you have had a run of bad results for the first time in many years, does it ever take away some of the fun of just hitting the ball?	48_15.q	12.0	0	3rd Round	AEGON INTERNATIONAL EASTBOURNE	Premier
48_16	I think something I realized maybe around Paris was that I think I was just thinking too much on the court. Tennis, you have to react so quickly and you don't have time to think. So for me, I was thinking about where I was going to hit, how I was going to hit. It just slowed me down so much, and I was hesitating. And my game is so instinctive and just naturally reacting without thinking and playing that that really kind of slowed me up a little bit. So I feel like that was a part of it, where I'm now just trying to go out on the court and tell myself, Just don't think.	48_16.a	2015-06-24	F	48	Belinda Bencic	Eugenie Bouchard	You talked a lot about feeling lost on court. Have you been able to put your finger on why you feel you're not you?	48_16.q	12.0	0	3rd Round	AEGON INTERNATIONAL EASTBOURNE	Premier
48_17	I haven't, but I have spoken with my team around me and, you know, we have talked about a lot of different things. I feel like I have begun to learn things on my own, which I think is a good thing, as well. I'm not saying I wouldn't ever use that in the future. I totally can. I feel like in the past month or so I have found kind of answers within, and, you know, I know how good I can play. I know what to do on a tennis court. It's just about bringing it out.	48_17.a	2015-06-24	F	48	Belinda Bencic	Eugenie Bouchard	Have you had sports psychology to help that side and make you get better with your frame of mind?	48_17.q	12.0	0	3rd Round	AEGON INTERNATIONAL EASTBOURNE	Premier
48_18	That's the milliondollar question (smiling).	48_18.a	2015-06-24	F	48	Belinda Bencic	Eugenie Bouchard	How do you block out these thoughts now, your thinking on court?	48_18.q	12.0	0	3rd Round	AEGON INTERNATIONAL EASTBOURNE	Premier
48_19	No. I think I have good focus in general. You know, I feel like I did really well last year, as well. So maybe because I maybe was overthinking a little bit it took me off the main task at hand, but in general I think I'm good at that.	48_19.a	2015-06-24	F	48	Belinda Bencic	Eugenie Bouchard	Do you find that you get quite easily distracted?	48_19.q	12.0	0	3rd Round	AEGON INTERNATIONAL EASTBOURNE	Premier
48_20	Yeah. Well, in tennis and in life, as well. There are ups and downs. It's just important to take them as they come and keep your head up and, you know, understand that these are great problems to have, as well.	48_20.a	2015-06-24	F	48	Belinda Bencic	Eugenie Bouchard	Has the last 18 months taught you about the value of momentum?	48_20.q	12.0	0	3rd Round	AEGON INTERNATIONAL EASTBOURNE	Premier
48_21	I do feel that way. I feel like I'm in a completely different situation this year from last year. Last year I had nothing to lose and the players probably didn't know me as well. It was only upside. And this year I feel like the hunted where everyone is kind of gunning for me and I have a target on my back. It's the position I want to be in, because Serena has that every week of the year for the past 10plus years. I will ask her how she deals with it. But it's what I want to work towards. I want to be in this position and even in a better position. But it takes adaptation, I think, and getting used to and just being able to deal with that expectation and pressure.	48_21.a	2015-06-24	F	48	Belinda Bencic	Eugenie Bouchard	Do you feel your opponents are raising their game even more now when they are playing you now because you are a big name and etcetera?	48_21.q	12.0	0	3rd Round	AEGON INTERNATIONAL EASTBOURNE	Premier
48_22	Well, I have had that question the past couple of months, just always comparing to last year, and I don't want to feel bad this year because of a great thing I accomplished last year. If you think about it, it's crazy. Whether I defend points that specific week or if I make the final of the US Open, how is that different, you know? So I think because of the way the rankings work, people look at week to week when they compare years, but I just look at it as an opportunity to try and win a tournament, like I look at that every single week. At the end of the year I will look back and see how my year was, but I'm just going to forget about last year and just remember the nice memories. But it's Wimbledon 2015. I want to try to do whatever I can.	48_22.a	2015-06-24	F	48	Belinda Bencic	Eugenie Bouchard	You're going to get that a lot next week with press. They will ask the same question, how are you going to match last year. How are you going to deal with that constant speculation where actually you just want to be left alone to play?	48_22.q	12.0	0	3rd Round	AEGON INTERNATIONAL EASTBOURNE	Premier
48_23	Or win it (smiling).	48_23.a	2015-06-24	F	48	Belinda Bencic	Eugenie Bouchard	Reach the final again?	48_23.q	12.0	0	3rd Round	AEGON INTERNATIONAL EASTBOURNE	Premier
3440_0	Well, it's the first match and tricky opponent. Um, I didn't really play my best tennis today, so I had to really, you know, fight and dig in. That's what made it also harder.	3440_0.a	2011-02-16	F	3440	Shuai Peng	Victoria Azarenka	Why was that so tough?	3440_0.q	9.0	1	2nd Round	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS WOMEN	Premier
3440_1	I think I was fighting a lot today. As I said, I didn't play my best tennis. It was hard to get rhythm also with a little bit of wind, but I managed to stay in the match. I had a few opportunities in the first set, as well in the third. I didn't convert them. But I think she played really well. She's the type of player sometimes you don't know what to expect. She has some up and downs, and obviously you could see that in our game today.	3440_1.a	2011-02-16	F	3440	Shuai Peng	Victoria Azarenka	What do you think got you through the match?	3440_1.q	9.0	1	2nd Round	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS WOMEN	Premier
3440_2	I think it's tough conditions here. You know, the courts are a little bit tricky. It depends on the way how well you adjust. So for me, last year was great, but this year is new year. You know, I'm going to play different opponents, so I'm just really looking forward to it. I'm glad I had a tough match today to make me -- for me to go through that.	3440_2.a	2011-02-16	F	3440	Shuai Peng	Victoria Azarenka	You've done well here in the past. Is this somewhere that suits your game, the conditions here?	3440_2.q	9.0	1	2nd Round	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS WOMEN	Premier
3440_3	Well, obviously everything. You know, I need to raise my level on everything, especially with the serve. It was a little bit tough today, but I'm looking forward to it. You know, there is a lot to improve, and I have to work harder. But I'm glad that I fought hard today, and in the important moments I stayed there. At the end of the day, I won the match.	3440_3.a	2011-02-16	F	3440	Shuai Peng	Victoria Azarenka	So what did you learn from coming out of today? You did have seven double faults. What do you have to work on going into your next match?	3440_3.q	9.0	1	2nd Round	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS WOMEN	Premier
3440_4	No, because I didn't want to really think about it too much. As I said, there were a lot of up and downs and a lot of breaks. It was hard to hold few serves on one side for me today. But, um, I was just looking for the next point, next point. That was the key today, I guess.	3440_4.a	2011-02-16	F	3440	Shuai Peng	Victoria Azarenka	You served for the match twice and didn't serve it out. Does that affect your confidence?	3440_4.q	9.0	1	2nd Round	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS WOMEN	Premier
3440_5	Well, it was sun, it was wind, but it was for both. For me, I didn't really adjust too well. That's what I have to do better next time.	3440_5.a	2011-02-16	F	3440	Shuai Peng	Victoria Azarenka	On one side was it the sun or the wind? What was the problem?	3440_5.q	9.0	1	2nd Round	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS WOMEN	Premier
3440_6	Yeah. Well, there is a lot of work. Sometimes little bit luck also as well, I think. But to me, as you said, I still haven't passed so far into the tournament, and I'm just looking forward to do that. I'm going to try to do my best, but it depends on a lot of things.	3440_6.a	2011-02-16	F	3440	Shuai Peng	Victoria Azarenka	You've been in and around the top 10 for quite a long time now. What do you think you need to do to make the breakthrough, in the Grand Slams particularly? I think quarterfinals is your best so far, isn't it?	3440_6.q	9.0	1	2nd Round	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS WOMEN	Premier
3440_7	Definitely. You know, I got stronger physically this year, which is also very important in a Grand Slam because it's a two-week tournament. So, you know, I feel like I'm improving. There is -- it's time a different time for everybody.	3440_7.a	2011-02-16	F	3440	Shuai Peng	Victoria Azarenka	Is it a question of keeping up a level for two weeks, seven matches?	3440_7.q	9.0	1	2nd Round	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS WOMEN	Premier
3440_8	Well, obviously you always you would like to win easy and comfortable, but I think it's good to go through that. You feel in the first match you're already in the tournament, you're ready to fight. It's good to test yourself.	3440_8.a	2011-02-16	F	3440	Shuai Peng	Victoria Azarenka	I was going to ask, Victoria, while you wouldn't have chosen to get through the way you did today, do you feel it gives you a sort of instant competitiveness that perhaps other tennis players that have got through easier haven't had? You've come through a tough test and you're ready for subsequent ones if they come along?	3440_8.q	9.0	1	2nd Round	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS WOMEN	Premier
3440_9	You know quite a lot about me and her, you know. (Smiling.) I might think of you as a stalker a little bit. We haven't talked about the draw, because me personally, I never look at the draw. We spent time yesterday at the party. You didn't know about that, so I'm just informing you. But, yeah, we always keep in touch about different stuff. But tennis is our job. We normally try to stay away from it.	3440_9.a	2011-02-16	F	3440	Shuai Peng	Victoria Azarenka	Have you spoken to Caroline, your good friend? You're both at opposite ends of the draw. I presume you have the same agent or representation. You went out for dinner I think the other night. Do you liaise on that level?	3440_9.q	9.0	1	2nd Round	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS WOMEN	Premier
3440_10	That's what I don't know either. You know, I know a lot, but I don't know either.	3440_10.a	2011-02-16	F	3440	Shuai Peng	Victoria Azarenka	Something else we don't know about you, how many pair of shoes have you got?	3440_10.q	9.0	1	2nd Round	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS WOMEN	Premier
3440_11	I left about 9:28.	3440_11.a	2011-02-16	F	3440	Shuai Peng	Victoria Azarenka	How late did you both stay at the party?	3440_11.q	9.0	1	2nd Round	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS WOMEN	Premier
3440_12	I think. You know, my hitting partner, he was really hungry, so we had to stay a while.	3440_12.a	2011-02-16	F	3440	Shuai Peng	Victoria Azarenka	Wow.	3440_12.q	9.0	1	2nd Round	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS WOMEN	Premier
4780_0	I felt something in my shoulder yesterday, but we still don't know what it is because I haven't had time to see the doctor or anything yet. But, uhm, yeah, you know, these things happen, and you just have to play through the pain sometimes. But I thought Sloane played really well today.	4780_0.a	2013-01-19	F	4780	Sloane Stephens	Laura Robson	Can you explain to us what happened there in the first set. Had you arrived with a problem or did it happen within the match?	4780_0.q	53.0	0	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4780_1	Well, I don't know how fast I usually serve, but I would say today was a fair bit slower. But, yeah, I just did what I had to do really.	4780_1.a	2013-01-19	F	4780	Sloane Stephens	Laura Robson	How much did it affect you on your serve, what you could do with your first serve?	4780_1.q	53.0	0	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4780_2	No.	4780_2.a	2013-01-19	F	4780	Sloane Stephens	Laura Robson	Quite a long discussion during the medical timeout. Did you consider pulling out?	4780_2.q	53.0	0	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4780_3	I thought there were a fair amount of long rallies today, which there wasn't in Hobart. So that's probably a good thing. Yeah, I thought we both played a bit better than we did last week.	4780_3.a	2013-01-19	F	4780	Sloane Stephens	Laura Robson	Do you feel this match was any different than the one in Hobart?	4780_3.q	53.0	0	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4780_4	Well, we've played each other twice in two weeks, so I can see it happening again at some point, yeah.	4780_4.a	2013-01-19	F	4780	Sloane Stephens	Laura Robson	Would we be wrong to assume that this is just the initial stages of a long series of the two of you playing against one another?	4780_4.q	53.0	0	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4780_5	Yeah, I mean, you end up playing everyone a fair few times. I'm sure I'll play Sloane a lot in the future. I'm sure after today she's going to be top 20. So good for her.	4780_5.a	2013-01-19	F	4780	Sloane Stephens	Laura Robson	You're both going right up the rankings.	4780_5.q	53.0	0	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4780_6	So what is the question?	4780_6.a	2013-01-19	F	4780	Sloane Stephens	Laura Robson	When the trainer was with you, did they know where you hurt? Looked like you were in a lot of distress all down the lefthand side.	4780_6.q	53.0	0	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4780_7	Uhm, I think you would be in pain, too, if someone was prodding into your shoulder. So, yeah, the physios knew about it beforehand and I was taped up and everything. Yeah, they just came on and tried to help me with it.	4780_7.a	2013-01-19	F	4780	Sloane Stephens	Laura Robson	The question is, what was the extent of that pain? It looked like you were in some considerable pain.	4780_7.q	53.0	0	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4780_8	It was amazing. Yeah, I was really quite shocked to see the whole court was full. There were so many British people, maybe some Australians supporting me as well, which is good. They were very loud.	4780_8.a	2013-01-19	F	4780	Sloane Stephens	Laura Robson	What did you think of the support you got out on court today?	4780_8.q	53.0	0	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4780_9	No. I think Show Court 2 is still relatively large. Yeah, I was happy with the court choice. There's nothing wrong with it. I'm unseeded. I think Sloane is seeded, what, 32 or something. So, yeah, we're not both top 10. So any court is a good court.	4780_9.a	2013-01-19	F	4780	Sloane Stephens	Laura Robson	There were some people saying they forced themselves to go watch the Seppi and Cilic match before yours to make sure they could have a seat for yours. Were you surprised to be on such a small court?	4780_9.q	53.0	0	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4780_10	I ended up going to sleep around 3:00, which is pretty good considering what time I finished. And, yeah, I woke up normal time yesterday, practiced, had another ice bath and, yeah, felt fine.	4780_10.a	2013-01-19	F	4780	Sloane Stephens	Laura Robson	What time did you get to sleep after Kvitova and what was the rest day like?	4780_10.q	53.0	0	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4780_11	Last night.	4780_11.a	2013-01-19	F	4780	Sloane Stephens	Laura Robson	When did the shoulder start to become an issue?	4780_11.q	53.0	0	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4780_12	Yeah, after practice. I don't know what I did yet. So we have to try to figure that out.	4780_12.a	2013-01-19	F	4780	Sloane Stephens	Laura Robson	After some practice, or did it just come on?	4780_12.q	53.0	0	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4780_13	Pretty good. I mean, last year I lost here 2Love first round. It's a massive improvement. There's still so many things that can be worked on. But, yeah, I toughed out of the two wins. And today I thought Sloane played pretty well. So, yes, still a pretty good tournament.	4780_13.a	2013-01-19	F	4780	Sloane Stephens	Laura Robson	How does the week sit with you overall?	4780_13.q	53.0	0	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4780_14	I would say shot selection in the points. You know, sometimes I still go for a bit too much where I'd be better off playing an easier shot rather than going for winners the whole time. And, yeah, you know, I think I can improve on anything. Movement is still an inprogress thing. Lots of things really.	4780_14.a	2013-01-19	F	4780	Sloane Stephens	Laura Robson	You say there are a lot of things you can work on. What in particular?	4780_14.q	53.0	0	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4780_15	Against anyone, you know, if you try to finish the rally too early, it's never going to work out that well. So, yeah, I mean, Sloane obviously moves extremely well. I thought today my shot selection actually wasn't too bad.	4780_15.a	2013-01-19	F	4780	Sloane Stephens	Laura Robson	Is the shot selection a particular issue playing somebody like Sloane who gets so many balls back?	4780_15.q	53.0	0	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4780_16	I don't know yet. But I don't think it was to do with the match against Kvitova because I felt okay in practice yesterday. Yeah, physically I was fine up until last night.	4780_16.a	2013-01-19	F	4780	Sloane Stephens	Laura Robson	Do you think the shoulder pain is just the result of having played 119 in the third the day before, or is it something more serious?	4780_16.q	53.0	0	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4780_17	I'm still entered in Pattaya. Obviously I can still play there. Definitely still looking to play Fed Cup.	4780_17.a	2013-01-19	F	4780	Sloane Stephens	Laura Robson	Is next up Fed Cup or anything in between?	4780_17.q	53.0	0	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
2624_0	First thing, very happy, no? Is a very good end of the season anyway the result of tomorrow. For me, finish the season winning all the matches in the group, three victories against top-eight players in probably the most difficult surface for me, is unbelievable now. Very happy for be in semifinals. Tomorrow for sure going to be a very difficult match against one of the best players of the world. Maybe the circumstances are more favorable for him. But I'm very happy how I am playing, how I improved during the tournament. And for me today was a very good match.	2624_0.a	2010-11-26	M	2624	Tomas Berdych	Rafael Nadal	Obviously you're into the semifinals. The emotions are very different from last year. Three wins rather than three defeats. How do you feel?	2624_0.q	1.0	1	Round Robin	BARCLAYS ATP WORLD TOUR FINALS	Masters Cup
2624_1	Maybe you know, if my ball came inside or not? One caller says out, the only question is, when I return the ball, my ball came inside or go out?	2624_1.a	2010-11-26	M	2624	Tomas Berdych	Rafael Nadal	Obviously the point in the first set where you queried the awarding of the point to Berdych. What do you think happen?	2624_1.q	1.0	1	Round Robin	BARCLAYS ATP WORLD TOUR FINALS	Masters Cup
2624_2	The ball came in? I thought that. So for that there is no discussion. I am right, but is mistake for him. But he is a great umpire and everybody have a mistake. I think he did today. Everybody have a mistake. If my ball went out, the mistake was myself.	2624_2.a	2010-11-26	M	2624	Tomas Berdych	Rafael Nadal	The ball came in.	2624_2.q	1.0	1	Round Robin	BARCLAYS ATP WORLD TOUR FINALS	Masters Cup
2624_3	The important thing, I was playing really well before that point. This point doesn't change a lot. Finally I was lucky. I won that game. Finally I won the match, no? But doesn't change nothing, that point. I think I still playing the same level before that point and after that point. But maybe Tomas goes down a little bit in the second, and I feel every time better and better. This point doesn't make any effect on the match.	2624_3.a	2010-11-26	M	2624	Tomas Berdych	Rafael Nadal	You seemed to be pretty upset at that point. Somehow after that you were able to use the aggression and run away with the match from there. How do you manage to do that?	2624_3.q	1.0	1	Round Robin	BARCLAYS ATP WORLD TOUR FINALS	Masters Cup
2624_4	No, no. Seriously not. For me the US Open was a big emotion for me to complete the all four titles. But talking about emotion for me winning the first time in Wimbledon was something unbelievable. It was a dream for me. First Roland Garros, second and fifth was really emotion for me, too. Maybe first Australia, I was too tired to feel this emotion. But in general I think every one is important. The US Open is complete something. But is special because I never played well there. I never arrived with good level there. I arrived a few times with good physical conditions, but without the right level of tennis. So I was lucky because the first time that everything is fine, I won. So that's very lucky. I feel very lucky for that, no, because I won earlier than I really thought.	2624_4.a	2010-11-26	M	2624	Tomas Berdych	Rafael Nadal	I know people have been asking you about your season all week. But specifically about the US Open. You love all the majors that you have won. Was the US Open so important to you because of the changes you made to win in New York?	2624_4.q	1.0	1	Round Robin	BARCLAYS ATP WORLD TOUR FINALS	Masters Cup
2624_5	He has a good chance to beat me?	2624_5.a	2010-11-26	M	2624	Tomas Berdych	Rafael Nadal	After Andy's game last night, he said he didn't feel he had a very good chance of beating you. Can you understand why he said that?	2624_5.q	1.0	1	Round Robin	BARCLAYS ATP WORLD TOUR FINALS	Masters Cup
2624_6	That's easy. Pull out under pressure (smiling). If you talk about the people and the specialists of tennis, everybody can say the conditions are a little bit more easier for Andy than for me here. The court is a little bit more easier for him than for me. But we can talk two days. But the only thing that really matter is what going to happen tomorrow.	2624_6.a	2010-11-26	M	2624	Tomas Berdych	Rafael Nadal	He doesn't have a good chance.	2624_6.q	1.0	1	Round Robin	BARCLAYS ATP WORLD TOUR FINALS	Masters Cup
2624_7	I say I gonna try my best. I know gonna be a really difficult match. Only chance for me to win is play my best tennis, wait that Andy didn't play his highest level, no? That's what can I say. The pression come back to him now.	2624_7.a	2010-11-26	M	2624	Tomas Berdych	Rafael Nadal	Would you ever say something like that?	2624_7.q	1.0	1	Round Robin	BARCLAYS ATP WORLD TOUR FINALS	Masters Cup
2624_8	Yeah. I said -- told him, he's wrong, I think. He's wrong. That's something unbelievable. The point is still playing, and I understand the rule. I understand the challenge, the ball was good. But if I put the ball inside, is impossible to lose the point. I say something. He told me is up to him. Okay, so... I still asking Carlos what's happening. That's all.	2624_8.a	2010-11-26	M	2624	Tomas Berdych	Rafael Nadal	One more point to clarify on that controversial point in the first set. When you wanted to speak to the supervisor, what did you say to him and what did he say back to you? Can you remember?	2624_8.q	1.0	1	Round Robin	BARCLAYS ATP WORLD TOUR FINALS	Masters Cup
2624_9	I didn't have a challenge. He called the ball out. Maybe I stopped a little bit because the ball was really close.	2624_9.a	2010-11-26	M	2624	Tomas Berdych	Rafael Nadal	To ask about that point again. I think Tomas' argument was that you had challenged already, that you had stopped play.	2624_9.q	1.0	1	Round Robin	BARCLAYS ATP WORLD TOUR FINALS	Masters Cup
2624_10	I did something like this (putting hand up), but I never say stop. To stop the point, you have to say you stop. I did something like this (holding hand up) but it's intuition because I saw the ball out. That's the true. But after I saw the umpire saying out, so I didn't see if my ball came inside or not. But if I don't see the umpire saying out, I gonna continue the point for sure because is a big risk for me to say the ball is out, you know.	2624_10.a	2010-11-26	M	2624	Tomas Berdych	Rafael Nadal	You put your hand up.	2624_10.q	1.0	1	Round Robin	BARCLAYS ATP WORLD TOUR FINALS	Masters Cup
2624_11	Yeah, always you can have a better season. For me is very difficult to imagine to have a better season. But for sure you can have a better season. You can win in every place. That's the true. It's not my case. Never going to be my case. But you can have a better season, yes. Is difficult. In my case, is almost impossible.	2624_11.a	2010-11-26	M	2624	Tomas Berdych	Rafael Nadal	Is it possible to have an even better season in 2011?	2624_11.q	1.0	1	Round Robin	BARCLAYS ATP WORLD TOUR FINALS	Masters Cup
5750_0	Nothing at all. The doubles, really nothing. The singles are much more inspiring to me. The guy played extremely well, and for me it's a bit difficult to play on that kind of surface that is fast, but especially where the ball doesn't bounce. So this is difficult for my game. It's difficult to topspin. I believe he played extremely well. It was difficult to play for me. I don't know why he's not better ranked. I didn't return well, but I fought until the end and the guy was better than I was.	5750_0.a	2014-10-29	M	5750	Roberto Bautista Agut	Richard Gasquet	So the doubles and the singles. What does it inspire you?	5750_0.q	23.0	0	2nd Round	BNP PARIBAS MASTERS	Masters 1000
5750_1	Physically I'm fine, and my tennis is not bad, but playing against a player who plays flat the way he does on that kind of surface, indoors, is difficult for me. I believe he played very well. Of course I'm not happy that I lost 64, 62, but I think he really played a really good match.	5750_1.a	2014-10-29	M	5750	Roberto Bautista Agut	Richard Gasquet	But you're not injured? The thigh is okay?	5750_1.q	23.0	0	2nd Round	BNP PARIBAS MASTERS	Masters 1000
5750_2	Well, I'm really disappointed that I lost here, of course, but after the Davis Cup it was really tough to go to Asia. After the Berdych match, my thigh was hurting a little. I think in Lille it's going to be different. I have no pain. My tennis is not bad. I feel good. And the surface will be different.	5750_2.a	2014-10-29	M	5750	Roberto Bautista Agut	Richard Gasquet	So you haven't had many victories. Is that going to be a problem for the upcoming Davis Cup?	5750_2.q	23.0	0	2nd Round	BNP PARIBAS MASTERS	Masters 1000
5750_3	Yes, but I was there to win that match today. There's no excuse. No excuse at all. As I said, I believe the guy played extremely well. The surface is not my best surface because there is no bounce. It's the worst surface for me. And as years go by I see that it's not getting better. I never had good results on that kind of surface. But it's not because I was thinking of Davis Cup that I lost that particular match. Now, in Asia it was tough. When you go to Asia it's for three weeks. After the French Open where I spent a lot of energy, it was difficult to start playing again. So now I'm ready to play on clay. I have no injuries and I'm fine.	5750_3.a	2014-10-29	M	5750	Roberto Bautista Agut	Richard Gasquet	Even if you say you were focused on this tournament, aren't you already thinking about Lille?	5750_3.q	23.0	0	2nd Round	BNP PARIBAS MASTERS	Masters 1000
5750_4	I don't see anything positive losing 4 and 2 on center court here in Bercy. But, no, it's over. Of course, yes, it's true, I can focus 100% on Davis Cup. But anyway, I'm happy that I'm not injured. I'm 100% physically. I have no pain and I'm going to play now on my best surface, so I'm happy. I'll be happy to change surfaces, play on clay, and play in another stadium. I'm going to start practicing as soon as I can to be ready.	5750_4.a	2014-10-29	M	5750	Roberto Bautista Agut	Richard Gasquet	Do you believe in the end that maybe it's better in a way that you lost? You'll have more time for the Davis Cup final.	5750_4.q	23.0	0	2nd Round	BNP PARIBAS MASTERS	Masters 1000
5750_5	Well, yes, I think we have an advantage because we have two weeks to practice on clay. It's an advantage compared with the Swiss. Now, winning or losing matches is maybe not the most important thing. The most important thing is to be fit physically, playing really good, better than I have ever played since the French Open. I will really try to start practicing as soon as I can on clay so I can sort of be in advance.	5750_5.a	2014-10-29	M	5750	Roberto Bautista Agut	Richard Gasquet	Can you tell us how you're gonna spend the rest of the week here and the next week? Are you going to play a lot of tennis or are you going to get some rest before? How are you going to adapt to clay?	5750_5.q	23.0	0	2nd Round	BNP PARIBAS MASTERS	Masters 1000
5750_6	I would prefer to play the Masters. I can't say the contrary. But a Davis Cup final is different. I honestly prefer to play a Davis Cup final than going to the Masters. I have been last year. I know how it is. Anyway, it wouldn't change my life if I had to play again in the Masters, but it would be better for me to play well in Davis Cup. Especially since we're playing at home, so it's more important to me.	5750_6.a	2014-10-29	M	5750	Roberto Bautista Agut	Richard Gasquet	Stan, who just came here, said that there were many other important events in the end of the season other than the Davis Cup, and he didn't want to think too much about the Davis Cup. He could be injured before that. And for you, is it easier? Simple? Just playing here, playing the Davis Cup?	5750_6.q	23.0	0	2nd Round	BNP PARIBAS MASTERS	Masters 1000
5750_7	I saw the '91 and the '96 ties, and 2002 in Bercy. We watched it here, like everyone else. And now being in a final is something extremely important, and I'm happy I can think about it now. And now it's good because this is the only goal I have. But I would have preferred to win today.	5750_7.a	2014-10-29	M	5750	Roberto Bautista Agut	Richard Gasquet	When you were young, do you have a precise memory of a Davis Cup final that you maybe watched on TV and that you were...	5750_7.q	23.0	0	2nd Round	BNP PARIBAS MASTERS	Masters 1000
5750_8	Well, two semifinals in a Grand Slam, only this is what I did, so it's difficult for me to say anything for Roger. He has a lot, a lot of experience. He's played hundreds of matches and Grand Slams, so I believe the decision he's making is made knowing exactly what he's doing. I mean, everything can happen, of course, but I believe that during his whole career Roger managed his schedule extremely well. So if he decided to do that, he has his own reasons, and he certainly knows what he's doing.	5750_8.a	2014-10-29	M	5750	Roberto Bautista Agut	Richard Gasquet	What is your opinion on Roger Federer playing here, playing everything? Do you think it's crazy, it's a risk he's taking?	5750_8.q	23.0	0	2nd Round	BNP PARIBAS MASTERS	Masters 1000
3236_0	Yeah, I was leading I think 4-1 and had everything under my control. I was playing pretty well. But then I just had some, you know, loose errors and she played as well some good points. And little by little, you know, she was getting her momentum, and I started, you know, completely going down. Especially in that tiebreaker, I had chances as well at 5-4. I was 15-30, then missed an easy shot to go 15-40, two breakpoints. Then in the tiebreaker I just made some bad errors at the wrong times. When you add those up, you know, that doesn't give me good. You know, it was a bad day for me. But the good thing for me is that I'm healthy. That's really important for me now, that I'm healthy, that I can really compete, I can be out there. I just have to now continue to work hard and work on my game and really build on my confidence. Hopefully I will get more matches in the future and just keep getting better.	3236_0.a	2011-01-20	F	3236	Shuai Peng	Jelena Jankovic	After a good start, it developed into a fight. How did it get away from you in the end?	3236_0.q	8.0	0	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3236_1	No, but last year, especially the last six months of last year, had really a lot of injuries. You know, I twisted my ankle and really couldn't move. Then I had an eye surgery in the off-season. So overall I had a lot of things that kind of took me off the game and didn't allow me to practice and work as well on my fitness, really work on myself. But now that's the past. Now I really feel good physically. I'm healthy. You know, I can really be on the court and enjoy myself out there. You know, it's the beginning of the season, only my third match of the year. I'm still rusty. I just have to get match tough again and play right, you know, in the important times of the match. That was the case today. I just, you know, played some wrong shots, had a wrong selection of shots at important, you know, moments of the match, and that cost me. At the end, my opponent, you know, took her opportunities and was the better one.	3236_1.a	2011-01-20	F	3236	Shuai Peng	Jelena Jankovic	You had a difficult second half to last season; this season is a slow start. How discouraging is that?	3236_1.q	8.0	0	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3236_2	I don't think it's a matter of fitness. You know, I have a bad selection of shots at the wrong times. I couldn't afford to make, you know, the errors that I made, especially at crucial times of the match. I mean, as a top player - I've been No.1 in the world - it's tough to, you know, sometimes accept those mistakes. Really at times I couldn't believe I can do that, why am I doing that. You know, it's tennis; it's sport. You just have to stay positive. You just have to, you know, learn and keep working hard and hopefully come back.	3236_2.a	2011-01-20	F	3236	Shuai Peng	Jelena Jankovic	Is it a matter of fitness when you say you're missing shots you should have made?	3236_2.q	8.0	0	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3236_3	I have to be honest, you know, it's hard to remember the last time. But I think she plays, you know, more or less the same game. She plays those flat shots. I was doing fine against her, you know, until I really let her get in the match. Then, you know, she got her confidence and started making a lot more shots in the court, got her momentum going. But, like I said, you know, she was the better one today. I had a bad day. You know, there's nothing I can do now. I just have to go forward.	3236_3.a	2011-01-20	F	3236	Shuai Peng	Jelena Jankovic	You've played her seven times with six wins. Have you seen any notable improvement in her today?	3236_3.q	8.0	0	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3236_4	I really don't know what to comment on that.	3236_4.a	2011-01-20	F	3236	Shuai Peng	Jelena Jankovic	Serbian and Croatian fans were prevented from taking their national flags into Hisense Arena last night. How does that make you feel?	3236_4.q	8.0	0	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3236_5	Well, it's always nice to see. You know, I come from Serbia. It's always nice to see, you know, the fans, those supporters that come out, especially with the flags, and they really cheer us on. I think it's nice to see. It's always nice to see fair play and nice supporters that just keep rooting their players, their favorite players. So that's, you know, what I am about.	3236_5.a	2011-01-20	F	3236	Shuai Peng	Jelena Jankovic	Is it important for you to see a Serbian flag flying in the crowd?	3236_5.q	8.0	0	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3236_6	She played pretty solid. You know, she hit those flat shots and she really, you know, stayed within herself. After I had the lead, she just started playing more consistently. She wasn't giving me much, and then I kind of went down. I just couldn't find myself anymore. And she continued in that direction. You know, she was the better player today. That's what mattered. She's the one who goes through.	3236_6.a	2011-01-20	F	3236	Shuai Peng	Jelena Jankovic	Could you make a comment about the Chinese player and her performance today?	3236_6.q	8.0	0	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3236_7	You have to ask her what she believes, if she can go up there. You know, it's tough to say and comment on one match. Especially for me, you know, after not playing for a long time and it's only my third match of the season. I haven't played. It's not like we're in the middle of the season where I played against a lot of the players and I know how everybody's playing more or less. Now it's just the third match of the season, so I don't know where I'm at, where she's at. I'm just really thinking about myself, what I can do to become, you know, stronger and to become a better player.	3236_7.a	2011-01-20	F	3236	Shuai Peng	Jelena Jankovic	Do you think Peng can be a better player with a higher ranking compared with her 50 ranking?	3236_7.q	8.0	0	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3236_8	Not surprised. I think she can come up with that game. You know, you always have to be alert. Especially, you know, she can come up with some really good shots, with really flat shots. You always have to be careful, you know, that anything can happen out there.	3236_8.a	2011-01-20	F	3236	Shuai Peng	Jelena Jankovic	But are you surprised at all with the level she showed today with some really good tennis?	3236_8.q	8.0	0	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3236_9	No. I always believe in myself. The most important thing is that I'm healthy because I can just work on my game and really work on my fitness. Then the more I play, the better I get. I think I will be able to come back and even be a stronger and a better player. I think I can do it. It's just a matter of really believing in myself and going out on the court and, you know, just keep working hard. I mean, without work it's difficult to do it. But now I'm able to do it because I'm healthy. So there is no excuses for me. Just have to continue to go forward. I mean, when things get tough... It's just the beginning of the season. It's not the end of the world. It's not really a big deal. You still have a long way to go. It's many tournaments to play. I will be there. I'm not giving up. I know I can be good and I can beat those players and I can come back to the top.	3236_9.a	2011-01-20	F	3236	Shuai Peng	Jelena Jankovic	You mentioned some injuries last year. Are you worried that you won't be able to regain the game that you had in 2007/2008?	3236_9.q	8.0	0	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3938_0	I haven't, no. I don't know. It was just amazing feeling. I don't know what kept me going, how I kept going. I was dead tired in the third set. I could hardly move. I just gave all I had left, and it just was enough.	3938_0.a	2012-06-23	F	3938	Angelique Kerber	Tamira Paszek	Have you studied the life of Houdini?	3938_0.q	59.0	1	The Final	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	Premier
3938_1	I always knew I'm a fighter, I always believed in myself, but I'd say Andrei my coach really helped me to find my passion in the game, to find my belief in myself on court. Because in practice everything has been working, and now it was just a matter of getting that aggression and pleasure to play on court. It just all fitted together this week.	3938_1.a	2012-06-23	F	3938	Angelique Kerber	Tamira Paszek	Have you surprised yourself with the way you've managed to fight through these matches this week?	3938_1.q	59.0	1	The Final	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	Premier
3938_2	It was kind of weird, because the game before I slipped on court, and I kind of hurt my Achilles and the ankle a bit, so I was like I didn't even think about the score, what was going on. She really played well that game. I just said, Okay, I'll just try a dropshot, why not, for a change? So I kept going, won that game, and then I was just like, Okay, whatever. Just keep playing, try to focus on every point. To be honest, I did not realize that it was match point or like  that was 53 down. She was serving for the match at 54. I was just like on court enjoying the atmosphere with this amazing crowd. It was unbelievable.	3938_2.a	2012-06-23	F	3938	Angelique Kerber	Tamira Paszek	When she had five match points and she didn't put any of them away, did you start to think this could be your day?	3938_2.q	59.0	1	The Final	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	Premier
3938_3	Yeah, it was getting bigger and bigger. It was so tight, and I hate tight tape. So it was like, Oh, that's feeling a bit weird on court. You have to manage to get on with things which aren't perfect. So I just tried to keep there and keep hanging there.	3938_3.a	2012-06-23	F	3938	Angelique Kerber	Tamira Paszek	Shortly afterwards you had your ankle strapped, and it was getting bigger by the minute.	3938_3.q	59.0	1	The Final	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	Premier
3938_4	I had my chances in the first two games, I was playing well, but I was playing too reserved. She just played her game and went for the shots. Changed the tactics a little bit. I played too much onto her body and on the same side all over again, so I just tried to move her a bit more and get my game going. It worked out in the end.	3938_4.a	2012-06-23	F	3938	Angelique Kerber	Tamira Paszek	In the beginning, you were almost down 4Love. Why the slow start?	3938_4.q	59.0	1	The Final	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	Premier
3938_5	I haven't seen the doctor yet. I'm going to meet the doctor afterwards. We'll have a look at that. It's feeling okay. It's a bit painful, but I'm walking, which is good.	3938_5.a	2012-06-23	F	3938	Angelique Kerber	Tamira Paszek	How is your ankle now?	3938_5.q	59.0	1	The Final	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	Premier
3938_6	Not really. Today's day of Eastbourne, Eastbourne final, you're only once in the final here in 2012, so that was my day. I tried to enjoy every moment out there. I will enjoy the rest of the day, try to relax, review the whole week, and then from tomorrow focus on Wimbledon starts.	3938_6.a	2012-06-23	F	3938	Angelique Kerber	Tamira Paszek	Have you allowed yourself any thoughts about Wimbledon yet?	3938_6.q	59.0	1	The Final	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	Premier
3938_7	Amazing. I mean, the feelings, I cannot describe them. I was sitting on the couch at home a week ago, drive from Birmingham, played a horrible match there, no confidence. I was like, Okay, just try to get at least one win under your belt before Wimbledon. My godfather was joking. He's like, You're going to bring me this cup home. I'm like, Oh, my God. That's a lot of pressure. I just took it step by step, day by day, and match by match it just went better and better and better. I haven't even met him yet. He's going to be over the moon. I love Eastbourne I'm already looking forward to come back next week.	3938_7.a	2012-06-23	F	3938	Angelique Kerber	Tamira Paszek	You've got some family connections in Eastbourne. How special was it to win in Eastbourne for you?	3938_7.q	59.0	1	The Final	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	Premier
3938_8	It's been one of the best, yeah. Of course, winning a title, you know, everything has to fit together. It was a pleasure to have all my family here, my coach here. My dad came in from London this morning, which was a surprise for me. So it makes it really special to win, first of all, the title on grass, one of my favorite surfaces, and secondly, in front of the family. So many fans and family and friends back home were watching. So I want to also thank everyone who was supporting me throughout the whole week.	3938_8.a	2012-06-23	F	3938	Angelique Kerber	Tamira Paszek	Is this the best week of your tennis life?	3938_8.q	59.0	1	The Final	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	Premier
3938_9	That's it.	3938_9.a	2012-06-23	F	3938	Angelique Kerber	Tamira Paszek	What other family did you have here apart from your father and your godparents?	3938_9.q	59.0	1	The Final	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	Premier
3938_10	That's it. Friends and people I have known since I'm like two years old. I had a couple of them here. My mom and my brother are home, but they were watching on TV.	3938_10.a	2012-06-23	F	3938	Angelique Kerber	Tamira Paszek	That's it?	3938_10.q	59.0	1	The Final	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	Premier
3938_11	I definitely think it gave me a big confidence boost. Going into Wimbledon now, it's just a different feeling than a week ago where I was low in confidence and just not sure whether I was doing the right things. Now I just feel like everything fits together. I'm happy on court. I'm enjoying every moment out there. I feel feet on court, ready to play three sets, been there three hours. Just makes me happy to be healthy out there.	3938_11.a	2012-06-23	F	3938	Angelique Kerber	Tamira Paszek	What will this do for your career now, you think?	3938_11.q	59.0	1	The Final	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	Premier
3938_12	I heard about that already. Well, Caroline's tough opponent, former world No.1, amazing competitor out there. Doesn't give you a free point. So from tomorrow I will just try to, you know, do my work with Andrei, go on court, try to adapt my game, get used to the courts, the atmosphere for Grand Slam again, and then we will see. I will go out there and enjoy every moment and try to do my best.	3938_12.a	2012-06-23	F	3938	Angelique Kerber	Tamira Paszek	A lot of people might look at your firstround match now as one of the most exciting now.	3938_12.q	59.0	1	The Final	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	Premier
3938_13	Oh, well, we know each other since we are like 10 years old. I have a picture at home. We're like both (indicating short height)? We played the final when we were Under 12 or something like that. But I think on tour she beat me once. That was the only time we played on tour, if I remember. Juniors many times.	3938_13.a	2012-06-23	F	3938	Angelique Kerber	Tamira Paszek	What's your headtohead with Caroline?	3938_13.q	59.0	1	The Final	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	Premier
5658_0	I'm feeling good. I mean, I played a great match and it was so close. It's normal that at the end a little bit you want to win at the end because it was so close, but I played a great match and looking forward to doing many matches like this.	5658_0.a	2014-01-16	F	5658	Maria Sharapova	Karin Knapp	How are you feeling now?	5658_0.q	44.0	0	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5658_1	No, it was really hot. I know that it was hot for me, but I know it was hot also for Maria. We were fighting both I think with the heat. It was really tough, but we didn't stop. We played, and that was it.	5658_1.a	2014-01-16	F	5658	Maria Sharapova	Karin Knapp	Even though it was like 44 degrees or something ridiculous, were you able to...	5658_1.q	44.0	0	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5658_2	Yeah, it was hot. I think maybe they could change some rules, because it's not the same like playing under the roof or with the sun. So maybe.	5658_2.a	2014-01-16	F	5658	Maria Sharapova	Karin Knapp	Do you think the play should have stopped?	5658_2.q	44.0	0	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5658_3	I think it helped to me a bit the 10 minutes after the second set. That helped me a lot, because I think also we went to the locker room and we could cool down a little bit. That help a bit, but how I said, I think they should change some rules.	5658_3.a	2014-01-16	F	5658	Maria Sharapova	Karin Knapp	Did you ever feel like it was dangerous out there?	5658_3.q	44.0	0	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5658_4	Yeah, it's not easy to think this with Maria, but I think I played my game from the beginning to the end. I tried to hit, to make pressure, because that's what I have to do. And, yeah, there were two I think Maria served she made some double faults, but I think she played really, really good also the second serve. I tried to attack, and there were two returns out like this, and at the end she won, so... (Smiling).	5658_4.a	2014-01-16	F	5658	Maria Sharapova	Karin Knapp	You played a great game today. Did you feel like you had it in the bag in third set?	5658_4.q	44.0	0	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5658_5	Sorry?	5658_5.a	2014-01-16	F	5658	Maria Sharapova	Karin Knapp	What did you think about your shot on break point that hit the net and went over for you?	5658_5.q	44.0	0	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5658_6	I was lucky (smiling). I mean, but this is tennis. It's like this. They were, how you said, I was lucky there. I think if these two returns were not out like this but in, it could change, so... Luck. It's in the game, so...	5658_6.a	2014-01-16	F	5658	Maria Sharapova	Karin Knapp	On break point at 54, when you hit the return that hit the net and fell on her side to win the point.	5658_6.q	44.0	0	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5658_7	Yes, yes, it gave me confidence, because Maria is, I mean, in the three best players of the world. So I trying to find as much as possible these feelings and getting to play games like this all the time, and it gave me confidence, yes.	5658_7.a	2014-01-16	F	5658	Maria Sharapova	Karin Knapp	Do you take confidence moving forward after this performance today against Maria?	5658_7.q	44.0	0	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5658_8	No, that was a problem that I, how you say, resolve with two surgeries. But it's fine. I do just the controls every year for me, for myself, but that's all done, all fine.	5658_8.a	2014-01-16	F	5658	Maria Sharapova	Karin Knapp	How serious is the heart problem you had a couple years ago? How serious was that? Did you think you might not be able to keep playing?	5658_8.q	44.0	0	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5658_9	Yes, yes, of course, because you have to do two surgeries in your heart. They always going to touch your heart. But it was not easy. A lot of difficult moments. But I keep trying to get back, and I'm really happy.	5658_9.a	2014-01-16	F	5658	Maria Sharapova	Karin Knapp	At the time were you worried about whether it would affect your tennis and whether you'd be able to keep playing?	5658_9.q	44.0	0	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
2608_0	Well, you know, it's still the beginning of the season, you know. Let's say it was not an easy first-round match. She's a very good opponent. She plays very good. I had some good moments and bad moments, but overall I'm happy I went through, and I'm pretty satisfied with everything.	2608_0.a	2010-01-18	F	2608	Magdalena Rybarikova	Dinara Safina	How would you sum up your first-round match?	2608_0.q	2.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
2608_1	I mean, it was a solid game by me. Just from this I can start to build up much more confidence and using more my shots. So I think it was a very solid game from my side.	2608_1.a	2010-01-18	F	2608	Magdalena Rybarikova	Dinara Safina	What pleased you most about the match?	2608_1.q	2.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
2608_2	I'm feeling pretty good.	2608_2.a	2010-01-18	F	2608	Magdalena Rybarikova	Dinara Safina	Physically how are you feeling?	2608_2.q	2.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
2608_3	No, I was pretty confident because I spoke with my doctor back in -- he's in Germany. He told me like for Australia Open for sure I'm going to be hundred percent. Was doubting the tournaments before. But, you know, my recovery went pretty fast, so I was even ready for Sydney.	2608_3.a	2010-01-18	F	2608	Magdalena Rybarikova	Dinara Safina	A month ago did you expect to be here, or did you think physically maybe that wouldn't happen for you?	2608_3.q	2.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
2608_4	At that moment I just wanted to heal my injuries fast as possible. You know, that was the only thing. You know, it was unfortunate. It was disappointing end of the season that you have to retire. You do everything to get to the Masters, and then you cannot play because of the injury. So it was sad. But, you know, sometimes you cannot fight against the injury. So it was a good lesson that I have to be smarter and take much more care about myself. But, you know, I just had a good rest, and I was much more motivated for practices.	2608_4.a	2010-01-18	F	2608	Magdalena Rybarikova	Dinara Safina	When you left Doha at the end of the year, what were you thinking in general about your year and how it went?	2608_4.q	2.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
2608_5	Well, I can say only happy, you know. It was a great season. You know, I didn't make a Grand Slam. But, you know, I still won a big tournaments. I was again in two finals. So, you know, every year I'm doing better. So why I even have to be sad or something? I reach No.1 in the world. Some people never reach this and they have to finish their career. I did more than many people expected me to do, so I think it was a great season from my side.	2608_5.a	2010-01-18	F	2608	Magdalena Rybarikova	Dinara Safina	So in the off-season when you were thinking about 2009 last year, what were your general thoughts? Were you happy about it? Do you think there were some missed opportunities?	2608_5.q	2.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
2608_6	I think it's great for her that she's back.	2608_6.a	2010-01-18	F	2608	Magdalena Rybarikova	Dinara Safina	What do you think about the comeback of Justine Henin? You were the one who beat her, and now she's come back.	2608_6.q	2.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
2608_7	I guess so.	2608_7.a	2010-01-18	F	2608	Magdalena Rybarikova	Dinara Safina	And for women's tennis?	2608_7.q	2.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
2608_8	I think so, yeah. It is like much more competition. It's not anymore so easy if you are top 10 that you're going to win a match 6-Love, 6-Love. Nobody going to tank to you anymore. So they all -- the young ones, they all have no fear. They all deserve to beat you. So it's getting not easy. But, you know, that's why -- it's a competitive sport, you know. You have to push yourself and work on your weaknesses day to day. It's not the sport where you're the best, you just win by the name. No, you have to every day work.	2608_8.a	2010-01-18	F	2608	Magdalena Rybarikova	Dinara Safina	Sharapova said she thought this year would be maybe the most competitive in a long time because Kim comes back, Justine is back, some of the younger players are coming up, then all of you are in it. Do you agree?	2608_8.q	2.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
2608_9	Last year I was also motivated. I cannot say anything. Just I think at the end of the last year I was tired, exhausted, like I had no more fun on the court. But now I feel like I'm back and I'm, like, enjoying every moment on the court. That was missing a little bit last year. Last year I was every time like pushing myself, like, Okay, I have to do it. But now I do it with a much more desire.	2608_9.a	2010-01-18	F	2608	Magdalena Rybarikova	Dinara Safina	Would you say that you're more motivated coming in here than you were last year? How hard is it to maintain the same level of motivation year after year?	2608_9.q	2.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
2608_10	Weird. But from other hand, you know, it had to ended up. So somehow I was prepared. I knew it was not going to be forever. And I still get the same support, so it's good (smiling).	2608_10.a	2010-01-18	F	2608	Magdalena Rybarikova	Dinara Safina	So how is it to be out here now that your brother is no longer on tour?	2608_10.q	2.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5227_0	Yeah, she definitely played pretty well. Yeah, so am I happy? I guess. I'm happy to still be alive in the tournament, I guess. But, you know, I can always look to improve on some things.	5227_0.a	2013-10-23	F	5227	Agnieszka Radwanska	Serena Williams	Looked like it was a pretty good match from Radwanska tonight, but you were able to get through. Were you happy with your level of play and how you were out there?	5227_0.q	1.0	1	Round Robin	TEB BNP PARIBAS WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS	SEC
5227_1	My serve wasn't as good today as it was yesterday, but, you know, you can't expect it to be great every day.	5227_1.a	2013-10-23	F	5227	Agnieszka Radwanska	Serena Williams	What in particular were you less than happy with?	5227_1.q	1.0	1	Round Robin	TEB BNP PARIBAS WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS	SEC
5227_2	Yeah, each time is the first time. Each time is a different meaning. You know, tonight was just a new meaning. Obviously you have to keep motivated. You don't want to lose unless you know, if your opponent is playing well, it is what it is, but you always want to have a really good attitude to try to win.	5227_2.a	2013-10-23	F	5227	Agnieszka Radwanska	Serena Williams	How do you keep motivated against someone you have beaten seven times coming into this match and eight tonight?	5227_2.q	1.0	1	Round Robin	TEB BNP PARIBAS WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS	SEC
5227_3	Yeah, I feel like that every year at the end of the year. I think it's natural, normal, so yeah. I'm always feeling like that towards the end. You know, just like the last tournament, and then you just know in a couple of days you can be somewhere else, on a beach or, you know, in China, where you choose to go.	5227_3.a	2013-10-23	F	5227	Agnieszka Radwanska	Serena Williams	Azarenka was saying that she's mentally tired, end of the year, she's had to kind of push through things. Have you been at that stage in your career at the end of the year, it's tough to get motivated?	5227_3.q	1.0	1	Round Robin	TEB BNP PARIBAS WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS	SEC
5227_4	I don't know. I really don't know. I'm barely hanging on, but I don't know.	5227_4.a	2013-10-23	F	5227	Agnieszka Radwanska	Serena Williams	How do you keep your mind on the matches, then?	5227_4.q	1.0	1	Round Robin	TEB BNP PARIBAS WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS	SEC
5227_5	Yeah, it's similar to, you know, having match point. It's so close, but yet it's so far away. You have to kind of stay focused throughout the whole ordeal. It hasn't gotten easier any year, any year that I have played. But you've just got to, whatever, decide if you want to or not.	5227_5.a	2013-10-23	F	5227	Agnieszka Radwanska	Serena Williams	So does that help or hurt, knowing that, you know, it's the last of a push and you can push it to the limit here because you're going to get a break, or are you sort of thinking, wow, that break is tantalizingly close, and it's hard to keep it together?	5227_5.q	1.0	1	Round Robin	TEB BNP PARIBAS WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS	SEC
5227_6	Yeah, I'm definitely motivated. I don't want to come all this way to not do well, and, you know, I have a tough draw, so I just have to do the best I can.	5227_6.a	2013-10-23	F	5227	Agnieszka Radwanska	Serena Williams	A lot of selfexhortations there at the end of that second set. You still look like you're pretty hungry and pretty motivated.	5227_6.q	1.0	1	Round Robin	TEB BNP PARIBAS WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS	SEC
5227_7	Yeah, wow, I would not want to play Fed Cup after this. Who is in the final?	5227_7.a	2013-10-23	F	5227	Agnieszka Radwanska	Serena Williams	Talk about the schedule and how tough it is to stay focused now. Next week is the Fed Cup final, which a lot of players from the Russian side decided they don't want to play, they are too tired this time of year or something. Do you think the schedule, in regards to that, should be changed to make that a more accessible event for players? I know you're obviously not playing this year.	5227_7.q	1.0	1	Round Robin	TEB BNP PARIBAS WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS	SEC
5227_8	Oh, I would not want to play. With that being said, I really want to bring Fed Cup back to the United States, so next year, oh, my gosh. Oh, that's going to be tough.	5227_8.a	2013-10-23	F	5227	Agnieszka Radwanska	Serena Williams	Russia and Italy.	5227_8.q	1.0	1	Round Robin	TEB BNP PARIBAS WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS	SEC
5227_9	No. It is an issue sometimes, but look at the men. They have like seven more weeks before their Davis Cup final, so it could be worse.	5227_9.a	2013-10-23	F	5227	Agnieszka Radwanska	Serena Williams	Is it something where Fed Cup is an issue the players council has talked about?	5227_9.q	1.0	1	Round Robin	TEB BNP PARIBAS WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS	SEC
5227_10	No, I think it's fine. I think ending the year, I have always I have always traditionally ended my year after the Open. You guys are lucky that I was able to make it out two tournaments. That's like a record for me. I love that the season is getting, you know, getting shorter and shorter.	5227_10.a	2013-10-23	F	5227	Agnieszka Radwanska	Serena Williams	I guess all this begs the question, do you like the more compact schedule now when you guys are ending October 20something, or would you rather have a little bit more of a break after the US Open and push the season back into November?	5227_10.q	1.0	1	Round Robin	TEB BNP PARIBAS WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS	SEC
5227_11	Definitely play my game and do the best I can. She plays such a good game. She does everything well. She's just such a great player. Grand Slam winner. Definitely not an easy match for me. Not an easy match for her, either. But, you know, what happens happens.	5227_11.a	2013-10-23	F	5227	Agnieszka Radwanska	Serena Williams	Just a quick question about tomorrow's match against Petra. It's kind of a highly anticipated one between the both of you. When you go into a match against a player who hits as big as she does, mentally is there an adjustment that needs to be made, or are you still just, like, I'll just play my game and I'm good?	5227_11.q	1.0	1	Round Robin	TEB BNP PARIBAS WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS	SEC
4731_0	I feel really happy right now. It's been a long match. It's been a tough match. Li Na was absolutely playing great tennis. Unfortunate things that happened to her, you know, but that's sport. But, yeah, I'm just happy that everything I went through, you know, I still could manage to give my best and really come out there and try to focus on my game and play tennis that I can produce. And that's the thing that I love to do, is to compete.	4731_0.a	2013-01-26	F	4731	Na Li	Victoria Azarenka	You must be very happy with a long, tough match, and you had to deal with quite a bit with the injury timeouts and fireworks. How do you feel now?	4731_0.q	1.0	1	The Final	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4731_1	I think so. In these kind of matches you always have to take the opportunity of the important moments. In the second set, in the third set, that's what I was doing better. In the first set, she was really on top of me, I think, she was really going for her shots and making everything happen. Then I just had to readjust and really take advantage of when she gives me an opportunity.	4731_1.a	2013-01-26	F	4731	Na Li	Victoria Azarenka	Li Na said she felt you perhaps played better on the bigger games in the end. Is that how you feel the match was decided?	4731_1.q	1.0	1	The Final	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4731_2	You know, I never thought about it this way. My mentality was to come and try to win another title. That was my main goal. It was definitely not easy with all the attention, you know, with all the press around. But it was definitely new experience for me that I think I handled quite well, and I can only learn from this experience and moved on forward and try to improve as a player and as a person, as well.	4731_2.a	2013-01-26	F	4731	Na Li	Victoria Azarenka	How much more difficult is it coming into a slam defending the title?	4731_2.q	1.0	1	The Final	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4731_3	It isn't easy, that's for sure, but I knew what I had to do. I had to stay calm. I had to stay positive. I just had to deal with the things that came onto me. And that's pretty much it. I was actually really happy that I went through so many things knowing that I can still produce the tennis that I can and keep the focus that I can. It just motivates me to be a better player.	4731_3.a	2013-01-26	F	4731	Na Li	Victoria Azarenka	Was it difficult for you to get your head right going into the final, bearing in mind the talk of the last couple of days?	4731_3.q	1.0	1	The Final	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4731_4	I never thought about that. I never thought about the No.1 ranking. The pressure was there, but I like the pressure, you know. It's interesting. It's very interesting thing. It pushes you to be better. You can take it different way. You can take it negative and try to, you know, think negative. But I take it as a positive, something that will push me forward to improve, to get better, and the outcome is out of my hands. I just have to be really focused on what I do, very honest with what I do, and that's it.	4731_4.a	2013-01-26	F	4731	Na Li	Victoria Azarenka	Is this the most pressure you ever felt going into a match? Your No.1 ranking was up for grabs if you lost.	4731_4.q	1.0	1	The Final	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4731_5	She did, but I think I kind of didn't expect that. You always feel really bad for a player when something like this happens. I kind of I think lived with her that moment and completely forgot that I have to play tennis, you know, have to compete and make her run still. So tricked me a little bit. But, you know, it's my own fault for letting me trick that way. But I'm just glad on the second one I could keep my focus, keep my cool, and execute my shots.	4731_5.a	2013-01-26	F	4731	Na Li	Victoria Azarenka	Were you surprised with the way that Li Na bounced back after the two heavy falls?	4731_5.q	1.0	1	The Final	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4731_6	Never happened. Never happened.	4731_6.a	2013-01-26	F	4731	Na Li	Victoria Azarenka	A 10minute break for fireworks doesn't happen at every Grand Slam tournament.	4731_6.q	1.0	1	The Final	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4731_7	I don't know. Everybody can say broke up the momentum, it changed, it didn't. For me, I was just trying to stay focused and really be there in the moment when it's finished, because there's nothing you can do about it. I mean, everybody celebrates. It's happy day, Australia Day, everybody's happy. I wish I could see the fireworks, too, honestly. But I had to put some hot cream on me so I don't get cold.	4731_7.a	2013-01-26	F	4731	Na Li	Victoria Azarenka	Does that break up the momentum of the game to a certain degree?	4731_7.q	1.0	1	The Final	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4731_8	No, I went in the other room, where I was before, the match before, the exact same room. I put some hot cream on me because it was getting cold. I don't like to be cold. I was playing with the pants on and it was a little bit chilly out there, so that's all I did.	4731_8.a	2013-01-26	F	4731	Na Li	Victoria Azarenka	What did you do during the break? Did you go into the locker room?	4731_8.q	1.0	1	The Final	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4731_9	No. Actually, it wasn't. It was one track called Poppin' off in Atlanta. It was a dubstep mix. It has this video on YouTube or Vevo, I don't remember, and it has really, really cool dance, so I was imagining.	4731_9.a	2013-01-26	F	4731	Na Li	Victoria Azarenka	What was the music what you were listening to before you entered? Red Foo?	4731_9.q	1.0	1	The Final	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4731_10	Do you think I calculated? I had no idea (laughter). No, I had no idea really. It's just what happened. At 43 was a really close game. You know, she really did a lot of things. You know, I think it was a breakpoint, I was breakpoint down, and I stayed there. Honestly, I just wanted to play one point at a time. I didn't think two matches before, three matches before, four matches before. The US Open never crossed my mind. I was just really staying in the moment and trying to collect as many points as I can in this particular game and that was it.	4731_10.a	2013-01-26	F	4731	Na Li	Victoria Azarenka	Going into the 53 game in the third set where you served for it against Sloane, also thinking back to the US Open against Serena, you had a 53 lead, did you really have to focus on making sure you wanted to close it out returning instead of having to go and serve for it?	4731_10.q	1.0	1	The Final	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4731_11	No, that's not true, actually.	4731_11.a	2013-01-26	F	4731	Na Li	Victoria Azarenka	Why do you accept balls from the righthand side only?	4731_11.q	1.0	1	The Final	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4731_12	Yeah, particular side. I'm weird that way. It's like a stupid thing that you're blaming a ball boy. I'm losing a point, but that's not true. I always take from one side. If I start losing, I go to another side. I'm just changing. I'm just trying to adjust a little bit the situation, which completely doesn't make any sense, but helps me.	4731_12.a	2013-01-26	F	4731	Na Li	Victoria Azarenka	A particular side?	4731_12.q	1.0	1	The Final	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4731_13	I guess so.	4731_13.a	2013-01-26	F	4731	Na Li	Victoria Azarenka	Is it something superstitious?	4731_13.q	1.0	1	The Final	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4731_14	Well, I was expecting way worse, to be honest actually. What can you do? You just have to go out there and try to play tennis in the end of the day. That's what it was all about. It's a tennis match, tennis battle, final of the Australian Open. I was there to play that. The things what happened in the past, I did the best thing I could to explain, to do everything I could, and it was left behind me already. So when I went into the match, I was really focused on trying to play that particular match, the most important match of the tournament, That one thing that I just have to go and do, and that's it.	4731_14.a	2013-01-26	F	4731	Na Li	Victoria Azarenka	Were you worried about the reception you might get when you went on court at the beginning?	4731_14.q	1.0	1	The Final	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4731_15	I don't know. It's a completely different mix of feelings. This one is way more emotional. It's gonna be extra special for me, for sure. I never compare my wins or losses ever in any tournaments. It's just a matter of the feeling that you get, things you've been through, because you're the only one who knows what you've been going through these two weeks. So it's definitely an emotional one and it's going to be special. But to defend the title, it's a different one, for sure.	4731_15.a	2013-01-26	F	4731	Na Li	Victoria Azarenka	In the circumstances, do you actually derive greater satisfaction from retaining the title than you did actually winning it the first time last year?	4731_15.q	1.0	1	The Final	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4731_16	Everything. What happened with Sloane, it was a big deal, for sure. It came out as a big deal. It wasn't a big deal on the court. But I take it as a great learning experience and just try to live the moment and take the best things out of what happened and move forward. But emotionally, there were a lot of things. Like the match I had in the third round, it was really tough to battle through. So two weeks is very difficult to keep your cool, because it seems in one way so short, but in another way it seems so long. So you just have to kind of try to manage everything. But I think the whole world knows I'm an emotional player now.	4731_16.a	2013-01-26	F	4731	Na Li	Victoria Azarenka	Was it emotional just because of what happened with Sloane or are there other reasons why it's so emotional?	4731_16.q	1.0	1	The Final	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4731_17	I don't know really. I don't know. I hope so. But that's out of my hands really. I was just there to try to be the best tennis player there is, to do the best job as I can and show great tennis. I cannot go back in time. I couldn't go forward in time. I can just execute and be there and take control of what I can. I've done that and I'm really proud of that.	4731_17.a	2013-01-26	F	4731	Na Li	Victoria Azarenka	Do you think the way things happened tonight with the break and with Li Na's tumbling a couple of times, the way you handled that situation, that you've won back some fans that might have been skeptical after the last match?	4731_17.q	1.0	1	The Final	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4731_18	Well, I learned how to talk a lot on TV. Way more than any win I ever got (laughter). But, you know, it's just a pressure of something that you have to explain. You have to keep going, kind of make everybody believe you, because nobody did at the beginning. Just trying to be honest really for about a hundred times in a row. That's different.	4731_18.a	2013-01-26	F	4731	Na Li	Victoria Azarenka	You said the semifinal was a learning experience. What did you learn?	4731_18.q	1.0	1	The Final	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4731_19	I hope so. I really do.	4731_19.a	2013-01-26	F	4731	Na Li	Victoria Azarenka	Have you got some sort of guarantee from your support crew in the box that they're going to follow you around to a few more slams?	4731_19.q	1.0	1	The Final	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4731_20	If I'm going to text him?	4731_20.a	2013-01-26	F	4731	Na Li	Victoria Azarenka	Last year you won and Novak won the men's. In the end of the year, you both claimed the top spot. Are you going to text him something about that?	4731_20.q	1.0	1	The Final	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4731_21	Can you give me his phone number, then I'll do that (laughter)? I don't have his phone number, honestly.	4731_21.a	2013-01-26	F	4731	Na Li	Victoria Azarenka	Yes.	4731_21.q	1.0	1	The Final	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4731_22	You know, when I came first on the tour I kind of was lost a little bit. I didn't know how to open up my personality. It's very difficult when you're alone. I was independent since I was, you know, 10 years old. I went first time to the States when I was 10 years old. It was a little bit scary and I wouldn't show my personality. So the whole couple of years I learned how to open up to people and to share the moments with them and how to talk to you guys, as well. I wasn't really good before. I hope I got better. It's your judgment, but... That's my thing, is to show the personality that I really have, you know, outside the court as well. Because on the court I'm really focused, I'm really determined, I'm going to do the job that I have, and I'm going to have the face that I have, and I'm going to be the way that I have to be to be the better tennis player. But off court I'm a different person a little bit.	4731_22.a	2013-01-26	F	4731	Na Li	Victoria Azarenka	You said at the very start you learned to become a better player and person. You said before about being honest. Is that what you're talking about when you say being a better person?	4731_22.q	1.0	1	The Final	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3627_0	Doesn't start with tennis. Somewhere around the golf course, his basketball game maybe. Mostly his golf game because he likes to play a lot golf. I've played my entire life, so I got a few years ahead of him. But it definitely doesn't have anything to do with tennis.	3627_0.a	2011-03-30	M	3627	David Ferrer	Mardy Fish	When you trash talk Andy Roddick, how does it go?	3627_0.q	15.0	1	Quarterfinals	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters 1000
3627_1	Yeah. I mean, I don't know. You know, I've never been in this position before. Obviously it's very humbling. This is a pretty big country, a lot of people playing tennis. So I'll try to put it into perspective, and I will. No.11, career high No.11 sounds really good, too. You know, these are the rewards that come with working as hard as I did.	3627_1.a	2011-03-30	M	3627	David Ferrer	Mardy Fish	So this subject is off limits between you two?	3627_1.q	15.0	1	Quarterfinals	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters 1000
3627_2	You know, I was who I was when I was 21 and 24 and 23. You know, there's just not one ounce in my body that goes back to the past. I had some really good results. I won a silver medal at the Olympics. There's not very many people that have done that. I mean, I did a lot of cool things. I played a lot of good matches. You know, you can't be as mature at 21 as you are now, as I am now. Never look back.	3627_2.a	2011-03-30	M	3627	David Ferrer	Mardy Fish	Is there a part of you that kind of says, Gee, maybe I'm sorry I didn't work this hard a bunch of years ago, what I might have missed, or you can't look back?	3627_2.q	15.0	1	Quarterfinals	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters 1000
3627_3	No, I just assumed -- obviously he missed a lot more, especially in the second set, than he normally does. I thought he played fine in the first set. I was fighting; he was fighting me off a little bit. We were into a battle there at 5-All. Basically double faulted twice in a row at deuce to give me the game. The conditions were -- conditions in a sense that the ball is not exactly where you want it to be with the wind like that. So you know going out there -- and I've played in these conditions hundreds of times, thousands of times more than he has just because I practiced in it almost every day growing up. You know you're not going to play well going out there. I know that in the back of my mind. Not nearly as well as I played yesterday, because the ball is not going to be in the position I want it to be in, the wind might take the ball longer or shorter than yesterday, and you're not going to be as dialed in. I knew that. I tried to use it to my advantage.	3627_3.a	2011-03-30	M	3627	David Ferrer	Mardy Fish	Did you suspect David was ailing in any way? Didn't seem like his usual self out there.	3627_3.q	15.0	1	Quarterfinals	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters 1000
3627_4	Yeah, I think they put in my charity event program -- no, they put in a magazine an article of my foundation this year, like a picture from 2006. I was pretty pissed off about that. (Smiling.) Didn't look like me really anymore. But my dad was trying to convince me that it was all about the kids. (Smiling.)	3627_4.a	2011-03-30	M	3627	David Ferrer	Mardy Fish	Do you watch old videos or whatever, tapes of yourself as a player? Can you just talk about how you looked as a player then and what you're doing now?	3627_4.q	15.0	1	Quarterfinals	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters 1000
3627_5	Yeah, I mean, look, I had to go for different -- I had to play differently. You know, there were matches when I felt good, and I could always play in the heat pretty well, but I could never really last that long. So, yeah, there comes -- with fitness comes a mental edge for sure that I used to never have.	3627_5.a	2011-03-30	M	3627	David Ferrer	Mardy Fish	Even your style of play, forgetting about the physical...	3627_5.q	15.0	1	Quarterfinals	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters 1000
3627_6	Never. I'm in a quarterfinals of a Masters Series. I've been in the quarterfinals now four times in Masters Series, and I've won every quarterfinal match and every semifinal match that I've been in this Masters Series. I would like to be there more, put myself in that position more often. But, no, I never thought it about it once during the match.	3627_6.a	2011-03-30	M	3627	David Ferrer	Mardy Fish	During the match, were you at all thinking about this No.11 situation? If so, how much of it were you able to put out of your mind?	3627_6.q	15.0	1	Quarterfinals	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters 1000
3627_7	I haven't looked yet, but I'm sure. I mean, not only these guys colleagues and people that we play against week in and week out, these are my best friends. So put them in this position I would be extremely excited for them, and hopefully they for me, too.	3627_7.a	2011-03-30	M	3627	David Ferrer	Mardy Fish	Did you receive any messages from your fellow American colleagues?	3627_7.q	15.0	1	Quarterfinals	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters 1000
3627_8	Ferrer?	3627_8.a	2011-03-30	M	3627	David Ferrer	Mardy Fish	I know it's tough to comment or analyze another guy's game, but this guy has been really consistent and his ranking is way up there in the top 10.	3627_8.q	15.0	1	Quarterfinals	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters 1000
3627_9	No, this guy's got some solid results. He's got results on every surface. I think he's made the quarterfinals of Wimbledon. He's put himself in the semifinals of Australia and the US Open at different times. He's got tournament wins on clay, on indoor hardcourts, fast courts, slow courts, doesn't matter. The guy is one of the fittest guys in the world in any sport. Guy can run forever. You know, he battles and plays hard. You respect the heck out of him just the way he plays. He's one of my favorite players to watch. Fights for everything. There's nothing -- he doesn't go out and blow anybody off the court. I respect the heck out of his career. It's tough to play like that. You've got to be real strong.	3627_9.a	2011-03-30	M	3627	David Ferrer	Mardy Fish	Yeah. But he seems to have trouble punching through it even at Masters Series level.	3627_9.q	15.0	1	Quarterfinals	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters 1000
3627_10	I didn't see him do that. I obviously know that it's going on. He'd probably take that one back if he could. He's a very nice guy. Obviously flustered.	3627_10.a	2011-03-30	M	3627	David Ferrer	Mardy Fish	In the second set he's obviously struggling and the match is getting away from him. When he lobs the ball at the crying baby, what was your reaction?	3627_10.q	15.0	1	Quarterfinals	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters 1000
3627_11	Yeah, I mean, he stopped. There was a lot people in the crowd. It's going to happen.	3627_11.a	2011-03-30	M	3627	David Ferrer	Mardy Fish	He didn't hit it that hard.	3627_11.q	15.0	1	Quarterfinals	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters 1000
3627_12	Yeah, I mean, it's pretty incredible, to be honest. Watching him play and the way that he's played, it's not that -- I mean, he's playing so well. He has zero weaknesses right now. Obviously confidence is a huge part of our sport, and he's got all of it right now. Guy moves as good or better than anyone on a hardcourt surface. You know, sometimes if you get really, really picky, his forehand isn't as strong as his backhand. He's hitting his forehand as good as anyone in the world. His backhand, two-handed backhand is the best two-handed backhand in my opinion in the world. And he's serving well again. He had some serving trouble there for a little bit, maybe last year at this time. He's certainly rectified that. So it's not -- to be honest, it's really not that surprising when you watch him play that he hasn't lost yet, because he's playing so well. He's not going to win every single match this year. Whether it be this week or in July, he's not going to win every one. It's just not possible. So hopefully it can be me.	3627_12.a	2011-03-30	M	3627	David Ferrer	Mardy Fish	I want to ask about the potential of Djokovic, if you were to play him. Talk about what he's doing this year.	3627_12.q	15.0	1	Quarterfinals	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters 1000
3627_13	Yeah, I mean, look, I've served well over my career. I served 43 aces in one two-out-of-three-set match. I've served well before. But to be able to be confident enough to not have to press as much is key. I can get free points on my serve; I know that. But then when the shot's not there, I don't have to press. I don't have to go for too much. I didn't know how I was going to feel coming into today, especially having such a hard-fought match yesterday. It was hot and humid yesterday. I just haven't played in those conditions in a long time. That was partly the problem there in the end. Just tried to hydrate as much as I could and get back - long-winded answer - I was able to get free points today and save myself a little bit. That's huge.	3627_13.a	2011-03-30	M	3627	David Ferrer	Mardy Fish	Speaking of serving, have you ever felt more confident on your serve, first or second?	3627_13.q	15.0	1	Quarterfinals	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters 1000
3627_14	Well, look, I tend to overserve. I served 37% first-serve percentage against Gasquet. I know he's a very good returner, and so sometimes in the back of your mind you're trying to overserve and hit it that much -- too hard. So we worked on that. We had a day off after that match and did a lot serving. We worked on the ball toss. We worked on trying to -- I mean, you're almost like a pitcher. If you have a good serve and you want to -- or if you have a serve that can win you free points, especially against someone like him that can lock in on the return and put every single one back -- Novak won't be any different than that, or better. So I'll have to mix up speed, spins, kicks, flats, hard, slice, all that stuff, just to keep him off balance.	3627_14.a	2011-03-30	M	3627	David Ferrer	Mardy Fish	You're mixing it up real well. You're hitting an ace and you look at the clock and you see that it's nowhere near the max service speed. Is it your spin? Is it your placement?	3627_14.q	15.0	1	Quarterfinals	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters 1000
3627_15	Yeah, that's a huge goal. I've been pretty vocal about that basically since last summer. Close, I guess. Every match, every point that I get, that's the goal.	3627_15.a	2011-03-30	M	3627	David Ferrer	Mardy Fish	Obviously No.11, you're flirting with top 10. Is that a goal for you?	3627_15.q	15.0	1	Quarterfinals	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters 1000
3627_16	He's beaten him before. He's beaten him here before.	3627_16.a	2011-03-30	M	3627	David Ferrer	Mardy Fish	I want to ask on the off chance that Kevin Anderson were to win...	3627_16.q	15.0	1	Quarterfinals	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters 1000
3627_17	No, he's a guy that serves extremely well. Great athlete for his size. He's played well this year. He's won a tournament in South Africa. Had some good results and beat some good players this week, you know, so he'll give him some trouble. You got to get free points against Novak. If you don't, he's going to win most groundstroke rallies. You got to get to the net. He likes to come to the net a little bit. You can't just loop the ball around the court against him. Like I said, he moves too well and he's too solid right now. I would expect him to give him some trouble. That being said, he could go out there and beat him 1-1. The guy's playing so well.	3627_17.a	2011-03-30	M	3627	David Ferrer	Mardy Fish	Yeah, and no one is talking about him. Talk about Kevin.	3627_17.q	15.0	1	Quarterfinals	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters 1000
3627_18	Sometimes it's the score. Sometimes it's a position where, you know, maybe I'm up in the score and I just want to plant that small seed that you can't just keep bringing the ball back on the return with ease. If you do, I'm going to come in and try to put it away. I have my patterns, like everybody else does, but I'm trying to keep an aggressive -- I'm an aggressive style of player. I can play better defense than I used to because of my fitness, and I can rely on that sometimes. But I have to keep the mentality of staying aggressive, and that helps a lot.	3627_18.a	2011-03-30	M	3627	David Ferrer	Mardy Fish	What triggers the decision to serve and volley suddenly? Is it the score? The moment?	3627_18.q	15.0	1	Quarterfinals	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters 1000
3627_19	Yeah, I mean, it only helps, obviously. Like I said before, confidence is such a huge part of our sport. Obviously I'm still here, but I'd love to do well on the clay. I like playing on it. I've won a tournament on it, and I haven't had huge results if Europe, but I feel like I can do well, be seeded in those events now, which helps. I don't have to play somebody in the top 15 in the world in the first two rounds. I've won matches there. I was close in the French Open. Lost 10-8 in the fifth to Ljubicic in the second round. So I've won matches there. I'm very much looking forward to hopefully being healthy and playing a full clay court season and seeing how well I can do there.	3627_19.a	2011-03-30	M	3627	David Ferrer	Mardy Fish	On the points of confidence and motivation, what you've achieved over here, how much more confidence and motivation do you think it's going to provide you with?	3627_19.q	15.0	1	Quarterfinals	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters 1000
3627_20	Maybe. I never thought about it like that. I'm assuming that with as many matches he's played he's pretty fit as well. I love playing in the heat. I can't speak for him. I'm not sure of his results off the top of my head. I think, you know, he's won Canada before, but I don't think he's ever won Cincinnati. It's as hot in Cincinnati as it is anywhere. I can't speak for him. It's a good question. I know how much I enjoy playing in it. It speeds the court up pretty good for me. Playing during the day here and playing at night are two completely different tournaments, so hopefully we can play during the day.	3627_20.a	2011-03-30	M	3627	David Ferrer	Mardy Fish	Going back to Djokovic for one second, you said at the moment he has no weaknesses. One of them has that he doesn't perform that well in heat. You said you grew up playing in this kind of climate. Do you think that could be a weakness now?	3627_20.q	15.0	1	Quarterfinals	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters 1000
3627_21	Well, just from my family living in Vero Beach, and my best friends still live there. Still have a lot have friends down in Boca. Friends here in Miami. So it's always fun coming down here. And playing in Delray Beach, I usually try to get there every year. You know, so family and best friends are my ties, I guess.	3627_21.a	2011-03-30	M	3627	David Ferrer	Mardy Fish	I know that you grew up around Vero and all that. What are your South Florida ties now?	3627_21.q	15.0	1	Quarterfinals	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters 1000
3627_22	I would, yeah. I would prefer to play in hot weather. You know, I would prefer to play in humid weather. Probably 80% of it is because I know how to react in it and act in it and how to handle it. 20% is probably because I know the other guy doesn't like it as much as I do. That's a mental thing.	3627_22.a	2011-03-30	M	3627	David Ferrer	Mardy Fish	Would you rather play in the heat?	3627_22.q	15.0	1	Quarterfinals	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters 1000
3627_23	I request day matches in every single tournament.	3627_23.a	2011-03-30	M	3627	David Ferrer	Mardy Fish	You requested day matches for the whole tournament?	3627_23.q	15.0	1	Quarterfinals	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters 1000
3627_24	Back seat is a strong word with him. He's very active in my career. Coaching-wise he's taken a back seat. He's very helpful and been a huge part of my success. He's extremely supportive, extremely positive. That's been a huge help with me over the years. He's sort of had the approach of learn on your own kind of thing. I'll help you in any way I can, but if you're going to make mistakes, you're going to make your mistakes and figure it out on your own. So he's certainly been at the top of the list as far as my success goes.	3627_24.a	2011-03-30	M	3627	David Ferrer	Mardy Fish	Your dad's one of the few parents who have qualified to be like a coach or mentor, be hands-on, yet they've always seemed to take a -- he and your mom -- a back seat.	3627_24.q	15.0	1	Quarterfinals	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters 1000
3627_25	No, we've known each other for a long time. He's a huge tennis fan. He has a good game on his own. He's probably the best golfing tennis player. Put golf and tennis together, I think I got him, though. And you can tell him I said that.	3627_25.a	2011-03-30	M	3627	David Ferrer	Mardy Fish	Sergio Garcia a new buddy?	3627_25.q	15.0	1	Quarterfinals	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters 1000
3627_26	Yeah, and he's played tennis with us. He hit with Querrey the other day. He loves it. He'll be out there again on Friday.	3627_26.a	2011-03-30	M	3627	David Ferrer	Mardy Fish	Have you golfed with him?	3627_26.q	15.0	1	Quarterfinals	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters 1000
2736_0	I'm alive. I'm here. 17 hours later. Quite happy.	2736_0.a	2010-08-27	M	2736	nan	Sergiy Stakhovsky	You feeling it after playing three matches in two days?	2736_0.q	47.0	1	Semifinals	PILOT PEN TENNIS AT YALE	ATP250
2736_1	Well, definitely give me some confidence before the finals to play such a good tennis today. Obviously to the upcoming Grand Slam also, not so bad result the week before.	2736_1.a	2010-08-27	M	2736	nan	Sergiy Stakhovsky	Must feel good, heading to where you're going now?	2736_1.q	47.0	1	Semifinals	PILOT PEN TENNIS AT YALE	ATP250
2736_2	Well, I played four semifinals in total and I won all of them. Definitely today I played one of the best matches I could play in the semis. I think it's the only -- no. I did 's-Hertogenbosch also in two. It's one of two matches I did won in two sets in semifinals and I did play really good. I think this is the only match I didn't face a breakpoint at all, if I'm right.	2736_2.a	2010-08-27	M	2736	nan	Sergiy Stakhovsky	You've won three times. What would a win mean here? Where would you that rank amongst your other victories on the tour?	2736_2.q	47.0	1	Semifinals	PILOT PEN TENNIS AT YALE	ATP250
2736_3	It was actually a big turnover for me because he was serving really well and I was holding my serve quite strong. It was always about the small points. You could see this in the second set when I get a breakpoint, I get three aces in a row. So he was taking it really easy from me. I was really lucky to catch that return. I mean, I guess I just decided where he was serving, so I went for it. It went in, thanks God. It was a really important point for me. I close out the set with my serve and started fresh from the second.	2736_3.a	2010-08-27	M	2736	nan	Sergiy Stakhovsky	I think there was only one breakpoint in the first set and you took advantage of it. How important was that game to how the match turned out?	2736_3.q	47.0	1	Semifinals	PILOT PEN TENNIS AT YALE	ATP250
2736_4	Well, I can't say that I was serving as heavy as I did yesterday or as fast as I did serve yesterday, but it had more consistency and it done a lot of damage to him, not to his return, but him, and helped me a lot today.	2736_4.a	2010-08-27	M	2736	nan	Sergiy Stakhovsky	Can you talk about your serve today. Was it as good as you've had it this year?	2736_4.q	47.0	1	Semifinals	PILOT PEN TENNIS AT YALE	ATP250
2736_5	I can say the second maybe more, that I'm playing better in the end of the tournament. But that's a problem that not always you can get there. You need to struggle in the beginning. I did won all three titles starting from the semis. But, you know, every single match at that time was really different. I mean, Ljubicic in 2008 was a big impact on me because I was ranked 200 something, coming as a lucky loser to beat the home titleist. I mean, it was huge. The last year, St. Petersburg, was also not easy because I was coming from quallies. I won from a match point, third-set tiebreak which was a really long match and really exhausting. This year, 's-Hertogenbosch was 50 something minutes final against Tipsarevic. It was really quick. I was playing really good. I can't really say what it takes. It just takes I don't know what, but I'm trying to get that (smiling).	2736_5.a	2010-08-27	M	2736	nan	Sergiy Stakhovsky	In the past three times you reached the semifinals, you won all of those tournaments. Is there a different mentality in the later rounds or a reason you improve so much towards the end?	2736_5.q	47.0	1	Semifinals	PILOT PEN TENNIS AT YALE	ATP250
2736_6	It's not bizarre actually. If you take his life, I mean, in any other single country, if he would live, he would more or less be a billionaire or whatever, one of the biggest men in the world. Unfortunately he was living in Russia and doing the job he was supposed to do. He done it for his country. Basically is on a government salary, which is not huge. I know, okay, he done more damage to the world than he maybe done the good. But at some point he did save the country I was born in. I feel I have to be thankful to him.	2736_6.a	2010-08-27	M	2736	nan	Sergiy Stakhovsky	You're not exactly a household name around here. Looking on your website for information about you to share for readers, I have a couple questions. You listed the top five people you would bring to a party if you were allowed to, and they were Bono, Tom Hanks, Princess Diana, Boris Yeltsin and a Russian arms dealer. Where did he come from, the guy who created the AK-47? Kind of bizarre.	2736_6.q	47.0	1	Semifinals	PILOT PEN TENNIS AT YALE	ATP250
2736_7	Yeah, I try to do a lot of reading. Unfortunately, I don't like to read it on the computer, these tabloids, I don't know how you call it. I really prefer books and books are hard to travel with because they're heavy. When you're heading out for four weeks, you can't really take a lot of books because you have to take six pairs of tennis shoes. So books are going fast. I have to watch more movies now. I do prefer reading, and I do prefer being at home because being on the road all year round is not easy, so whatever time I have I try to spend at home.	2736_7.a	2010-08-27	M	2736	nan	Sergiy Stakhovsky	It says your perfect day would be to spend it with your girlfriend, hanging out with friends, a restful evening at home reading. Is reading something that you're that passionate about?	2736_7.q	47.0	1	Semifinals	PILOT PEN TENNIS AT YALE	ATP250
2736_8	I think I'm not the one to judge about this. I'm just trying to do my best on court. If it's going to bring me a name, it's going to be good. If it's not, I'm still going to try to do my job as good as I can.	2736_8.a	2010-08-27	M	2736	nan	Sergiy Stakhovsky	You have three tournaments now in a couple years. Do you feel you're almost there where you're going to take the next step?	2736_8.q	47.0	1	Semifinals	PILOT PEN TENNIS AT YALE	ATP250
2736_9	It definitely at some point is, but unfortunately I'm missing this consistency which can bring me a little higher than I am, and I'm looking for it.	2736_9.a	2010-08-27	M	2736	nan	Sergiy Stakhovsky	Do you feel your game is at that next level where you're almost with the elite?	2736_9.q	47.0	1	Semifinals	PILOT PEN TENNIS AT YALE	ATP250
3585_0	Well, you know, with these young players -- I played Sloane Stephens last week also, and it's a tough battle. It was also the same, almost. It's a very tough battle in the beginning. And then somehow, you know, they drop in intensity, because they are not used to playing these matches on this level all the time. They are normally playing challengers. But it's not a matter, you know, of strokes or of talent. I think she has it all. It's just a matter of, you know, playing these matches on this level all the time every week, every day. I think that's just the difference. Then when she, you know, took up her intensity, it was already too late, but it's -- I don't think there is like a huge difference, you know.	3585_0.a	2011-08-09	F	3585	Eugenie Bouchard	Andrea Petkovic	After trading breaks early in the first set, you took control of the match, basically. What changed?	3585_0.q	10.0	1	1st Round	ROGERS CUP WOMEN	Premier
3585_1	Yeah, I have been struggling a little bit with my body after -- I was sick in San Diego. I had a virus, and I'm a little bit struggling. The muscles, they feel drained and really tired. So when I jumped for one serve, I pulled a little bit my muscle, I think. But it's nothing, you know, it's nothing serious. It's just the normal things when you play a lot of matches that a tennis player has to go through. But, yeah, that's all.	3585_1.a	2011-08-09	F	3585	Eugenie Bouchard	Andrea Petkovic	Can you comment on how you were feeling at the beginning of the first set? Looked like you were grabbing your thigh or something.	3585_1.q	10.0	1	1st Round	ROGERS CUP WOMEN	Premier
3585_2	It was a stomach virus, yeah.	3585_2.a	2011-08-09	F	3585	Eugenie Bouchard	Andrea Petkovic	Was the virus last week just an ordinary stomach virus?	3585_2.q	10.0	1	1st Round	ROGERS CUP WOMEN	Premier
3585_3	Well, it's just a matter -- I was sharing room with my sister back in San Diego and she also had it. It's just a virus that was for two days, and I felt terrible the two days. But now I feel much better. It's just -- you know, I lost a lot of energy through all the, yeah, energy loss. Now I just have to regain it. I try to eat a lot, but my stomach is still a little bit irritated. So I cannot eat big portions, so I just have to eat many times a day. I'm still struggling a little bit, but it's not -- as I said, I feel fine. I just need some time to recover fully again.	3585_3.a	2011-08-09	F	3585	Eugenie Bouchard	Andrea Petkovic	Are you still feeling it?	3585_3.q	10.0	1	1st Round	ROGERS CUP WOMEN	Premier
3585_4	Well, at first I thought it was food poisoning from the food there, because Agnieszka, I played her in the semis, she told me that she also didn't feel so well. But now I think it was just some kind of virus that was going around there, because it was a closed resort, because my sister also had it and Aga didn't feel so well. So I think it was some kind of two days' virus that went around. Yeah, it was bad luck, but better now than at the US Open, so I think it's okay.	3585_4.a	2011-08-09	F	3585	Eugenie Bouchard	Andrea Petkovic	Did you ever figure out what it was? Something that you...	3585_4.q	10.0	1	1st Round	ROGERS CUP WOMEN	Premier
3585_5	Well, it's always important to come to the Grand Slams with a lot of confidence. For example, the French Open I played quarters, and right before I won the tournament in Strasbourg. It's just a matter of, you know, feeling well, feeling the balls, feeling the surface, and it's a balance, you know. You have to try to play as well as possible but also balance it with not playing too much, so that's why I don't play -- right before the US Open, I don't play a tournament. It's a balance of trying to win as many match as possible, but also recovering to be 100% at the US Open. But I think I have a good schedule, and, yeah, I hope it's gonna go on well.	3585_5.a	2011-08-09	F	3585	Eugenie Bouchard	Andrea Petkovic	How much are these warmups at the US Open going to play a role into how well you actually play there?	3585_5.q	10.0	1	1st Round	ROGERS CUP WOMEN	Premier
3585_6	Well, you know, it's just -- I always compare to myself when I was 17. I was also -- you know, when you are young, sometimes in the juniors you win a lot of matches by just, you know, putting a lot of balls in, just putting more balls in than the others. But when I was young, I was always trying to go for it. I might have lost matches that I shouldn't have lost, but I always said, you know, I had a good attitude, I wanted to win every match, and I wanted to win it by myself. I didn't want to get it -- I didn't want to take it from the other one because the other one was playing bad. I felt with Sloane also and with Eugenie today, I just feel they were courageous out on the court. They had the right attitude. She stayed positive, as positive as she could, even though she lost, I don't know, 10 or 11 games in a row. She stayed positive. And both, also Sloane, she had a very good attitude, and I think that's sometimes more important than the technique on court. But also they have, you know, strong balls. With 17, 18, 19, to have such strong balls it's already, you know, a good sign of, yeah, talent.	3585_6.a	2011-08-09	F	3585	Eugenie Bouchard	Andrea Petkovic	You mentioned played Sloane last week. And now Eugenie this week. How do you compare the two? When you sort of have a young player coming up, what are the things that tell you whether or not she's going to be good?	3585_6.q	10.0	1	1st Round	ROGERS CUP WOMEN	Premier
3585_7	Well, I am in the top 10 already. I am 10.	3585_7.a	2011-08-09	F	3585	Eugenie Bouchard	Andrea Petkovic	I assume you have a top 10 goal for this year, to get into the top 10. How are you going to get there? You're getting so close now.	3585_7.q	10.0	1	1st Round	ROGERS CUP WOMEN	Premier
3585_8	For the Championships? Yeah, it's really tough. At the beginning of the year, my goal was to be top 20 by the end of the year, and now it's August and I'm top 10. So I already surpassed my goals for the year, actually. But of course I think I'm 10th or 11th in the race. So of course that would be a dream come true. But it's really tough, because Petra Kvitova, Marion Bartoli are right in front of me. They are really -- they have a lot of points more than I have. So I really have to be focused now on each and every tournament trying to play well and try to surpass them. It's gonna be really, really tough, but I'm gonna try my best, try to keep up the intensity and improve, and sooner or later it will come. If it's this year or not, I don't know. But I really hope so, because every year I played the tournament Istanbul and I enjoyed myself so much. So I really hope I can make it until the end of the year.	3585_8.a	2011-08-09	F	3585	Eugenie Bouchard	Andrea Petkovic	Sorry, for the top 8 for the WTA...	3585_8.q	10.0	1	1st Round	ROGERS CUP WOMEN	Premier
3585_9	Yeah, it was a strange feeling, you know. Because they already told me the week before that I'm gonna be top 10 because Sam lost some points, Stosur, she lost some points. It was a good feeling. But on the other hand, I felt a little pressure in San Diego, I have to say, in Carlsbad, because I didn't want to go in the top 10, you know, just because somebody handed it to me. So I really felt like I have to play well, and after I reached the semis I felt much better. Unfortunately we didn't have any time to celebrate, but I think after Cincinnati I have a week off. I'm gonna grab a beer with my coach and that's gonna be it. Unfortunately not here, because I hear you have really good beer here in Canada. That's okay. I will come back.	3585_9.a	2011-08-09	F	3585	Eugenie Bouchard	Andrea Petkovic	When you hit top 10 this week, did it feel like a big milestone?	3585_9.q	10.0	1	1st Round	ROGERS CUP WOMEN	Premier
3585_10	Oh, well, I bought an iPad and I have like 10,000 books on the iPad. So I just skip between five or ten books, I had a little nap, and that was actually -- I'm still a little bit caught in the time difference with Carlsbad, which is three hours early, right? So I was still -- you know, I had to wake up at 7:00 because I thought I'm gonna play at 11:00, so the first three or four hours I was not really there. So that was okay. It went by really fast.	3585_10.a	2011-08-09	F	3585	Eugenie Bouchard	Andrea Petkovic	What did you do to kill time during the rain delay?	3585_10.q	10.0	1	1st Round	ROGERS CUP WOMEN	Premier
3585_11	Yeah, they have high expectations, you know, but first of all, it made my life much easier that we have now two other really, really good players with Julia and Sabine who are playing great tennis and who are still also at the beginning of their road. So that makes it much easier for me, you know, not being the only one. After Miami I had big trouble because I was the only one in the focus. Julia and Sabine hadn't played so well until then. So it was a lot of pressure I wasn't used to. Now, with Julia and Sabine, the life is much easier because it's somehow, you know, the pressure is on three backs so it's much easier. And on the other hand, I'm quite -- you know, I'm quite, how do you say? I'm quite well aware of my personality and my character. I know that I'm never going to be a Steffi Graf, just because we are so different. And I also think I have very high expectations on myself. So I think it's okay that your country has the high expectations if you have the high expectations the same. I also have high expectations to Germany, so they can have high expectations on myself.	3585_11.a	2011-08-09	F	3585	Eugenie Bouchard	Andrea Petkovic	One of the things I've always admired about you is that you seem to let pressure rub off your back. When I saw you in Miami I loved when you did the Petko Dance and a few other things. But I want to ask you on a more serious level, now that you're in the top 10, I want to know, in Germany, the expectations are for you to be another Steffi Graf. And coming from a country that had both Boris Becker and Steffi Graf, are you hounded by the German media when you're going to be No.1 in the world?	3585_11.q	10.0	1	1st Round	ROGERS CUP WOMEN	Premier
3585_12	Well, right now I'm reading the Thoughts of Roman Emperor, Marc Aurelius. Do you know that? It's philosophy. Doesn't help at all. Shouldn't read it before a match, but I try. (Laughter.)	3585_12.a	2011-08-09	F	3585	Eugenie Bouchard	Andrea Petkovic	What were you reading earlier?	3585_12.q	10.0	1	1st Round	ROGERS CUP WOMEN	Premier
3585_13	Yes.	3585_13.a	2011-08-09	F	3585	Eugenie Bouchard	Andrea Petkovic	You're playing doubles with Ana again this week?	3585_13.q	10.0	1	1st Round	ROGERS CUP WOMEN	Premier
3585_14	Yeah, definitely. I actually practiced with her a couple of times in Carlsbad, and we had some good hits. I just feel, you know, she feels much safer around her new coaching, you know, the coaching changes she has. I feel like she's much more stable now. I think she feels really, really well with Nigel and Scott, and so I had a good feeling and good vibe in the team already when we were practicing. And then she played semis as well in Carlsbad, and we were chatting a lot. She's very relaxed right now. So I think she's gonna do well here in the hard court season for sure.	3585_14.a	2011-08-09	F	3585	Eugenie Bouchard	Andrea Petkovic	Looks like she's starting to play better and find some consistent form. Is that something you sense playing alongside her?	3585_14.q	10.0	1	1st Round	ROGERS CUP WOMEN	Premier
5190_0	Yeah, I played good at the beginning. Came out playing well. She raised her level and she played some pretty good tennis. In the end she just played a little bit better.	5190_0.a	2013-03-25	F	5190	Agnieszka Radwanska	Sloane Stephens	You started well and then she kind of got back into it. Can you talk about the match?	5190_0.q	16.0	0	4th Round	SONY OPEN TENNIS	Premier
5190_1	Yeah, definitely. You can always take something from it and get better. That's always a good thing.	5190_1.a	2013-03-25	F	5190	Agnieszka Radwanska	Sloane Stephens	Are you able to take a positive from a match like this where you really were hanging tough against her and then maybe the match slipped away from you a little bit? Are you able to take the positives from that?	5190_1.q	16.0	0	4th Round	SONY OPEN TENNIS	Premier
5190_2	Yeah. I mean, I definitely felt I should have held serve at 32. It didn't happen, and it is what it is.	5190_2.a	2013-03-25	F	5190	Agnieszka Radwanska	Sloane Stephens	You had the ace to go up 4015 with a chance to even that second set at 3All. Did you feel that was a big momentum shifter when she was able to come back and break you?	5190_2.q	16.0	0	4th Round	SONY OPEN TENNIS	Premier
5190_3	No. I mean...	5190_3.a	2013-03-25	F	5190	Agnieszka Radwanska	Sloane Stephens	Has it been harder for you in professional tennis since beating Serena at the Australian Open? You're 19. You have just done the greatest thing you can possibly do. Has the next step been harder than you thought it was going to be?	5190_3.q	16.0	0	4th Round	SONY OPEN TENNIS	Premier
5190_4	I mean, just a rough time. I don't know. There's not there's no specific thing that I'd say has happened or is not happening, but I don't think it really matters. I'm 16 in the world. I can lose in the first round the next two months and I probably would still be top 30. I'm not really too concerned about winning or losing or any of that, I don't think. My life has changed, yeah, but I wouldn't say I'm in a panic or anything.	5190_4.a	2013-03-25	F	5190	Agnieszka Radwanska	Sloane Stephens	What's happening differently since Australia in these matches? You've lost five of seven. What's going on differently than what was happening at the Australian that was working so well?	5190_4.q	16.0	0	4th Round	SONY OPEN TENNIS	Premier
5190_5	Obviously.	5190_5.a	2013-03-25	F	5190	Agnieszka Radwanska	Sloane Stephens	But you want to win, obviously.	5190_5.q	16.0	0	4th Round	SONY OPEN TENNIS	Premier
5756_0	The final? I have never been in a Davis Cup final.	5756_0.a	2014-10-28	M	5756	nan	Jeremy Chardy	What is your best memory of Davis Cup? Is it the atmosphere? Do you have any special memory of a final, I mean?	5756_0.q	30.0	1	1st Round	BNP PARIBAS MASTERS	Masters 1000
5756_1	Nothing for a final. Well, of course the atmosphere of a Davis Cup, yes, I know that, but I just watched on TV the last final from France, but it's so different watching TV than being just there, so I have no answer to your question.	5756_1.a	2014-10-28	M	5756	nan	Jeremy Chardy	But on television maybe? Anything that struck you?	5756_1.q	30.0	1	1st Round	BNP PARIBAS MASTERS	Masters 1000
5756_2	Yes, after the match I was quite annoyed, because I had played well for the whole week. And against Robredo I played a good match. I went a lot up to the net. I was really trying to get those points. So I was annoyed, but I was also happy with the week I had. And it was also the best game I played indoors, so that was the good part of it.	5756_2.a	2014-10-28	M	5756	nan	Jeremy Chardy	Back to your match in Valencia, you were playing well except maybe at some moments. Were you annoyed because you were playing well?	5756_2.q	30.0	1	1st Round	BNP PARIBAS MASTERS	Masters 1000
5756_3	Well, I was a bit tense in the beginning of the match. Later on, Kenny played a very good match. He served well. He mixed it up all along. And as I said before, I didn't expect him to play so well from the baseline. He was moving well, and he didn't miss much. So we had good rallies. It was a good fight for the whole match, because neither of us wanted to give up, and the two sets were in a tiebreaker, and I'm happy I won them.	5756_3.a	2014-10-28	M	5756	nan	Jeremy Chardy	In the beginning today, it was tough for you to get into that match. What bothered you? The surface? Your opponent?	5756_3.q	30.0	1	1st Round	BNP PARIBAS MASTERS	Masters 1000
5756_4	Well, we are used to it. On the court we are opponents, but as soon as the match is over, it's finished unless something very bad happens on the court. But otherwise, we forget about it, and we had decided before this tournament to play together, anyway. We decided to focus on the doubles match, although it was not very easy because we didn't have much time between the singles and the doubles match. It was a pity.	5756_4.a	2014-10-28	M	5756	nan	Jeremy Chardy	What did you do between the singles and the doubles? Is it easy to become friends again after a match like this?	5756_4.q	30.0	1	1st Round	BNP PARIBAS MASTERS	Masters 1000
5756_5	Well, I'm happy with this year. As far as I'm concerned, this is my best season. I think I was consistent during the whole year. I played good matches. I'm very happy with this season. Now I would like to improve my game further. I want to play like I did in Valencia, go up to the net more often and be more aggressive so I can finish off the points at the net. I need to improve my returns, also, because if I return well, I can put pressure on my opponent. This is important. I have been working on this all year round, and I do that better now. What I need to do now is win more matches in the tournaments and be top seeded, and during the off period I'll keep working on these things and I hope I'll play better next year.	5756_5.a	2014-10-28	M	5756	nan	Jeremy Chardy	So now what do you have to do to go just one step further? A bit of luck, too?	5756_5.q	30.0	1	1st Round	BNP PARIBAS MASTERS	Masters 1000
5756_6	I'm not thinking about that. I'm just thinking about how I'm going to play tomorrow. I'm very focused. I'll take my chances. I don't believe this match will change anything. I'll just do my little thing, and we'll see what happens.	5756_6.a	2014-10-28	M	5756	nan	Jeremy Chardy	If you win that match against Federer, do you feel you might be selected for the Davis Cup team?	5756_6.q	30.0	1	1st Round	BNP PARIBAS MASTERS	Masters 1000
5756_7	It is always an important moment in your career when you're able to play and win against a player like him. I enjoyed that moment. He beat me in the beginning of the year, and I beat him the second time, so tomorrow I'm just going to play my match. But we all say it's always difficult to play against him, and I'll stay focused on my own game.	5756_7.a	2014-10-28	M	5756	nan	Jeremy Chardy	You played Federer twice this year, in the beginning and the middle of the season. The second match was just when he became a father and you won him. But was this victory very significant for you? It was not just because he had just become a father.	5756_7.q	30.0	1	1st Round	BNP PARIBAS MASTERS	Masters 1000
5143_0	Um, well, I didn't play a lot of matches on the hard court right now, so I can say that, yeah, one of the best matches right now. Yeah, I was expecting tough match what was for sure. I mean, the score looks quite easily but it wasn't. It was very close games and important points. Yeah, I'm glad that I'm through.	5143_0.a	2013-08-08	F	5143	Eugenie Bouchard	Petra Kvitova	Maybe the best you played on hard court since you came back? Pretty impressive overall?	5143_0.q	7.0	1	2nd Round	ROGERS CUP WOMEN	Premier
5143_1	Yeah, I believe that she's quite tired after the round what she has, and it was important to stay in the rallies and not to have a lot of mistakes, and that was the key I think for today.	5143_1.a	2013-08-08	F	5143	Eugenie Bouchard	Petra Kvitova	I guess against her the key is to make sure she doesn't control the points, no?	5143_1.q	7.0	1	2nd Round	ROGERS CUP WOMEN	Premier
5143_2	Yeah, I faced her. I mean, she's playing very aggressively too. She had great matches. She played very well, and it will be important to stay focused for every point. She's playing very aggressively and going for the winners, same game as me. We will see tomorrow, but I'm looking forward.	5143_2.a	2013-08-08	F	5143	Eugenie Bouchard	Petra Kvitova	You're facing Sorana Cirstea tomorrow. Have you faced her before, and are you thinking how to go about the match?	5143_2.q	7.0	1	2nd Round	ROGERS CUP WOMEN	Premier
5143_3	No, it will be quite shaky, because if I will play only the rallies, then I will be the second player on the court and that's not my game. So I have to be really focused and play my game but not with the mistakes. Maybe to stay like more in the rally, but it's quite shaky, and I will see during the match, for sure.	5143_3.a	2013-08-08	F	5143	Eugenie Bouchard	Petra Kvitova	You were saying it's important to stay in the rallies because you knew that Sam was probably a little tired after Carlsbad last week, but against Cirstea, is that sort of the same thing where you want to make sure to extend her a little bit?	5143_3.q	7.0	1	2nd Round	ROGERS CUP WOMEN	Premier
5143_4	Um, not really. I mean, I know that she has a good game to beat Caroline, what she showed. And against Jelena, I didn't expect anything. I mean, it was quite open matches with Caroline, but I think if Cirstea is playing very well and she has a lot of winners, then she can beat anyone, for sure.	5143_4.a	2013-08-08	F	5143	Eugenie Bouchard	Petra Kvitova	Were you surprised that she was able to beat Wozniacki and Jankovic back to back in a short period of time?	5143_4.q	7.0	1	2nd Round	ROGERS CUP WOMEN	Premier
2685_0	Goals are just to keep coming back. Pretty boring. It's the answer I give every time, but I just feel like I get better. It's a matter of staying healthy. I had a few close matches that obviously could have gone either way in Australia, could have gone either way in Memphis. Roddick, two top-10 guys, definitely had chances to win those matches and lost to Karlovic, which is a large part not even tennis. So those are matches that are tough to gauge how well you're playing. Otherwise, I feel like I've been playing pretty well. I felt comfortable out there today. I felt pretty comfortable against a guy that definitely prefers clay, I think. So for me to take time away from him like I do when I'm playing well, it was a good sign. But those are always -- you keep getting better. I know my ranking's dropped, but I'm not that worried about it. I know on any given day and in any tournament if I'm not seeded and if I'm ranked real low, I'm assuming a lot of the higher seeds aren't really thrilled to be playing me early on in a tournament because I feel like I do still have the ability to compete with the top guys.	2685_0.a	2010-03-12	M	2685	nan	James Blake	Good way to start? Where are you sort of, James, just in terms of what your goals are and what you want to get out of the season at this point?	2685_0.q	52.0	1	1st Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
2685_1	Definitely leaves a little more up to chance, but I've been there before. When I was young and coming up I had to go through it. You have to beat some of the top guys to start gaining that respect when you're young. Now I've got to do it again to show that I hopefully still belong up there. To prove I belong in the talks for winning titles and for being seeded and all that kind of stuff, I have to improve myself because there's no one else to blame. I can't complain about bad draws all year. Eventually I have to beat some of those guys. It's still up to me to do that.	2685_1.a	2010-03-12	M	2685	nan	James Blake	Does that make you edgier when you see the draw?	2685_1.q	52.0	1	1st Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
2685_2	Yeah, I watched. You know, I'm happy for those guys to go over there and feel the camaraderie, to have the team spirit. Sam and John are best buddies. They're so enthusiastic, and really two of the nicest guys you could imagine. I wish the team was larger and we could all go and travel and hang out together, but they deserve it. You know, they're going to bring home a title I think one of these years. Obviously not this year, but that's a tough draw, tough debut for John, and he competed as hard as anyone could, you know, all three days. He played great, I thought, against Novak, and Novak just showed why he's one of the best players in the world. And playing at home, that's about as tough a matchup as they go, in Serbia, slow clay, for a guy like Isner. But he competed real hard. I'm proud of those guys, and I think that experience will help them and take them far in the future. It's tough watching because you want to be there, but it's fun because you really like the guys. It would be a lot different if I felt like there were some guys that I really wanted to beat every day and I was going out there and competing with them. But those guys are such good guys. I want the best for them. I want the best for the team. I want the States to have another title. Without me, with me, whatever, I want them to win.	2685_2.a	2010-03-12	M	2685	nan	James Blake	How did you feel watching Davis Cup, or did you?	2685_2.q	52.0	1	1st Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
2685_3	Oh, man. I don't know. I don't even -- it would be too long of a story to get into. My racquets feel great right now. I don't have that many of them left, so I'm hoping that I can find a way to get more of them and find someone that can make a racquet exactly the way I like it. It seems like -- I think it's just the modernization of the game that the racquets that are being made now don't feel the same as the ones when I started on tour. When I started, I think it was different materials. Using different materials, to me, feels a little more hollow, tinny. I guess the materials that are used are lighter and more powerful. For me it just doesn't -- it doesn't have the same feel. I never thought I was picky about racquets until I went through this situation where I'm trying to find one that's just like mine, and no one has been able to do it. I'm really looking forward to putting this behind me and hopefully someone being able to make a racquet that I can use. We'll see if that happens soon.	2685_3.a	2010-03-12	M	2685	nan	James Blake	Kind of a tough situation if I have it right with your racquets. What's up? What's happening?	2685_3.q	52.0	1	1st Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
2685_4	Yes, I do. They get treated very well nowadays. I don't want any of them breaking. You won't see me throwing racquets. I might hit a ball, I might yell and scream, but I'm not going to be throwing racquets. It will be a weird feeling, because I haven't done that for a long time, to be able to have a bad practice and actually smash a racquet, because I haven't done that in years.	2685_4.a	2010-03-12	M	2685	nan	James Blake	Do you treat your racquets sort of like a Stradivarius?	2685_4.q	52.0	1	1st Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
2685_5	Um, yeah, I think that's what it is. You know, I'm -- I just go by what it feels like, and, you know, all the racquet technicians and the people at Dunlop and any other companies, they tell me what their opinions are and everything. They've got this material in it and this stiffness and this swing weight and this and that, and, you know, all I go by is what it feels like. I put in it in my hand, and if it doesn't feel good and I don't feel like I can compete with it, then that's all I go by. In my gut it feels like it's the material. They can make it the same weight, same balance, the same mold, the same everything. But if it doesn't feel the same, I only -- my only possibility in my head is that it's the material.	2685_5.a	2010-03-12	M	2685	nan	James Blake	They just can't find the right materials?	2685_5.q	52.0	1	1st Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
2685_6	Not enough. I got three.	2685_6.a	2010-03-12	M	2685	nan	James Blake	How many do you have? How many racquets do you have left?	2685_6.q	52.0	1	1st Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
2685_7	Yep.	2685_7.a	2010-03-12	M	2685	nan	James Blake	Really?	2685_7.q	52.0	1	1st Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
2685_8	I'd feel a little silly to do that. I'll leave that to the juniors. I used to do that when I was about 14, 15 years old.	2685_8.a	2010-03-12	M	2685	nan	James Blake	You need to take a different racquet on the side, so if you want to smash it you can walk over...	2685_8.q	52.0	1	1st Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
2685_9	I think the new material feels hollow, like tinny, and so it doesn't -- it's hard to describe. That's another problem is because I have a tough time articulating exactly what it is. But the ball, it feels like it jumps off, and then it still -- it still doesn't fly out. Like some of the ones that have a lot of power, when I hit it solid, with my racquet I feel like I hit it solid and it's going to drop down in the court, with the new material I feel like it goes a little further out and goes flying out. It's a material that to me it feels like it still jumps off. I don't have to create all my own pace, but it still dips down and has that spin that adds to it. I'm sure it's a tough combination for a company to make, and I'm finding that it's really, really tough for them to make.	2685_9.a	2010-03-12	M	2685	nan	James Blake	When you say it doesn't feel right, what is it that doesn't feel right?	2685_9.q	52.0	1	1st Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
2685_10	The string, I've been using Luxilon since 2002 probably, and that's -- to me, it doesn't get any better than that. Until someone puts a string in my hand that convinces me hands down it's better... Because I still remember the first day I used Luxilon. I put it on my racquet and I said, I'm switching. There was no doubt about it. It's so much better, and it feels -- it just feels so good. Because you can swing hard and it -- and the ball, just it grabs. The string grabs it. And I've said it before. I think that's been the biggest change in the game in the last 15, 20 years. The reason for sort of the death of the serve and volleyers is you're absolutely able to rip those returns with this string and you're able to put it down at people's feet so much easier. You're able to control the ball with power better than you can with, in my opinion, any other string. So until someone can show me something that feels better than that, I don't see myself changing string.	2685_10.a	2010-03-12	M	2685	nan	James Blake	Where does the string fit into this?	2685_10.q	52.0	1	1st Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
2685_11	Yeah, I think he's in a tough situation. I feel like he gets criticized no matter what he does, but I think you know that going in when you sign up for that job. It's about as tough as it gets. I think the healthcare bill is what he's really trying to push, and without me speaking ignorantly about a bill that's 2700 pages long that I have never read all of and never claimed to know a lot of the details, I feel like the intelligent people he surrounds himself with and with his intelligence and his goals, I think I'm willing to throw my support behind that. But, you know, like I've heard so many athletes and entertainers make statements that I'm sure are very uneducated, and I wouldn't want to do that. I wouldn't want to go out there and start spouting my opinions and expect people to listen to me over someone that's in the know, someone that's on Capitol Hill, someone making real decisions. So I wouldn't want to influence anyone based on my opinions. You know, my opinion is to support the president. I voted for him. I'm happy he's our leader. You know, I trust what he's going to do.	2685_11.a	2010-03-12	M	2685	nan	James Blake	So obviously this is a tennis tournament, but a little more than a year ago you came out more articulate earlier than just about anyone in support of the president. Now it kind of feels like it's the middle of the fourth set at Roland Garros or something. Could you give us a little thought about your thoughts about his situation?	2685_11.q	52.0	1	1st Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
2685_12	Yeah, well, they do start deadening, which is another issue, because I've been playing with these for so long that they've changed from when I first used them. So that's another issue where they have to try to make them as if they've been broken in, and so that's tough. But they eventually -- their life span probably isn't that much longer, because more than just deadening, they actually break without me doing anything outside of normal play.	2685_12.a	2010-03-12	M	2685	nan	James Blake	Back to the racquet for one second. Barring a fit of destructive anger, do they have a life? I mean, do you find after a certain period of time they get a little dead or...	2685_12.q	52.0	1	1st Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
2685_13	The last one that I had that broke was last year in Paris, and that was a bad day. I was just warming up and hitting returns, and I took a swing at a forehand and it hit the top of the frame and the throat just cracked. I wasn't too happy about that. It was a bad day.	2685_13.a	2010-03-12	M	2685	nan	James Blake	They crack?	2685_13.q	52.0	1	1st Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
2685_14	Yep.	2685_14.a	2010-03-12	M	2685	nan	James Blake	You travel around the circuit with three racquets?	2685_14.q	52.0	1	1st Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
2685_15	I played Memphis. That was the first tournament this year I played with them.	2685_15.a	2010-03-12	M	2685	nan	James Blake	Did you play Memphis with them or a different frame?	2685_15.q	52.0	1	1st Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
2685_16	Yeah.	2685_16.a	2010-03-12	M	2685	nan	James Blake	You played Australia with a different frame?	2685_16.q	52.0	1	1st Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
2685_17	Ah, it was a different racquet.	2685_17.a	2010-03-12	M	2685	nan	James Blake	Was the brand W?	2685_17.q	52.0	1	1st Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
2685_18	Yeah, I'm carrying some backups just in case. But, you know, I plan on using those three.	2685_18.a	2010-03-12	M	2685	nan	James Blake	You're carrying more racquets than the three, right? You're carrying something you don't care for?	2685_18.q	52.0	1	1st Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
2685_19	You know, he's one of the greats of all time, so, you know, he's gotta feel on that side of the court that he's going to win, and that's -- I think that's every great champion's take on a match, is they can find something in the other person that they feel like they can win, that they think they can prey on. Whether it's something as simple as preying on a weak backhand, a weak forehand, a weak serve or preying on them mentally because they feel like they're stronger mentally. He felt like that that day, and he took advantage. But, I mean, at 6-All in the breaker, I'll still remember that point forever. He had a dropshot and I had my chance and I picked the wrong side. I guessed wrong. I went to his backhand and he was sitting on it. If I go across there to the forehand, I'm up 7-6 serving in the tiebreaker and I have a better chance to win that at that point. So I mean, I did my best. There's no doubt about that. I did everything I could the right way. I was up two sets to love, but he played unbelievable tennis to get back into it. I was serving for the match, and I've gone over that game before in my head, and outside of missing a couple of first serves. But, you know, my first serve percentage isn't always the highest. I missed a couple there. He took advantage and did everything he could to break, and he got back into the match like a champion does. If he wants to put that on my mental state or me not going for it, I'll also still remember the first match point he had when I took a forehand from just about the alley inside in for a winner, and some of my friends still joke that that's their favorite shot I've ever hit in their lives and in my life. Because, you know, down, with your back to the wall to go for maybe a slightly lower percentage shot and go for it and make it, that was something I was happy to do. That's the way my game is set up. I'm going to take some chances and I'm going to use my forehand, and when I get it I'm going to go after it. I did that; didn't work out. He played too good. But, you know, his assessment is -- you know, if you look at a match through my eyes and through his eyes or any two players' eyes, they're going to see different things. If he saw me not going for it, he might be the first person in the world to say I don't go for my shots. But, you know, he's a tremendous source of information and a tremendous student of the game, so if he felt like I did let my foot off the accelerator, maybe I did. I haven't watched that whole match, you know. When I retire I'm sure I will. I'll look back on it, and maybe I'll say I let off a little bit. But I remember that match in my head and I feel like I was going for it. I wanted to win that so badly. I wanted to be in the semis, I wanted to be playing Robby out there, and I was looking forward to it. I still went for my shots. I just didn't connect it at the right times.	2685_19.a	2010-03-12	M	2685	nan	James Blake	Let me ask a different question. You mentioned books and so forth, and Andre's book, he does talk about the match at the US Open. He praises you and says it's great to be a part of one of the greatest night matches in tennis history. But he said at one point he did look in your eyes and he sensed that you weren't going for it. What were your thoughts about his passage? His take on that?	2685_19.q	52.0	1	1st Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
2685_20	A really good feeling. Andy, we practiced a little in LA last week. One of the first things he said to me was, Can we just talk about that forehand you hit at break point in Memphis? I just kind of laugh. You know, we've played each other so many times. I knew I had to guess. Breakpoint he's going to go for a big first serve. We've joked a couple times. He's like, Well, I was thinking that you know I want to go backhand but you're going to go back to the forehand. But, you've seen me do this before so you're thinking this and I'm going to get you. Honestly, that was what was going through my head. Like, all right, I know he wants to go backhand, but then he went forehand earlier and he thinks I'm going to be looking backhand so I'm going to guess forehand. I mean it's still just 50/50. But we were just guessing. We were thinking about everything we've gone through and all the matches we've played and what we're going to be thinking, and I just happened to guess right. You know, when I guess right, if it's right there and I happen to guess right it's just so exciting to me. I see it right where I want it to be and expected it to be, and I don't have a whole lot of time. So I just take my cut, and it felt that good that time. Again, I wish I could have come through in that match. Maybe that's one, if Andre saw, he would have thought I went for too much, because in the breaker I made a couple mistakes. I went for some shots that I like to think I'm going to make and I missed, and Andy took advantage and capitalized and served well enough to get him over the finish line there. But that's the way I play, and those forehands are a lot of fun. I hope I got plenty more left in me.	2685_20.a	2010-03-12	M	2685	nan	James Blake	Sometimes your forehand just, like you hit one in Memphis that was just out of this world. What is that feeling when you just crunch that forehand for an outright winner a billion miles an hour?	2685_20.q	52.0	1	1st Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
2685_21	Well, I think the schedule, when I left the council, one of the biggest things on the table was the schedule, finding a way to make it better for players in terms of their health, keeping guys healthy, keeping their careers going longer. Then the other big one is finances, which it's great we've got a new title sponsor with Corona. So I think they did their job with the board, with the executives in finding a sponsor. So hopefully our pension can be funded, we can get the bonus pool back maybe. So some things like that that are going to help the game. And also in terms of publicity, maybe that's going to add to our advertising budget, get it more popular around the world. I think it's pretty darn popular in Europe and Australia, and maybe just needs to be increased the profile here in the States. Of course, if myself or Andy or the Isners or the Querreys start winning Grand Slams, that's going to help as well.	2685_21.a	2010-03-12	M	2685	nan	James Blake	You've had the top few players on the council for the first time ever and coming up in a couple years now. Do you have any sense of like what their agenda is or, you know, what their top priorities are and also if they've had any effect on where the tour is headed?	2685_21.q	52.0	1	1st Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
2685_22	There probably hasn't been a ton of progress, but they're doing what they can. I mean, I think you're dealing with a situation. If we're going to talk about politics, there's plenty of politics involved in the tennis. It's tough sometimes to get things done. There are people who are stopping it. If you want to cut the schedule down, those people that are gonna get cut are gonna fight it pretty hard. You can't just take tournaments away from a city or a tournament that has every right to that that week. They've paid their dues, they've maybe waited and then they paid, and they're making a financial commitment. You can't just say, Well, the players want to take some time off so we're cutting you. So that's tough. It makes it -- it makes it so their hands are kind of tied. We want certain things, but then the tournaments want other things. We have to find a balance and a compromise. That was a bit of a frustration when I was on the council. You are a player, you want what's best for the players, but the tournaments are also trying to make a profit. They're trying to find a way to be -- to do what's best for the tournaments. In their opinion, what's best for the tournaments is best for the tour. In the players' opinion, what's best for the players is best for the tour. Makes it tough. You have to find those compromises. We'll see if they get more accomplished in terms of schedule. But like I said, it's really tough, and it's something that hopefully one day we'll get solved. But for right now, we have to do the best with what we've got. They've cut down. They've made a few changes in the rules, and the mandatory tournaments which is good, because I get an exception because I've played so many matches. Next year just for being old I'll get another exception. (laughter.) You know, there's a few of those built in there, so you don't -- you don't have to play eight out of eight plus the four Grand Slams and plus the 500s. It makes it so it's a pretty full schedule.	2685_22.a	2010-03-12	M	2685	nan	James Blake	Do you have a clear sense of what it is they wanted to accomplish? You mentioned schedule. Based on what the players have been saying the last few months doesn't sound like much progress.	2685_22.q	52.0	1	1st Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
2685_23	At a certain.	2685_23.a	2010-03-12	M	2685	nan	James Blake	At a certain age?	2685_23.q	52.0	1	1st Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
2685_24	Yeah, I think if you start the year at 31. Do you know if that's right? I think if you start the year -- once the year starts and you're 31 years old, you get to take one of the Masters Series off.	2685_24.a	2010-03-12	M	2685	nan	James Blake	That's come in since they've been on the council?	2685_24.q	52.0	1	1st Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
2685_25	I did.	2685_25.a	2010-03-12	M	2685	nan	James Blake	You spoke about forehands. I want to segue to foursomes. I think you played some golf maybe over the weekend.	2685_25.q	52.0	1	1st Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
2685_26	No, no. You got scouts everywhere? I was on the golf course with Mardy, Pete, and one of Pete's friends.	2685_26.a	2010-03-12	M	2685	nan	James Blake	Was it Pete, you, Andy, and Mardy?	2685_26.q	52.0	1	1st Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
2685_27	Well, I'm the worst out of those three by far. But Mardy, Mardy's the best; Pete's couple strokes behind him. Pete had a little bit of an off day that day, though. So it was me and Mardy against Pete and his buddy. Me and his buddy were about pretty even. Mardy's probably a couple strokes better than Pete. But it's Pete's home course. Me and Mardy got 'em. I'm sure the next question is who won.	2685_27.a	2010-03-12	M	2685	nan	James Blake	So of the three tennis players, how did we do? What's the leaderboard?	2685_27.q	52.0	1	1st Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
2685_28	It translates on his drive. He can bomb that thing. I think he got the loose, you know, loose upper body and flexibility. It's a big drive. And then the athleticism, yeah, he's pretty talented with his hands around the green. It's definitely -- he's got a lot of talent. I mean, it's not a shocker. Mardy the same. Mardy has tons of talent. Hits the ball long, good hands, good feel, and then I just hack it around and have some fun. So it's a good time. We had a great time, and I appreciate it for Pete taking us out there when we were out in LA.	2685_28.a	2010-03-12	M	2685	nan	James Blake	No. The next question is: Pete's style is a big serve, big forehand, athleticism, comes to the net. Does that translate to golf at all?	2685_28.q	52.0	1	1st Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
4501_0	I mean, like you say, today is another story. Yeah, I mean, I was feeling like first set was okay, like normal. But after first set, I was follow the rhythm of her. I was follow her, what she does on the court. Suddenly 4Love down, I was feeling, What happened? One second, 4Love down already. (Snapping fingers.) I was like, Okay, don't think about how is score. Just try to keep going. If I lose second set, it's still like one set all. I still have chance.	4501_0.a	2012-08-29	F	4501	Casey Dellacqua	Na Li	You were saying the other day you're feeling more comfortable this year than you have in the past on American hard courts. Is that feeling continuing?	4501_0.q	8.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4501_1	I mean, I sure happy I still in the tournament. I didn't play best tennis today. At least I can stay in New York. I don't need fly back to China, yeah.	4501_1.a	2012-08-29	F	4501	Casey Dellacqua	Na Li	You're happy with the way you were able to get out of trouble?	4501_1.q	8.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4501_2	Last year in the French Open. (Smiling.)	4501_2.a	2012-08-29	F	4501	Casey Dellacqua	Na Li	When is the last time you felt this good about your tennis?	4501_2.q	8.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4501_3	Because after I win a Grand Slam, you know, I was feeling actually the same. But I think I am totally wrong because I couldn't concentration on the court anymore. I don't have experience anymore. I have to do so many things on the court, off the court. I was thinking, I'm still athlete or not? Last year after French Open I didn't do well on the tennis court. So, yeah, I was happy I can have very good winter training and start beginning of this year.	4501_3.a	2012-08-29	F	4501	Casey Dellacqua	Na Li	That's a long time.	4501_3.q	8.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4501_4	I'm not movie star. I'm athlete. I have to do good job on the tennis court. So I was feeling if I can't doing well, why the sponsor should come for me? They can come for another athlete. I really wanted to do well, but sometimes didn't work. I think I was make a lot  how you say  pressure for myself. I was feeling after I win a Grand Slam, against some player, face to face, they are feeling they nothing to lose. They come to court, boom, boom. Suddenly I'm losing match so easily. It's not still strong in mind.	4501_4.a	2012-08-29	F	4501	Casey Dellacqua	Na Li	After you were on the court after you won the French Open not playing well, were you actually thinking about things off the court, getting your picture taken, or I have to go do a commercial? Why did it distract you so much?	4501_4.q	8.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4501_5	It's totally different story because I was used to one year to learn what I should do. Time can change everything, yeah. So right now I was think, Okay, I need take all pressure out. I win French is last year, so nothing worry about what I should do. So right now just continue. I was feeling I still love my tennis life, so I really want to challenge one more time to see how far I can get.	4501_5.a	2012-08-29	F	4501	Casey Dellacqua	Na Li	In some ways you had to improve your game this summer so the players don't come to the court and, boom, boom, win?	4501_5.q	8.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4501_6	It was really tough. I was play Kim this year in Australia, so I think both of us play very good in the match. But for me is the worst because next day is Chinese New Year. After I lose the match, I was like, What was going on? Everyone was so happy without me, so I was like, Okay, just take the beer and totally drunk. Next day I wake up, I was like, Okay, forget what I do yesterday. (Laughter.) You know, in China, how you say, if you lose the day, they are feeling a whole year is not so lucky. So I said, Okay, c'mon. I have four match points. Suddenly I was lost. I was like, Okay, totally lost. I just drink all the time, yeah. (Smiling.)	4501_6.a	2012-08-29	F	4501	Casey Dellacqua	Na Li	If Kim advances, you would play her in the next round. Talk about what you would anticipate from that matchup. You could be her last professional match.	4501_6.q	8.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4501_7	Fortunately I not do the same. Maybe a couple of the beer, but not all the time. But for me I was feeling it was very tough match. I think it's tough ever. If Kim's win today, I mean, she's very like good player, a tough player, a very good athlete. It's really tough to play her. I know, because this is her last professional tournament. I mean, I really want to beat her. But if I beat her she has to left, so, you know, is really tough to find balance.	4501_7.a	2012-08-29	F	4501	Casey Dellacqua	Na Li	Will you drink if you win the next round?	4501_7.q	8.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4501_8	Yeah. Why should she retire this one?	4501_8.a	2012-08-29	F	4501	Casey Dellacqua	Na Li	Feels a little strange?	4501_8.q	8.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4501_9	I mean, if I can beat her, I would like to beat her. I mean, if I didn't beat her, I have to go home. So is very tough. But for sure it's good match.	4501_9.a	2012-08-29	F	4501	Casey Dellacqua	Na Li	You would feel bad if you beat her because you would be the bad girl who beat Kim Clijsters in her last professional tournament?	4501_9.q	8.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4501_10	Yes. So I didn't want to replay again from Australian Open. So I will try my best.	4501_10.a	2012-08-29	F	4501	Casey Dellacqua	Na Li	Plus two Australian Opens you were very close to beating her, no?	4501_10.q	8.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4501_11	Why Chinese still use chopsticks? Why Chinese have to put the family name first, right? I think lot American people couldn't understand, yeah. Two thing already. I couldn't find a third one.	4501_11.a	2012-08-29	F	4501	Casey Dellacqua	Na Li	We're playing here in New York. There's so much media. Could you step back and say the one or two things we Americans don't understand about your country, what would that be?	4501_11.q	8.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
468_0	I mean, I wasn't overly concerned. I had a lot of chances in the second set. He had one break point, which he obviously won. But, I mean, throughout the course of the match I was creating many more opportunities than him. I wasn't overly concerned. I just had to, you know, take my chances when they came. I did that in the third and fourth sets.	468_0.a	2015-06-01	M	468	Jeremy Chardy	Andy Murray	How concerned did you get in the course of that match, second set and early third?	468_0.q	3.0	1	4th Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
468_1	I mean, I'm sure both of us will have changed and, you know, probably improved since that time. I feel like I have a better understanding of how I need to play on this surface than I did back then, probably. But, you know, David is a fantastic player on all of the surfaces. But, you know, here he's had his best results, I think. Out of all of the majors, he obviously made the final here. You know, he's made some semis, as well. Obviously be a big test for me, that match.	468_1.a	2015-06-01	M	468	Jeremy Chardy	Andy Murray	The last time you played David on clay was three years ago here. How different of a player are you from that time on this surface?	468_1.q	3.0	1	4th Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
468_2	No, it wasn't that. It's just obviously that court is quite tight. Sometimes you get quite close to the linespeople. It's just one of those things that obviously from the player's point of view, you get a bit distracted when you know you're sliding close to someone. Like when you're about to take your racquet back, obviously you don't want it to hit the person. Also, you want to try to play a stroke, as well, if you can. It was more, just more that. It was nothing to do with the wetness of the court.	468_2.a	2015-06-01	M	468	Jeremy Chardy	Andy Murray	After all the rain and everything yesterday, was there a bit of an issue with the back of the court at the end in front of where your team was sitting?	468_2.q	3.0	1	4th Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
468_3	Less sick?	468_3.a	2015-06-01	M	468	Jeremy Chardy	Andy Murray	Gal sometime ago he lost against Roger and he said he wants to be more like the top players who seem never get ill, no sickness, no flu. Do you think it's a discipline question, the reason why maybe you'll get less sick than other players? Do you do something more careful?	468_3.q	3.0	1	4th Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
468_4	Yeah. I mean, I have obviously had my fair share of injuries throughout my career. In terms of illness, I mean, I don't go out late. You know, I know a lot of my friends that go out and party very late, you know, often wake up with sore throats the next day, you know, and can get sick. You know, you need to make sure you rest properly. Obviously with the amount of traveling and stuff we do throughout the year, you do pick up little bugs. But I never really say anything about that, you know, throughout the year when you do get sick. Because it's not all of the time you feel perfect with the lifestyles that we live. But I try to yeah, I try to sleep properly, try to rest properly, eat properly. And yeah, I have been quite lucky in that respect, I would say.	468_4.a	2015-06-01	M	468	Jeremy Chardy	Andy Murray	Less sick, like no flu or something? Because you get more careful on when you get out with more coats or anything?	468_4.q	3.0	1	4th Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
468_5	Well, I mean, it's going to be a tough match, because he's one of the best players in the world. On this surface he's, you know, for sure of one of the top sort of four or five players in the world. You know, obviously the higher ranked players you play, the less opportunities they give you, the less mistakes they give you, especially in important moments. Which maybe someone who is more inexperienced, you know, may rush at certain moments or make bad decisions. You know, that's not something that David does. So, yeah. I'm going to have to work extremely hard in that match and be very patient and try to dictate the play as much as I can.	468_5.a	2015-06-01	M	468	Jeremy Chardy	Andy Murray	You played two very aggressive players who hit a lot of winners, but also give you a few unforced errors. How difficult or how much of a challenge will it be now to play Ferrer, who is almost the opposite? He's more consistent, maybe slightly more resilient?	468_5.q	3.0	1	4th Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
468_6	Yeah. Well, I don't think there is loads of players that have done that. I mean, I have said a lot over the last five, six months that, you know, unfortunately, I'm playing against guys that make some of the things I have done look pretty average because of how good they have been. You know, Roger went through a period where he was making Grand Slam finals pretty much, you know, consistently and then he had the semifinal streak. I know it was ridiculous, as well. Then obviously his quarterfinal streak, I don't know how many it was, but it was something like 30odd	468_6.a	2015-06-01	M	468	Jeremy Chardy	Andy Murray	17 straight quarterfinals or better at the Grand Slams. I'm just wondering, that's obviously a terrific record. I'm just wondering how much sort of pleasure that gives you, that sort of unshowy consistency sort of compared to perhaps more the headlinegrabbing titles that you have won like Wimbledon, US Open?	468_6.q	3.0	1	4th Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
468_7	Yeah. So, yeah, in comparison to that, it's nothing. But, you know, in terms of the history of the game, there is not loads of players that have been that consistent at these events. So yeah, that's something that I look at, and I'm very, very proud of. Yeah, glad I have managed to maintain that consistency even when I've had, you know, obviously some tough periods over the last couple of years with the injuries and the back.	468_7.a	2015-06-01	M	468	Jeremy Chardy	Andy Murray	34?	468_7.q	3.0	1	4th Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
468_8	Yeah. I mean, it's very difficult to feel flat, really, when you play in an atmosphere like that. You know, the whole crowd's pretty pumped from the beginning of the match. You know, it felt, for me, anyway, like it was a highquality match, as well. I enjoy playing that way. It was for sure the best match I have played in this tournament so far, and, yeah, the crowd created a good atmosphere. I always enjoy that. You know, that's one of the challenges of being a professional sportsperson. You know, when you come up against sort of home favorites and the crowd aren't there for you, you need to, you know, find a way to use it to motivate you. I feel like I have done that well.	468_8.a	2015-06-01	M	468	Jeremy Chardy	Andy Murray	How much did you enjoy that with the crowd and everything? They were getting quite into it at some point.	468_8.q	3.0	1	4th Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
468_9	Well, yeah. I mean, it's something I have always tried to improve upon. I feel like I'm much better now than I was before. But, yeah. It's just an unfortunate thing now that's very  you know, I think with tennis it gets picked up on a lot. You know, often when we go for our towels, the microphone is right there and you forget where you are sometimes. Whereas in some of the other sports, you know, like football, for example, I don't think that the language they use is, you know, that pleasant all the time, but obviously the camera is not there on them all of the time, and the microphone, so you don't hear it as much. Yeah, it's just unfortunate. I would rather I didn't do it, but unfortunately, it's one of the mistakes I make as a human being, and I try to be better. And I feel like I have improved it but far from perfect.	468_9.a	2015-06-01	M	468	Jeremy Chardy	Andy Murray	Slightly off topic, you tweeted a tennis coach the other day an apology for your language after he criticized you, he was showing some young kids. You said that was your failings, trying to be a role model. Is that something you think about a lot? Is that something you really want to try and improve upon?	468_9.q	3.0	1	4th Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
468_10	Yeah. I mean, for sure. I think obviously, you know, if he can get past, if he can get past Stan, he's coming up against either Kei or Jo. Jo has played in a slam final and so has Kei. But the difference in experience at this stage of an event, you know, Roger trumps them, you know, comfortably in that respect. And, you know, he hasn't used up too much energy, I wouldn't have thought. Obviously playing the match against Gal over two days, maybe that helps. I don't know. You know, it was not two long sets yesterday or two long sets today. I'm sure he will go into the match with Stan fairly fresh. There is absolutely no reason why he couldn't win the event, but anyone that wants to win this event is going to have to play great tennis because of the level of the field that's still left in it.	468_10.a	2015-06-01	M	468	Jeremy Chardy	Andy Murray	Although Roger is ranked second, there hasn't been a lot of focus on him in this tournament, your streak and Novak and Nadal. Do you think at his age that he's legitimately someone that could make it to the final weekend here?	468_10.q	3.0	1	4th Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
3309_0	I don't know who have been there before me, so I can't really compare myself. You know, I don't think about these things. I am so happy that I won this tournament. It's a huge tournament, so I'm very pleased about the way I have been playing this week and my result today.	3309_0.a	2011-03-20	F	3309	Marion Bartoli	Caroline Wozniacki	You're one of the first players in a long time to crack 10,000 points in the WTA world rankings. How do you see yourself in comparison to some of the people that have been there before you?	3309_0.q	1.0	1	The Final	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
3309_1	Well, it means a lot. It's pretty much a two-week event, and you have days in between like in the Grand Slams. It's a big tournament, and I'm very, very happy. Once again, you know, I showed that I can play great tennis, and I've beaten some really good players this week.	3309_1.a	2011-03-20	F	3309	Marion Bartoli	Caroline Wozniacki	I'm sure you're very excited and happy, as you said, about this. What does a title like this mean to you?	3309_1.q	1.0	1	The Final	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
3309_2	It's so heavy. But, you know, it's beautiful. I think it's very beautiful. I just hope that they will ship it home to me, because to have it in my luggage will be just extra kilos and extra overweight. I already have too much.	3309_2.a	2011-03-20	F	3309	Marion Bartoli	Caroline Wozniacki	Any thoughts on this trophy?	3309_2.q	1.0	1	The Final	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
3309_3	I played very, very well, I thought, actually in the whole match, but first set I felt like I had the most control. I had her running; I had her moving. Second set, she just went for her shots. She started to hit even harder. I didn't feel I played badly. I thought actually I played pretty good, but she was very steady, keeping the pressure. In the third set, I just kept my head cool. We had a lot of long rallies, but I came up with the wins, so it was nice.	3309_3.a	2011-03-20	F	3309	Marion Bartoli	Caroline Wozniacki	Can you kind of describe the flow of the match? You seemed like you really had it there at the beginning. She fought back in that second set.	3309_3.q	1.0	1	The Final	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
3309_4	Well, actually, I wasn't thinking too much about that. I was thinking more about just me not being too hard on myself, just to keep staying positive, because I felt like I was playing good tennis. I was like, If she keeps playing like this, well then it's just too good. But I'm not going to give her anything.	3309_4.a	2011-03-20	F	3309	Marion Bartoli	Caroline Wozniacki	Did you expect her level to drop in the third set? Did you say, at the changeover, Okay, she played great in that second set, but she's not going to be able to keep that level up?	3309_4.q	1.0	1	The Final	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
3309_5	I wasn't actually too nervous, but, um, from one side it started to be very windy, and on the other side you had to really hit through the wind. It was very important for me to keep my legs moving, because I could feel that we have been out there for a long time. You know, if you stand too still you start making too many unforced errors, so it was important for me just to keep moving and give the signal to my brain that I actually still need to work my feet here.	3309_5.a	2011-03-20	F	3309	Marion Bartoli	Caroline Wozniacki	It seemed like maybe I'm wrong that you were actually a little nervous closing the match out, you were kind of moving your feet a lot. Is that true? Just talk about the feelings.	3309_5.q	1.0	1	The Final	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
3309_6	Well, he said, You're playing great. Just keep it up. It's just one break in the second set. Just hang in there. You're doing fine.	3309_6.a	2011-03-20	F	3309	Marion Bartoli	Caroline Wozniacki	What did your dad say to you when you were talking to him on court?	3309_6.q	1.0	1	The Final	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
3309_7	Yes. I mean, I am paying so much attention to my conditioning, and to be in great shape in my fitness is a very big part of my training. I think I've won a lot of matches that way. And also, I can keep going. I can keep playing out there for hours and hours. Yeah, I mean, it's definitely a good sign for me when I can see the opponent getting a little bit more tired. We had a lot of long rallies, but I felt like I recovered maybe a little bit faster than she did. That's like a good feeling to have on my side.	3309_7.a	2011-03-20	F	3309	Marion Bartoli	Caroline Wozniacki	She said at the end she got exhausted and tired. Once again, you did not. You know, it's pretty amazing week after week as much as you play you don't even get tired within matches. Can you just talk about your conditioning and how much that helps you.	3309_7.q	1.0	1	The Final	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
3309_8	Um, well, I don't think you can compare these two things, because -- of course Wimbledon juniors was a big thing for me at that time, and, you know, of course it's great and was a step for me to reach the senior high level. But now I'm playing on the women's tour, I'm playing the biggest tournaments, and I'm winning them, a lot of tournaments. I mean, this is my 14th title, so I'm very happy. You know, it's completely different. But again, I'm just enjoying myself out there, and I think that it shows in my game.	3309_8.a	2011-03-20	F	3309	Marion Bartoli	Caroline Wozniacki	How do you rank this victory? You won the Wimbledon juniors when you were 16. How does this feel to you?	3309_8.q	1.0	1	The Final	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
3309_9	Well, of course, it does a little bit, because I know that I still have more energy in myself. Yeah, I'm just thinking, Okay, keep the long rallies and keep definitely in the game.	3309_9.a	2011-03-20	F	3309	Marion Bartoli	Caroline Wozniacki	When you can see her visibly tired, leaning up against the wall, breathing heavy, does that give you a lift at all?	3309_9.q	1.0	1	The Final	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
3309_10	I just love playing matches. I like winning. I like holding the trophy in my hands. It gives me that energy. It's great. You know, I don't feel tired, to be honest. I feel great. I feel in good shape. I have my family and my friends around me. I think that helps me a lot, too, because I'm not thinking tennis all the time. Off the court I can relax. I can think about other things. I can do other things. That just keeps me fresh. I think actually when I have a longer training period, like in the offseason, I get more mentally tired because I know every morning I have to wake up and I have three or four hours of tennis in front of me and maybe three hours of fitness. So, you know, that first hour in that practice, I'm like, Okay, this is gonna be a long day. But when you have matches, you know, you go out there, you play for one-and-a-half, two hours, and then you're off, and hopefully with a win.	3309_10.a	2011-03-20	F	3309	Marion Bartoli	Caroline Wozniacki	Do you ever get mentally tired? The fact that you've played a lot of the last couple years, didn't have that much time coming into this year, and, again consistently deep in every single tournament, seems like you're fresh. How do you do that?	3309_10.q	1.0	1	The Final	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
3309_11	I can block that out. But especially in the back when they start moving and walking, because the ball is like right there, then, you know, it's just nice if they sit down. But the noise, I don't mind. I think it's actually great that you can hear an atmosphere and they are pumping us up. So it was great.	3309_11.a	2011-03-20	F	3309	Marion Bartoli	Caroline Wozniacki	Do you get easily distracted by the crowd, or can you just block that out?	3309_11.q	1.0	1	The Final	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
3309_12	I'm leaving tonight. (Smiling.)	3309_12.a	2011-03-20	F	3309	Marion Bartoli	Caroline Wozniacki	How are you going to celebrate?	3309_12.q	1.0	1	The Final	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
3309_13	I liked Hingis? Yes.	3309_13.a	2011-03-20	F	3309	Marion Bartoli	Caroline Wozniacki	Lots of fun. You liked Hingis growing up a bit, right?	3309_13.q	1.0	1	The Final	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
3309_14	Yes, I definitely remember watching her play. I mean, I watched so many of her matches, and, I mean, she was such a big role model for me. The things that I liked about her game was that she was thinking so well on the court. She could play aggressively, but she was not a power player in particular. She didn't have as much power as some of the other girls, but still she knew how to take advantage of the others' power. She knew how to do angle dropshots, she could play high if she needed to. She was a very intelligent player on the court. That's what I liked. I liked that she wasn't only relying on her, you know, power, like some other players, but that she could always find -- not always, but she found a way to win even though she was not maybe as strong.	3309_14.a	2011-03-20	F	3309	Marion Bartoli	Caroline Wozniacki	Do you remember watching her play when she was winning her slams and how she played? Because there are some similarities I think between your two games. Just talk about her a little bit.	3309_14.q	1.0	1	The Final	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
3309_15	Well, I'm going in there, and I'll do my best. We will have to see what my best is in Miami.	3309_15.a	2011-03-20	F	3309	Marion Bartoli	Caroline Wozniacki	So it's rare that players go back to back at Indian Wells and Miami, but since you're always fresh, I guess you're giving yourself a chance at that.	3309_15.q	1.0	1	The Final	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
3309_16	Well, I go back to Monaco for a week, and then I just go straight to Miami on the court. No, I'm kidding. I'm going to Miami, straight over. Doesn't make sense to leave back to Europe.	3309_16.a	2011-03-20	F	3309	Marion Bartoli	Caroline Wozniacki	Are you going straight to Miami or are you going to Monaco?	3309_16.q	1.0	1	The Final	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
785_0	Oh, yeah, no doubt.  Last year was a good match, too.  I think I remember serving for the match at 6-4, 5-4 maybe 6-4, 5-3.  Got broke and he came back and I almost ended up losing the match.  But I remember playing well against him, too. Of course, I wasn't too happy when I saw the draw coming out playing Almagro first up, because he's a great clay courter and a very dangerous player on any surface.  So to come through convincingly in two sets not being broken both time racing away with the lead with an early break, which was perfect.	785_0.a	2007-05-08	M	785	Nicolas Almagro	Roger Federer	Considering how tight the match was here last year, were you pleased with how it went today?	785_0.q	1.0	1	2nd Round	INTERNAZIONALI BNL D'ITALIA (MEN)	Masters
785_1	I mean, it's a pretty similar approach I have again this year after winning three majors in a row.  I'm coming into the French Open maybe being able to win four.  So the preparation has been there since the Australian Open, of course.  I've been trying to get into the best possible shape since then. Definitely, again, the plan is to try to play Hamburg which would give me more match play again.  I've been practicing I think a bit harder this year than last year in terms of not having played such a tough Monaco final.  I only took one day off and have been practicing every day accept in Majorca and one thing I needed to do here on Friday. I need a few days off, but I've been practicing really hard, like four or five hours a day, which was fantastic.  In Switzerland I had a hitting partner come along, French junior, No.1 in the world.  We had some good hitting there.	785_1.a	2007-05-08	M	785	Nicolas Almagro	Roger Federer	Have you changed anything in your clay court preparations from last year?	785_1.q	1.0	1	2nd Round	INTERNAZIONALI BNL D'ITALIA (MEN)	Masters
785_2	Well, everything's possible at home I feel.  But the thing is not to play great at home but to play away from home as well.  I guess that's the secret to get the ranking up.  Many nations have the same problem.  They're not happy they're not happy with the players they have because they've been too spoiled in the past.	785_2.a	2007-05-08	M	785	Nicolas Almagro	Roger Federer	I think that Italian tennis needs help.  Perhaps your help.  Which advice can you give to Bracciali to beat Nadal?	785_2.q	1.0	1	2nd Round	INTERNAZIONALI BNL D'ITALIA (MEN)	Masters
785_3	Well, I mean, I think over best of three, why not take a chance and play very aggressive.  Bracciali is a player that can do that.  I had a touch match with him in Dubai.  I think any surface he's a dangerous player.	785_3.a	2007-05-08	M	785	Nicolas Almagro	Roger Federer	Do you think it's better to give to him corner or perhaps it's better to send the ball to the volley?	785_3.q	1.0	1	2nd Round	INTERNAZIONALI BNL D'ITALIA (MEN)	Masters
785_4	I think in terms of the guys who played the finals of Monaco and then here this week, I feel that Hamburg is definitely going to get more players this year than last year just because not only is it the best-of-three finals, but also the top eight guys get byes. So that, again, gives you much more air to breathe.  And if you were in the finals in Rome you get two days off for that, so much needed important Wednesday start.  Which, for instance, me and Raf wouldn't have gotten last year.  I think if we had gotten that one we would have played. But of you had to win six matches in seven days or six matches in six days that was just too much to ask for.	785_4.a	2007-05-08	M	785	Nicolas Almagro	Roger Federer	You made reference here to the shorter Monte-Carlo final, and obviously shorter finals all around now.  Do you think in a way that could help in the sense that it gives you a better chance of playing Hamburg and getting more matches in?	785_4.q	1.0	1	2nd Round	INTERNAZIONALI BNL D'ITALIA (MEN)	Masters
785_5	Well, right now it is.  I mean, can you put it over Wimbledon?  I guess never.  But the French Open is before Wimbledon, thank God, so I can really focus on the French Open. Yeah.  I don't know if that answers your question because I don't know myself I guess.	785_5.a	2007-05-08	M	785	Nicolas Almagro	Roger Federer	I'm sorry if you already answered this.  Is the French Open your absolute No.1 priority this year?	785_5.q	1.0	1	2nd Round	INTERNAZIONALI BNL D'ITALIA (MEN)	Masters
785_6	I mean, it's been nice actually for the last month on clay.  We've had a bit tough few days just before Monaco.  I think it was quite windy and rainy and a bit. I remember I lost my rhythm a bit from the baseline there that's why I didn't play so well first up in Monaco.  I think it was well really quick conditions all of a sudden the first day. On the match days they always water the court much less than during the practice times because they had more time to water the court, and also it rained more.  But these conditions were very nice, you know. On court, I mean, Corretja asked me, too.  This was perfect conditions for you?  Honestly quick or slow I don't mind.  I've proved myself in Hamburg in the past.  Every time it's a bit slow I like it too because I get more grip and the ball stays a bit lower.  And if it's nicer it's a bit quicker for me which is obviously an advantage. I think you got to be able to play with all conditions on clay because they change sometimes throughout the match.  So you got to be able to adapt and, I think that's a big plus for me that I can do that.	785_6.a	2007-05-08	M	785	Nicolas Almagro	Roger Federer	Were these basically ideal conditions for you on clay today?	785_6.q	1.0	1	2nd Round	INTERNAZIONALI BNL D'ITALIA (MEN)	Masters
785_7	Yeah.  You could think it's a bit odd, but at the same time -- like I think I explained it the other day.  I said it's definitely not so cool for the live audience who's in the stadium and for the two players who are playing that day. I mean, we would love to battle it out for five sets and make a big spectacle for all of us.  Then at the same time we're happy to play best of three.  If you look at an entire season and an entire career you avoid injuries here and there. So what happens is maybe the live fan won't get the great match they were hoping for because it's over before it started, like in Monte-Carlo I felt.  But, you know, I think for the TVs it's just easier to set up.  You don't have.  To block a time for five hours and then tune out the last six minutes of last year's finals.  That would be tragic too. It's easier if it's this way, it seems.  It's a bit of a dilemma both ways.  I guess we're trying it this way and see how to goes.  But I think by having this system now more cities and countries will be able to see the top players instead of maybe like maybe Rome, maybe Monaco, and then Hamburg's going to miss out, or Paris, Bercy will miss out.  I think that will be cut down a little bit by adjusting this problem.	785_7.a	2007-05-08	M	785	Nicolas Almagro	Roger Federer	Do you think it's a bit odd now it's only the Grand Slams and Davis Cup where you got best-of-five-set matches, and virtually the rest of the year playing three sets?  Is that strange in the sport to be playing at a certain level and the rest of the year only three-set matches?	785_7.q	1.0	1	2nd Round	INTERNAZIONALI BNL D'ITALIA (MEN)	Masters
770_0	No, I'm still glad because I made an unbelievable week.  It was amazing week.  I can't forget all the matches that I won this week, so it's a great week for me. But I'm a little bit down because --  and sad -- because I couldn't play like I wanted because he made me crazy with his backhand and I couldn't make my play, my game. So I'm sad about this.  But still, it's a perfect week anyway.  I beat the No.1 in the world and I made semifinal, my first semifinal.  So I'm still so, so happy about it.	770_0.a	2007-05-12	M	770	Fernando Gonzalez	Filippo Volandri	Wonderful week.  You gave Italy a terrific week.  What does it feel like now?  Are you feeling that you've crashed?  Are you glad that you good did so well?	770_0.q	53.0	0	Semifinals	INTERNAZIONALI BNL D'ITALIA (MEN)	Masters
770_1	Yeah.  My serve was one of the bad point of the match today, because he made me a lot of -- he put me a lot of pressure, and when I saw this I start to serve even slower. So he could make his game, his job, and he made so well.  But still, anyway.	770_1.a	2007-05-12	M	770	Fernando Gonzalez	Filippo Volandri	Are you working on your serve?	770_1.q	53.0	0	Semifinals	INTERNAZIONALI BNL D'ITALIA (MEN)	Masters
621_0	Well, I would rate probably around 7 or 8. I think very solid performance. I've done just enough to win in straight sets. He started off very well, very aggressive, winners in the first couple games. Well, I managed to stay calm and, you know, believe I can come back. That's what I've done. I think the crucial turning point was the 10th game of the first set when I won the set and I started playing more freely. You know, I thought I had the match under control and everything was fine.	621_0.a	2015-07-01	M	621	Jarkko Nieminen	Novak Djokovic	How many marks would you give yourself out of 10 for your performance today?	621_0.q	1.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
621_1	Well, it's completely different surface than any other. Obviously each surface requires a certain adjustment, especially with the movement. I think that's one of the priorities that you're looking into when you're coming onto grass, to try to make this transition from clay, from sliding on the court, to grass, where you have to make more of a, say, sneaking or adjustment steps before the strokes, to make that transition as efficiently as possible and quick as possible. This year we have an extra week between Roland Garros and Wimbledon. Up to this year was only two weeks, and it was really very short time for a player to get in the shape for this tournament. But I feel like this surface is being the fastest on the tour, demands the player to be more aggressive, to use more slice, more variety in his game. You know, maybe block the returns, come to the net. I'm not a serveandvolley player. I don't come to the net very often, but on grass I try to use that variety and try to use the opportunities off the serve or off the good groundstrokes when I see the player on the stretch. These are particular things that I look forward to.	621_1.a	2015-07-01	M	621	Jarkko Nieminen	Novak Djokovic	Is there anything you do on grass that's better than on any other surface?	621_1.q	1.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
621_2	A little bit of everything.	621_2.a	2015-07-01	M	621	Jarkko Nieminen	Novak Djokovic	You play Bernard Tomic next. The Aussie Fanatics are out in full force. Have you ever found them distracting or funny?	621_2.q	1.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
621_3	I think it's nice to see in the tennis that there are a group of guys coming to support their player. I think tennis maybe misses that a little bit more, more of I'd say Davis Cup atmosphere. But you get used to it once you play in front of them, which I've done in Australia quite a few times with Lleyton, against Lleyton. So I know what's expecting me. Bernard and Kyrgios and Kokkinakis are three young players from Australia that are under the radar of the world of tennis, especially the world of Australia. Everybody's relying on them and cheering them on so they can be fighting for the biggest trophies. They definitely do have the quality. I'm going to play against one of them, so let's hope I can play well.	621_3.a	2015-07-01	M	621	Jarkko Nieminen	Novak Djokovic	What are your thoughts on it?	621_3.q	1.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
621_4	It wasn't as bad as I thought. People were talking about it and predicting really difficult conditions. But I didn't find it as difficult as I thought it might be.	621_4.a	2015-07-01	M	621	Jarkko Nieminen	Novak Djokovic	How did you find the effect of the heat today?	621_4.q	1.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
621_5	Well, I do expect him to serve well, and I do expect him, you know, to mix up the game, come up with a lot of variety. That's what he does. He's got a lot of talent in his hands. He can play flat shots. He can play short slice, come to the net. He has a very quick motion for the serve. It's very difficult to read it on grass. This is the surface that he loves playing the most on. So it's going to be a difficult match. I remember was it 2011, I think, quarterfinals, we played against each other. Four tough sets. So I'm not expecting anything easy there.	621_5.a	2015-07-01	M	621	Jarkko Nieminen	Novak Djokovic	What exactly are you expecting from Bernard when you play?	621_5.q	1.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
621_6	Well, it's his last Wimbledon. I have very nice relationship with Jarkko for many years. When I was coming into the professional tennis as an 18yearold, I was playing some challenger in Helsinki in Finland, that's where I met him the first time. Ever since then he's been very kind to me. He's one of the nicest guys on the tour that I know on the court and off the court. Just out of respect. There are these moments. In the present moment, maybe you are not aware how important it is, it's a milestone for him, it's his last match in Wimbledon. I'm sure he wanted to enjoy it a little bit. So he deserved the ovation.	621_6.a	2015-07-01	M	621	Jarkko Nieminen	Novak Djokovic	You didn't celebrate after match point. You went to hug Jarkko Nieminen, which is sporting. Why did you feel you wanted to do that?	621_6.q	1.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
621_7	What stats are you referring to? Post match?	621_7.a	2015-07-01	M	621	Jarkko Nieminen	Novak Djokovic	There are a huge number of stats available now. I'm wondering how much you look at those stats to help you prepare for your matches.	621_7.q	1.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
621_8	A little bit. Not too much. Once the match is behind me, I don't look at it too much. I look just forward to the next one, trying to get myself prepared, work on the things that my coach and my team thinks that I should work on. Just we analyze the next opponent and prepare ourselves. Of course, it is useful. I try not to pay too much attention to the numbers because then it can be a bit distracting.	621_8.a	2015-07-01	M	621	Jarkko Nieminen	Novak Djokovic	Match stats.	621_8.q	1.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
621_9	I thought it was one of the most beautiful moments that I experienced in my tennis career. One of the four biggest tournaments in the world. After losing a match, of course, in the ideal scenario it would be great that I would win that trophy. But it wasn't to be. I lost to a better player. I had to accept that and move on. But I thought that what I have experienced with Stan that day, the amount of respect we showed to each other, the way the postmatch ceremony has happened, and the way that both him and I received the ovation was very unique, very special. I'll remember it for a long time. You know, even though I had lost the match, that was a big win for me. It was something that is far more, you know, important than trophies. Winning or losing matches, it's the appreciation from the people. That is something that is really dear to my heart. It's a responsibility, as well, to keep on moving forward and keep on having the same kind of approach to the matches and to my colleagues.	621_9.a	2015-07-01	M	621	Jarkko Nieminen	Novak Djokovic	Going back to Navratilova, so many great champions have gotten warm, wonderful adulation in defeat. You had that incredible round of applause at Roland Garros. What were your thoughts at the moment, and now that you've had time to reflect on it, what are your thoughts on that match?	621_9.q	1.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
621_10	Well, I mean, you want to talk about the serve, then you would talk about probably Karlovic and Isner. Forehands, it would be probably Roger and Rafa. Backhands, Andy Murray and Davydenko had a great backhand. Berdych has a great forehand. I mean, then you have Ferrer that is a great competitor. He always gives you one ball back on the court. Now Nishikori has a fantastic backhand. Yeah, I mean, Stepanek had and has still very good volleys, a good feel. He's one of the few players that plays serve and volley. There are not many players who come into the net at the top of the men's game that often. So I hope I answered your question (smiling).	621_10.a	2015-07-01	M	621	Jarkko Nieminen	Novak Djokovic	You've been on the tour for more than 10 years now. Of all the opponents you've played, what is the best area of someone's game you played against, whether it be a forehand, backhand, and why?	621_10.q	1.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4865_0	The key was just to hang in there and stay with him. I knew that he's going to be very aggressive from the start coming to the net. He used his opportunities really well. He was very efficient at the net. Then, you know, I tried to decrease the number of unforced errors and step in when it's needed. I have done pretty well in the second and the third.	4865_0.a	2013-11-02	M	4865	Roger Federer	Novak Djokovic	It was a very tough first hour of the match, and then progressively you found a way to turn this around. What was the key for you?	4865_0.q	2.0	1	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS MASTERS	Masters 1000
4865_1	It's not the first time that I'm playing, you know, under these conditions. It's a big match, and Roger is somebody that has a lot of admirers around the world. He deserves a lot of respect for what he has achieved in his career. He's definitely a great player and personality on the court. For me, I was just trying to hang in there, as I said, you know, and, you know, wait for my opportunities. Because as the match progressed, I felt like I have more chances. My serve was better towards the end of the second set. And I got more free points, let's say, on my first serves, which was one of the keys today.	4865_1.a	2013-11-02	M	4865	Roger Federer	Novak Djokovic	Was there a bit of nerves maybe at the start with the crowd or anything? Because they were mostly for your opponent. Was it a factor?	4865_1.q	2.0	1	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS MASTERS	Masters 1000
4865_2	Well, it's a big match. Whenever I play Roger, it's obviously a big challenge for both of us. There is a lot of tension coming into the court, and, you know, I was just I just felt under pressure because he was returning well and he was playing well from the baseline. I didn't serve well and so obviously that's something that allowed him to win the first set and allowed him to be in the control of the match. So I needed to try to place have better placement on my serve and just not go too much for the power but rather accuracy, and it worked well afterwards.	4865_2.a	2013-11-02	M	4865	Roger Federer	Novak Djokovic	You struggled a bit with your serve in the first set. What is the explanation for that sluggish start? Were you kind of a bit nervous?	4865_2.q	2.0	1	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS MASTERS	Masters 1000
4865_3	I just prefer focusing on tomorrow's final, and then I will talk about London.	4865_3.a	2013-11-02	M	4865	Roger Federer	Novak Djokovic	The groups were released for London while you were playing, and your first match there will be against Roger again. I'm just wondering about playing him again so quickly. And also, just your group as a whole with Del Potro and Gasquet.	4865_3.q	2.0	1	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS MASTERS	Masters 1000
4865_4	No. Look, I am not upset with the crowd. There is no reason for that. Just everybody has a freedom to choose who they will support, and I felt like I had my supporters. It was obvious that Roger had more, but, you know, I enjoyed playing on such a high level in front of the people who I think also enjoy very much, you know, our performances and our, I think effort, into, you know, into the match.	4865_4.a	2013-11-02	M	4865	Roger Federer	Novak Djokovic	Do you think that you feel the crowd reaction is a little bit unfair for you? You are No.2 in the world, former No.1.	4865_4.q	2.0	1	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS MASTERS	Masters 1000
4865_5	Yeah, I know him for three, four years already from the time when he was playing in AC Milan. I met him many times there. For me, he's one of the best players, if not the best player, in the world in this moment. He is playing incredible. He has amazing skills and quality as an attacker. Also, he's my friend, so I was very glad to see him come with his kids, with his wife. We got to play a little bit of tennis also, which was fun for me. I hope it was for him, also.	4865_5.a	2013-11-02	M	4865	Roger Federer	Novak Djokovic	At least you have one fan, big fan: Zlatan. Do you know him from a long time, or what is the story?	4865_5.q	2.0	1	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS MASTERS	Masters 1000
4865_6	It's never too late. He has a quite good forehand, so he has the potential to become best tennis player in Paris Saint Germain.	4865_6.a	2013-11-02	M	4865	Roger Federer	Novak Djokovic	How would you break down Zlatan's tennis game, strengths and weaknesses that you say?	4865_6.q	2.0	1	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS MASTERS	Masters 1000
4865_7	I think it happen to everybody at some part of our lives. It happened to me, also. What can I say, you know? It's just something that happens, you know. Lack of attention, and that's it.	4865_7.a	2013-11-02	M	4865	Roger Federer	Novak Djokovic	As a separate topic, one of the other stories today was about Del Potro, at a train station here in Paris, having some of his bags stolen and his passport and other things. I was wondering, when you have been traveling, has anything like that happened to you in terms of having stuff stolen? Is it something you worry about?	4865_7.q	2.0	1	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS MASTERS	Masters 1000
4865_8	I cannot recall now. Cannot recall.	4865_8.a	2013-11-02	M	4865	Roger Federer	Novak Djokovic	Do you remember when and where it happened to you?	4865_8.q	2.0	1	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS MASTERS	Masters 1000
4865_9	No, my goal is just to continue on building my game and building the confidence with victories that I have. It's quite important for me to keep on winning and keep on enjoying, you know, tennis. That's what I have in this moment. No.1 does not depend from me only. Depends from Rafa. You know, I know there are small chances. If I finish No.1 of the world, you know, this year, would be an incredible achievement. I don't think it's very possible, so I just try to focus on what I can do and what I can influence, and that is my matches and winning as many matches as possible, really, and building something that, you know, can pay off after, you know, in the next season.	4865_9.a	2013-11-02	M	4865	Roger Federer	Novak Djokovic	Being No.1 at the end of this season is still a clear goal for you.	4865_9.q	2.0	1	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS MASTERS	Masters 1000
4865_10	Well, it's one of my strengths, but it's not possible always to play it at a top level. Not always possible to play it to have as much efficiency as you plan to have. Sometimes it just doesn't work. There are so many different surfaces, different conditions, balls, you know, that affect obviously the play, speed of the game itself, so that affects the adjustment, the movement, the everything. I have been playing backhand quite well in last two months. Throughout the summer I didn't hit it as well, but, you know, obviously I'm working on it. I'm always working not just on backhand, on serve, many elements in my game, and always trying to improve.	4865_10.a	2013-11-02	M	4865	Roger Federer	Novak Djokovic	Your backhand is usually considered a great weapon. Do you think today it is still as good as two years ago? And do you still have as much confidence in your backhand?	4865_10.q	2.0	1	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS MASTERS	Masters 1000
4865_11	You know, I had a few kind of, you know, big, painful losses, against Rafa especially. Roland Garros and also the US Open, those were matches that after when I lost I was very disappointed. But, again, it's not the first time in my career that I'm losing finals of Grand Slams in big matches. Those particular situations help me to kind of regain that experience that is necessary in order to reset you know, in order to find to start from scratch and to, you know, work hard and find the new inspiration and motivation, you know, to play your best. I'm 26, and I feel that it's logic that as a young person I have a lot of motivation, you know, a lot of energy that I try to, you know, kind of channelize in a right way. I have a great team of people around me that is obviously always giving me that positive energy that makes me kind of work hard and improve. After Davis Cup you know, after US Open I went to play Davis Cup. I played really well those two matches under pressure, and I think that that also gave me a lot of, I would say, wind in the back for what was coming after that.	4865_11.a	2013-11-02	M	4865	Roger Federer	Novak Djokovic	You haven't lost a game since the final in the U.S. What was the click? Can you explain it?	4865_11.q	2.0	1	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS MASTERS	Masters 1000
4865_12	(In French.) It's not yet finished. It is possible, because Ferrer plays very well on this surface and he did well here previously. So if I have to play him, it's going to be a difficult match. It's going to be an unpredictable match, an unpredictable final. There is no favorite.	4865_12.a	2013-11-02	M	4865	Roger Federer	Novak Djokovic	(In French.) Will you be surprised to see Ferrer going to the final here?	4865_12.q	2.0	1	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS MASTERS	Masters 1000
4865_13	(In French.) No. I believe all the tennis fans should come tomorrow to come and watch a beautiful match. Of course I hope to have some support. It's very important when you play tennis.	4865_13.a	2013-11-02	M	4865	Roger Federer	Novak Djokovic	(In French.) Do you have a message for the French crowd to support you?	4865_13.q	2.0	1	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS MASTERS	Masters 1000
3500_0	Yes, that volley. I think the balls were new. But all the same, you're not supposed to miss a volley like this one against him. You're not forgiven for it. After that, I overdid it a bit. This is precisely where he's so good. He never misses. He wants to play the angle 50 times in a row, and he does it without missing.	3500_0.a	2011-04-14	M	3500	Rafael Nadal	Richard Gasquet	At 4-All, do you have any regrets about a particular shot?	3500_0.q	18.0	0	3rd Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
3500_1	Yes, it is difficult. His balls bounce high, they're fast. He has a huge forehand which is very dangerous. Physically, he is extremely fit and his forehand is extremely powerful.	3500_1.a	2011-04-14	M	3500	Rafael Nadal	Richard Gasquet	Is it difficult for you to know whether you should move forward to put pressure on him or stay back without allowing him to be in control?	3500_1.q	18.0	0	3rd Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
3500_2	Yes, it's difficult. After a while you start making mistakes. His forehand is so impressive.	3500_2.a	2011-04-14	M	3500	Rafael Nadal	Richard Gasquet	In the beginning you were able to make him stay behind the baseline without forcing it. Is it tough to maintain that pressure for a long time?	3500_2.q	18.0	0	3rd Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
3500_3	Yes, I did. It was a good match. But I have regrets about that game at 4-All. I believe I played at the level of a top-10 player, but he is one step above.	3500_3.a	2011-04-14	M	3500	Rafael Nadal	Richard Gasquet	Did you play the match you wanted to play against him?	3500_3.q	18.0	0	3rd Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
3500_4	Yes, I do. I think he is better than all the others. He is extremely powerful. Even when he is in a bad position, he hits hard.	3500_4.a	2011-04-14	M	3500	Rafael Nadal	Richard Gasquet	You believe, apart from him, you wouldn't have problems with any player on clay now?	3500_4.q	18.0	0	3rd Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
3500_5	I believe he keeps improving. He becomes more powerful over the years and he, of course, has more and more confidence, because confidence comes with the titles.	3500_5.a	2011-04-14	M	3500	Rafael Nadal	Richard Gasquet	Do you believe he's improving consistently or is he just staying at the same level?	3500_5.q	18.0	0	3rd Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
3500_6	Yes. He keeps surprising me with new shots. It is impressive that he won six times here, and I think he is well above all the others.	3500_6.a	2011-04-14	M	3500	Rafael Nadal	Richard Gasquet	Is he still able to surprise you, like with that passing shot?	3500_6.q	18.0	0	3rd Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
3500_7	He doesn't have the same style of game as I do and he's 32 years old. He's used to it. He knows what to do.	3500_7.a	2011-04-14	M	3500	Rafael Nadal	Richard Gasquet	You might be able now to give him some advice for his next opponent.	3500_7.q	18.0	0	3rd Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
3500_8	Well, to have a chance against him, you need to have a very big serve, like Soderling, for example. You need to be very tall and hit the lines, make sure you don't let him dominate the game.	3500_8.a	2011-04-14	M	3500	Rafael Nadal	Richard Gasquet	What should you do against him?	3500_8.q	18.0	0	3rd Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
3500_9	When I was able take the ball early and hit a flat shot, it was better for me. Federer knows how to do this very well.	3500_9.a	2011-04-14	M	3500	Rafael Nadal	Richard Gasquet	In your particular game is there anything you did that gave him trouble?	3500_9.q	18.0	0	3rd Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
3500_10	That's the kind of thing you should avoid doing. Beware of his forehand.	3500_10.a	2011-04-14	M	3500	Rafael Nadal	Richard Gasquet	It seemed to me that when you were forcing him to run forward, it was good for you.	3500_10.q	18.0	0	3rd Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
3500_11	I didn't serve well today. This is important in a match against him because it gives you some free points, which I didn't have today.	3500_11.a	2011-04-14	M	3500	Rafael Nadal	Richard Gasquet	You played well. The only weakness today maybe was your first serve?	3500_11.q	18.0	0	3rd Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
5101_0	I thought I played pretty well. We both were playing well. Uhm, just unfortunate that I lost the tiebreaker. But I thought we both played really well. Did I serve for the set at 54?	5101_0.a	2013-08-22	F	5101	Julia Goerges	Sloane Stephens	You played so well in the first set. When you broke her to go up 54, what happened from that point?	5101_0.q	17.0	1	2nd Round	NEW HAVEN OPEN AT YALE	Premier
5101_1	I served for the set, yeah?	5101_1.a	2013-08-22	F	5101	Julia Goerges	Sloane Stephens	She broke you back.	5101_1.q	17.0	1	2nd Round	NEW HAVEN OPEN AT YALE	Premier
5101_2	Just unfortunate that it went that way. But I thought I played really well. I thought she played well. So it was a good match.	5101_2.a	2013-08-22	F	5101	Julia Goerges	Sloane Stephens	Yes.	5101_2.q	17.0	1	2nd Round	NEW HAVEN OPEN AT YALE	Premier
5101_3	No, she definitely raised her level in the second set. She played more aggressive. All in all, like I said, I thought I played pretty well. She played well. It was a good match.	5101_3.a	2013-08-22	F	5101	Julia Goerges	Sloane Stephens	In the second, it looked like you were down on yourself a little bit. Was that about the first set?	5101_3.q	17.0	1	2nd Round	NEW HAVEN OPEN AT YALE	Premier
5101_4	No. You always have to expect your opponent to play their best. Playing Carol, she's always going to play you tough. She's always a great competitor. Just a tough situation. Unfortunate I didn't pull it together in the second. Like I said, I thought I played a good match.	5101_4.a	2013-08-22	F	5101	Julia Goerges	Sloane Stephens	Was that maybe something that surprised you in the second set, that she got to be a little more aggressive instead of waiting for you to make the mistake?	5101_4.q	17.0	1	2nd Round	NEW HAVEN OPEN AT YALE	Premier
5101_5	Just a lot of matches, a lot of confidence. I've played a lot of matches over the last couple weeks. I played pretty solid. I'm excited going into the Open. I'm looking forward to playing there. Always great to be back in New York at a home slam. I am really excited and I'm glad I got a little bit of confidence going in with all these matches I played here.	5101_5.a	2013-08-22	F	5101	Julia Goerges	Sloane Stephens	What did you get out of this tournament going into the US Open?	5101_5.q	17.0	1	2nd Round	NEW HAVEN OPEN AT YALE	Premier
5101_6	I didn't pay attention, but... She probably did, I don't know. I think she smiles like right at the time that people are taking the picture. I don't know. I know people have noticed that before. On the WTA website, she always has a perfect smile when the picture is of her. I don't know. I don't know.	5101_6.a	2013-08-22	F	5101	Julia Goerges	Sloane Stephens	Did you notice her perfect smile again in the handshake?	5101_6.q	17.0	1	2nd Round	NEW HAVEN OPEN AT YALE	Premier
5101_7	She gets a lot of balls back. She's a really great competitor. She plays her strengths really, really well, and she knows what he's doing. She's a smart player. She's been No.1 in the world. She definitely knows what it takes to be up there. Obviously she's worked really hard on her game, knowing what she needs to do best. That's what it takes to be good. She's a consistent top10 player. So I think she has a pretty solid game.	5101_7.a	2013-08-22	F	5101	Julia Goerges	Sloane Stephens	What is it that makes her so tough?	5101_7.q	17.0	1	2nd Round	NEW HAVEN OPEN AT YALE	Premier
5101_8	No, not really focusing on winning the fans over while I'm playing the match. I don't know. But, I mean, it's awesome to have people cheer for you obviously. An American playing in the States, it's always going to be 50/50. Knowing that Carol has won here so many years in a row, obviously they love her. Like I said, I thought it was pretty even out there, so it was good.	5101_8.a	2013-08-22	F	5101	Julia Goerges	Sloane Stephens	She's been a fan favorite here, only losing one match in six years. The fans seemed kind of divided out there tonight. Did you get that impression and were you trying to win them over?	5101_8.q	17.0	1	2nd Round	NEW HAVEN OPEN AT YALE	Premier
5101_9	Yeah, it's an interesting situation. But I think we worked through it pretty well. It's great to have him here. It's great when he's not here, too. I think either way it works out pretty good. But it's good that he's here.	5101_9.a	2013-08-22	F	5101	Julia Goerges	Sloane Stephens	Earlier in the week you didn't have David here with you physically. Is that a nice challenge for you, to have your hitting partner and be on your own in a sense?	5101_9.q	17.0	1	2nd Round	NEW HAVEN OPEN AT YALE	Premier
1067_0	Definitely.  I could have gone a little farther, but I can learn a lot from that match.	1067_0.a	2007-08-28	M	1067	nan	Sam Querrey	I guess it was not the result you expected after a pretty fun summer.	1067_0.q	48.0	0	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1067_1	Yeah, is that what it was?  A lot of set points in the first set.  I lost those.  Ended up losing it in a tiebreaker.  Lost my serve early in the second set.  Just kind of collapsed.  Kind of got frustrated, didn't know what to do.  I was out of it a little bit.	1067_1.a	2007-08-28	M	1067	nan	Sam Querrey	What happened?  You had six set points in the first set.	1067_1.q	48.0	0	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1067_2	Little bit.  Kind of frustrated at the left-handed lefty.  Just kind of went away from my game.  Kind of stopped playing the way I want to play.	1067_2.a	2007-08-28	M	1067	nan	Sam Querrey	Is it a question of sort of match management at this point, consistency?	1067_2.q	48.0	0	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1067_3	Couple days before the tournament I'd be hitting with some, but that was kind of it.	1067_3.a	2007-08-28	M	1067	nan	Sam Querrey	Had you been practicing against left-handers in the run up to the tournament?	1067_3.q	48.0	0	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1067_4	Never beat a lefty on the tour.	1067_4.a	2007-08-28	M	1067	nan	Sam Querrey	You've played a number of left-handers over your career.  Has it been a pattern where you can't seem to read them, the hooking forehand?	1067_4.q	48.0	0	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1067_5	Yes.	1067_5.a	2007-08-28	M	1067	nan	Sam Querrey	On the tour?	1067_5.q	48.0	0	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1067_6	Juniors.  I've always struggled a little against them.  It's something I need to kind of get over.  Hopefully that will happen.	1067_6.a	2007-08-28	M	1067	nan	Sam Querrey	In juniors, you have?	1067_6.q	48.0	0	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1067_7	More mental probably.	1067_7.a	2007-08-28	M	1067	nan	Sam Querrey	Is it more mental or really just the ball you don't like?	1067_7.q	48.0	0	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1067_8	It's disappointing.  But, I mean, you can't go out every tournament and go deep in the tournaments.  You can, but hopefully one day that will happen.  Just move on and go to the next tournament now.	1067_8.a	2007-08-28	M	1067	nan	Sam Querrey	How disappointing is it, considering you really turned things around since we saw you in L.A.?	1067_8.q	48.0	0	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1067_9	It started well, Australia, third round.  I mean, the year's been a great year.  I'm ranked 48 right now.  My goal at the beginning of the year was to be top 50.  I'm already there.  Hopefully I can just keep going. Four or five more tournaments the rest of the year, so hopefully I can just kind of build on that, keep winning, hopefully get my ranking up there a little bit higher.	1067_9.a	2007-08-28	M	1067	nan	Sam Querrey	What do you take away from your first full Grand Slam season?	1067_9.q	48.0	0	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1067_10	I mean, Wimbledon this year was kind of like the same.  A little bit of a rerun from that.  I just got to take away from that, learn, hopefully fix it the next time I go out there.	1067_10.a	2007-08-28	M	1067	nan	Sam Querrey	You mentioned you felt kind of out of it.  When was the last time you felt like you kind of lost concentration that much?	1067_10.q	48.0	0	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1067_11	A little bit.  Not a whole lot.  I mean, I definitely feel like I kind of let some people down.  Mainly myself.  But not a whole lot, no.	1067_11.a	2007-08-28	M	1067	nan	Sam Querrey	Is it harder coming in this year because there were more expectations around you?	1067_11.q	48.0	0	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1067_12	Lost my serve early in the second.	1067_12.a	2007-08-28	M	1067	nan	Sam Querrey	You were saying it was like a Wimbledon rerun.  You lost the first set in a breaker, then...	1067_12.q	48.0	0	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1067_13	Just frustrated.  Don't really know where to hit the ball.  I start hurrying.  I think I started hurrying a little bit.  You know, those are the main things.	1067_13.a	2007-08-28	M	1067	nan	Sam Querrey	Mentally how did you feel in the second and third sets?	1067_13.q	48.0	0	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1067_14	Little bit.  You know, every match you lose, you kind of learn from it.  Hopefully next time I go out there, play in a Grand Slam, play a lefty, whoever it is, I cannot do those things.	1067_14.a	2007-08-28	M	1067	nan	Sam Querrey	It's maybe an experience thing?	1067_14.q	48.0	0	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1067_15	I don't even realize it until after when my coach tells me.  It's one of those things I kind of -- I don't know, hopefully I can start realizing it when I'm playing, take my time and slow down a little bit.	1067_15.a	2007-08-28	M	1067	nan	Sam Querrey	When you feel yourself hurrying, do you tell yourself to slow down?	1067_15.q	48.0	0	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1067_16	Yeah, a little bit.  I think so, definitely.  Are they thinking about doing that?	1067_16.a	2007-08-28	M	1067	nan	Sam Querrey	Do you think having a coach on court would help you in that circumstance?	1067_16.q	48.0	0	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1067_17	I wouldn't push for it.  I'd probably vote yes.	1067_17.a	2007-08-28	M	1067	nan	Sam Querrey	Would you push for it?	1067_17.q	48.0	0	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1067_18	No.  I mean, occasionally I watch myself play.  If I TiVo a match I'll watch.  Get a DVD.  Not too often.	1067_18.a	2007-08-28	M	1067	nan	Sam Querrey	Do you typically watch game film of yourself after your slams?	1067_18.q	48.0	0	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1067_19	Unless my coach makes me.	1067_19.a	2007-08-28	M	1067	nan	Sam Querrey	This one never?	1067_19.q	48.0	0	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1067_20	Yeah, he's got a good backhand cross-court.  The ball stays really low and it skids.  Good slice serve out wide.  He's a great player.  It was definitely a tough first-round match-up.	1067_20.a	2007-08-28	M	1067	nan	Sam Querrey	Stefan played pretty well.	1067_20.q	48.0	0	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1067_21	Definitely.  He likes that backhand cross-court angle.  I was giving him that ball to hit.	1067_21.a	2007-08-28	M	1067	nan	Sam Querrey	Seemed like he was having his way with some of your topspin shots.	1067_21.q	48.0	0	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1067_22	Kind of randomly thought of someone, called him up and asked him.  That's how it is pretty much every week for me.	1067_22.a	2007-08-28	M	1067	nan	Sam Querrey	You have the doubles left.  How did you hook up with your partner?	1067_22.q	48.0	0	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1067_23	Yeah.  I mean, a lot of it's just kind of fun, something to do.  I mean, I definitely want to work on my net game, serve and volleying.  It helps in that way.	1067_23.a	2007-08-28	M	1067	nan	Sam Querrey	Is it a way to work on your game?	1067_23.q	48.0	0	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1067_24	Yeah, I played Don Young five times.  Jesse Levine three or four times.  Played them a lot.  Know them really well.	1067_24.a	2007-08-28	M	1067	nan	Sam Querrey	Other guys around your age, Donald Young, Jesse Levine, did you play against those guys?	1067_24.q	48.0	0	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1067_25	Donald's playing well right now.  Won his first round here.  Hopefully he can keep winning.  Jesse, he's playing well.  He had a tough first-round match.  He had to play Davydenko.  Hopefully both those guys can keep winning, get their ranking up there.	1067_25.a	2007-08-28	M	1067	nan	Sam Querrey	Are you surprised to see the results they're having?	1067_25.q	48.0	0	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1067_26	Part of it I was playing as an amateur for a little while.  I was having some success doing that.  I was winning a few rounds in challengers.  Qualified an ATP event.  Also the contracts I signed with adidas and Prince.	1067_26.a	2007-08-28	M	1067	nan	Sam Querrey	When you were trying to decide between USC and professional tennis, what factors weighed most heavily?	1067_26.q	48.0	0	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1067_27	Yes.	1067_27.a	2007-08-28	M	1067	nan	Sam Querrey	That was a big factor in your mind?	1067_27.q	48.0	0	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1067_28	Not really.  I mean, it did help that the first tournament I went out and played, I won.  I mean, definitely before I made the decision, there was the doubt in my mind.  When I lost, I didn't think I was good enough. Since I turned pro, there has never been any regrets or anything like that.	1067_28.a	2007-08-28	M	1067	nan	Sam Querrey	Was there any doubt in your mind you could make an impact on the ATP Tour?	1067_28.q	48.0	0	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1067_29	Yes.	1067_29.a	2007-08-28	M	1067	nan	Sam Querrey	Do you think guys go to college less now in the States?	1067_29.q	48.0	0	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1067_30	You know, I can't really answer that.  For me, I mean, when I was talking to people, most people thought it was obvious for me not to go to college, go right to the pros. I was kind of the one thinking about going to college.  I can't really speak for the other guys.  I don't really know what they're thinking.  Some of the other guys out there maybe should have gone to college.  You never know.	1067_30.a	2007-08-28	M	1067	nan	Sam Querrey	Why?	1067_30.q	48.0	0	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1067_31	James is the one guy in the top hundred.  For him, he wasn't -- not that he wasn't good at 18, 19, but he wasn't good enough to just skip college and go to the pros.	1067_31.a	2007-08-28	M	1067	nan	Sam Querrey	Most of the world's top 25 hasn't gone to college.  James Blake is an anomaly.	1067_31.q	48.0	0	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1067_32	Exactly.  Hopefully a lot of guys -- hopefully more guys will start doing that.  For me I think not going to college was the right choice.  I could have gone to college and still graduated next year, come out, had a great career. I mean, I skipped college, ranked 48 right now.  Can't complain too much.  I think most likely I'll go back when I'm done.	1067_32.a	2007-08-28	M	1067	nan	Sam Querrey	You see somebody like John Isner, a different way.  Seems like it's working.	1067_32.q	48.0	0	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1067_33	Surprised me?  It's not really a surprise, but kind of that trip to Europe April, May.  Took two five-week trips.  Came back.  Went back to six weeks.  It can be long and tiresome, especially when you lose first round every week like I did. You lose on Monday.  You wait six days.  You lose on Monday, wait six days.  That kind of just gets tiring, a little lonely. Other than that, it's pretty fun.  I'd rather be doing this than have a job or be in school.	1067_33.a	2007-08-28	M	1067	nan	Sam Querrey	What's the one thing on the Pro Tour end that's surprised you the most?	1067_33.q	48.0	0	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1067_34	I'm going to Davis Cup in Sweden and I'm going to play in Bangkok, then Tokyo.  I'm coming home.  I think I'm going to go back for a tournament in Lyon, then the Masters Series in Paris.	1067_34.a	2007-08-28	M	1067	nan	Sam Querrey	Where does your schedule take you from here?	1067_34.q	48.0	0	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1067_35	Yeah.  Five weeks.  Five more tournaments.	1067_35.a	2007-08-28	M	1067	nan	Sam Querrey	Back on the road a lot.	1067_35.q	48.0	0	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1655_0	It was difficult, no? It was very difficult, especially after my big mistake in the second set. I was playing normal, fine. Nothing special, but nothing bad. I had the match under control, no? 6-4 break, but he break back for me. But I can't understand exactly, because I was serving against wind and was difficult because the wind was heavy today. But with the 5-4 on serve, I didn't lose any serve with the wind. With the wind in my favor, I didn't lose any game during all the match, and I lost the game in 0, no? So it was terrible. Later he break me another time, so the match was crazy like that, no? I served it very bad in the second, so in the third -- but the important thing I played my best tennis in the tiebreak.	1655_0.a	2008-09-01	M	1655	Sam Querrey	Rafael Nadal	How difficult was that match?	1655_0.q	1.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1655_1	No, I know him. I know him. He has a good serve. I think he start playing not very good, and later he play better. But he's a good player, no? We know that.	1655_1.a	2008-09-01	M	1655	Sam Querrey	Rafael Nadal	Did he impress you?	1655_1.q	1.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1655_2	Not today. The Olympics maybe didn't help me right now for this tournament, no? The Olympics was one of the most important title in my careera. But I was playing good in hard court before the Olympics, no? I won in Toronto, semifinals in Cincinnati, and semifinal in Indian Wells and Australia, and Miami final, no, so the results was very good, no?	1655_2.a	2008-09-01	M	1655	Sam Querrey	Rafael Nadal	How much did the Olympics help your confidence at hard courts? This look like the most comfortable you've ever been here so far over the years.	1655_2.q	1.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1655_3	I don't think too much. I don't think those things before the tournament, no? I just go and try my best ever match, no? It's not in Grand Slam; in every tournament you have one bad day. That's the normal thing. Important thing is win. When you are playing not your best, the important thing is win. I did today, so I have a chance for practice tomorrow and for play another time on Wednesday. So that's the important thing. I'm very happy for that.	1655_3.a	2008-09-01	M	1655	Sam Querrey	Rafael Nadal	When you come into a Grand Slam, do you anticipate that, yes, there will be one match maybe in the middle where you won't be playing so well and you'll have to fight a lot and be fighting against yourself?	1655_3.q	1.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1655_4	Well, if I don't feel recovered after two weeks, we have a big problem, no?	1655_4.a	2008-09-01	M	1655	Sam Querrey	Rafael Nadal	Do you feel fully recovered from the travel from Beijing?	1655_4.q	1.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1655_5	You never know.	1655_5.a	2008-09-01	M	1655	Sam Querrey	Rafael Nadal	The ATP is making a change with Etienne having left. You are now in a position of power within the ATP.	1655_5.q	1.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1655_6	For me, most important thing is, first of all, a little bit more communication than the past. For sure, the second thing is one person who knows a little bit about the tennis, no? And one person who wants to talk about with the persons who knows the tennis well. Because Etienne, well, had some new ideas, so that's my opinion. Wasn't bad, because, you know, always when you have a change, you can be wrong, but you can be right, no? So he had the change, so in my opinion, that is fine, but the wrong thing is -- well, never talk for the other people, for -- to consult another people who really knows the tennis, no? Well, in my opinion a lot of people knows the tennis. Tour managers was here since more than ten years and never talk with these guys who know about how was the problems for the tennis for the last few years. I think they know better which problems they have then the new CEO that was Etienne, no? So I think the new have to have more communication with the people who knows the tennis good.	1655_6.a	2008-09-01	M	1655	Sam Querrey	Rafael Nadal	Can you talk a little bit about what you would like to see this new person to do most importantly when he or she comes in?	1655_6.q	1.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1655_7	The schedule, when you start, first of all, the 1st of January and you finish the 20th of December, 25th or 30th of November, it's always going to be a big problem, because it's very difficult be at 100% 11 months during the year, no? So that's tough for the players. But for the rest, the calendar worst than this year going to be impossible. So anything going to be better.	1655_7.a	2008-09-01	M	1655	Sam Querrey	Rafael Nadal	Will the schedule be one of the things, one of the problems?	1655_7.q	1.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1655_8	Normal. Probably I am not in the freshest moment in my life, but I am fine. So important thing, I am there. I am in the quarterfinals. I have a tough match against Fish. Hopefully I have to play my best for the last part of the tournament, no?	1655_8.a	2008-09-01	M	1655	Sam Querrey	Rafael Nadal	How fresh do you feel going into the quarterfinals now?	1655_8.q	1.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1655_9	He's a very good player, no? He played the final in New Haven last week. He played the final in Indian Wells too this year. So he's a dangerous player in hard court, no? Right now he's playing very well. Big serve, very good backhand, good volley. So he's playing with big confidence, and I have to play very well if I want to win.	1655_9.a	2008-09-01	M	1655	Sam Querrey	Rafael Nadal	Can you talk about what will the keys be to playing Fish? He'll be is different type of player, a lot of serve and volley and attacking the net.	1655_9.q	1.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1655_10	I don't have a lot of chance for enjoy, no? I practice every day, I play, so -- one day I going to come for holidays another time, no? I did in the past.	1655_10.a	2008-09-01	M	1655	Sam Querrey	Rafael Nadal	How much does the excitement of New York City fire you up now? You must be enjoying the Big Apple?	1655_10.q	1.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1655_11	Yeah, I am fine, no? Last year I didn't have a lot of problems. I only have the problem in the final of Wimbledon and here another time, no? The big problem was -- the two times when I had the problem was in Grand Slam, so... But I feel very well physically, no? The last few years, very happy for that. For sure I'm a little bit worried about the tennis, because it's moving always in the way for play more and more in hard surfaces, no? Hard surfaces, I think, is more difficult for the body, no? You go to the trainer's room. When I go, I am never alone, so that's not a good news for the sport, no? So we have to think a little bit about that.	1655_11.a	2008-09-01	M	1655	Sam Querrey	Rafael Nadal	Last year when you were here, you were very concerned about the health of your knees, especially at hard courts. Have you solved that problem? Are your knees feeling better?	1655_11.q	1.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1655_12	Everything for me was very, very nice, no? I start winning two sets to Love, but I think was little bit lucky, because he had 4-1 in the second. Later, we stop, I have big chance in the third with Love-40 -- 3-All, Love-40, I think. He served well and then bad returning the 30-40, and for the rest of the match, was amazing, no? I have amazing double fault in the 5-2. Later in the fifth, anything can happen there, no? But most important thing, well, the more special moment for me was when Roger push the forehand to the net, no? For sure that's it.	1655_12.a	2008-09-01	M	1655	Sam Querrey	Rafael Nadal	Many people have said your victory over Roger at Wimbledon was the best match in tennis history. When you think back to the match and everything that happened, and greeting your family and the Spanish royalty, what was the most special moment or memory that you have from that match, that experience?	1655_12.q	1.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1655_13	It was very dark. The last game was very dark. Too dark.	1655_13.a	2008-09-01	M	1655	Sam Querrey	Rafael Nadal	Could you see then? At that time, could you see what was going on? It was dark.	1655_13.q	1.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1994_0	Um, way too many errors today. The first set, I tried to keep playing; I couldn't. I struggled with the rhythm today, so that was the same thing in the third set.	1994_0.a	2009-03-21	M	1994	Andy Murray	Roger Federer	At 2-1, 15-all, Andy took a tumble. You checked to see that he was okay, and then three points later you're walking off broken. You don't win another game. What happened?	1994_0.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
1994_1	Well, now, looking back, sure. I would have loved to go in front with the lead. We had a tough rally as well at 30-40. Who knows if I maybe win that point, maybe he can't play the way he played all match long, you know. So that definitely helped him to stay in the match, and then maybe got the break later on after that. So it was a tough match for me and tough moment.	1994_1.a	2009-03-21	M	1994	Andy Murray	Roger Federer	It was very, very early, of course, but when you had that Love-40 game, did that just set the stage for what was going on?	1994_1.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
1994_2	Ah, yeah, I have those moments quite frequently.	1994_2.a	2009-03-21	M	1994	Andy Murray	Roger Federer	Do you recall struggling that much with your backhand in a long time?	1994_2.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
1994_3	Two minutes after the match I don't know. You know, you're just like disappointed a bit, but it was a decent tournament. Not the greatest of all time, but it was all right. I still had high hopes for today, so I have to look forward. Hopefully I'll play well in Miami.	1994_3.a	2009-03-21	M	1994	Andy Murray	Roger Federer	How disappointed? Are you disappointed? What's the mood? What's the feel?	1994_3.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
1994_4	He's a great counter puncher and reads the game really well. He's got great feel, you know, so he's -- he's very confident at the moment. You can tell the way he plays, you know. He knows he doesn't need to play close to the lines because he knows he can cover the court really well. I think that calms him down mentally. I think that's why he's playing so well.	1994_4.a	2009-03-21	M	1994	Andy Murray	Roger Federer	What makes him difficult?	1994_4.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
1994_5	Not really, no.	1994_5.a	2009-03-21	M	1994	Andy Murray	Roger Federer	When he did go down, though, did you think he was hurt? And after that, did he just play better, or did you just...	1994_5.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
1994_6	Yeah, he played unbelievable in the end. I made many mistakes. My fault, you know. No, I was worried for him. You know, went down badly. I didn't see the entire fall because I was following my ball. But, you know, he screamed, so I hoped he was fine. I was happy to see that he got back up. That was good that he's not injured.	1994_6.a	2009-03-21	M	1994	Andy Murray	Roger Federer	That was a turning point?	1994_6.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
1994_7	Fitness. I'm old. He's young, you know. Makes a huge difference. No, I mean, those are best-of-three-set matches. I think in the last few matches I always felt Andy came on strong, as the match went on, you know. This time was different. I think I played well in the second. Forced the issue a bit more and then played a shocking third set. It was one of those matches where it was very up and down from both ends, and today the better player won.	1994_7.a	2009-03-21	M	1994	Andy Murray	Roger Federer	It's four times now that you've played him at one set all and come away behind in three-set matches. What makes the difference?	1994_7.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
1994_8	No, I don't.	1994_8.a	2009-03-21	M	1994	Andy Murray	Roger Federer	You brought up that you were old. Do you feel the age factor?	1994_8.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
1994_9	No, it doesn't. I usually practice in much hotter conditions than this. It was cool.	1994_9.a	2009-03-21	M	1994	Andy Murray	Roger Federer	Does the heat have an effect on you?	1994_9.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
1664_0	Actually, I'm playing better than I did, much better this year than the last year. What's the different? For sure, top 10 is a little bit more difficult to play, especially the third round that you're favorite of the match. But even today it was like 50/50. I know her long time, and we both play juniors together. So it was tough match, but I'm very happy that I did it in two sets.	1664_0.a	2008-08-30	F	1664	Dominika Cibulkova	Agnieszka Radwanska	What's been the difference in this year for you? Your third year on tour and you're having some success?	1664_0.q	11.0	1	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1664_1	Yeah. Actually I learned how to play against her. She's very tough player, like a wall. Everything is going back. I played against her in Doha. We played more than three hours and I won 6-4 in the third. I knew that I have to play aggressive, not in the middle. Just take and go for it. So actually today I was playing very good, and that's why it was actually quick.	1664_1.a	2008-08-30	F	1664	Dominika Cibulkova	Agnieszka Radwanska	You seemed a lot more confident and composed than she was. Seemed like you handled the situation better than she did.	1664_1.q	11.0	1	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1664_2	Yeah. Actually now is not very easy. Just the big players are, you know, from the fourth round. So I'll try my best. I played against her long time ago, like two years ago indoor. We'll see.	1664_2.a	2008-08-30	F	1664	Dominika Cibulkova	Agnieszka Radwanska	Is that the next step for you, to trust your shots and play more aggressive in the big matches? Because you'll have a very rough one coming out the next time against a Grand Slam champion.	1664_2.q	11.0	1	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1664_3	Actually, for sure, you know, I know her like even from TV. But I will try my best, but it's hard to say. It's hard to say anything about her tactic, because she's such a good player. I have to play my 100% to win.	1664_3.a	2008-08-30	F	1664	Dominika Cibulkova	Agnieszka Radwanska	Does it help to know that you've had success against her in the past?	1664_3.q	11.0	1	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1664_4	I was never nervous.	1664_4.a	2008-08-30	F	1664	Dominika Cibulkova	Agnieszka Radwanska	Do you still get nervous in big matches?	1664_4.q	11.0	1	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1664_5	No. Actually, even if I was like top 100 and playing on the center court against top players, I just know I had nothing to lose, so I was playing like -- I was nervous maybe before, you know, going to the big courts, you know, few thousand people. Sometimes very nervous. But after the warm-up it was okay, so...	1664_5.a	2008-08-30	F	1664	Dominika Cibulkova	Agnieszka Radwanska	In your whole life?	1664_5.q	11.0	1	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1664_6	Yeah. Sometimes it's, like if somebody is nervous sometimes till the last point, you just, you know, you have no idea what to do. But actually if I'm very nervous, it's just warm-up and maybe the first two games. But after it's okay, so...	1664_6.a	2008-08-30	F	1664	Dominika Cibulkova	Agnieszka Radwanska	Not so many players are like that, especially when they're young. You can say I'm not going to be nervous before the match, but then you get there and there's a big crowd and it's a big player, so...	1664_6.q	11.0	1	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1664_7	I mean, I was surprised in the beginning that I was just, you know, playing the first tournament after the junior, and actually I was very surprised that I did my ranking very fast. I'm already top 10, so actually it was big surprise. But now, you know, I believe that I can play, you know, against all these players and even beat them.	1664_7.a	2008-08-30	F	1664	Dominika Cibulkova	Agnieszka Radwanska	Are you surprised at all by your success or at this point you say to yourself, I know I'm very good, and I know I can play with these players?	1664_7.q	11.0	1	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1664_8	Actually, yeah, it's like a big bomb, because I'm first player that's been in top 30. So for sure I did something for the tennis in Poland.	1664_8.a	2008-08-30	F	1664	Dominika Cibulkova	Agnieszka Radwanska	How is your success being received in Poland?	1664_8.q	11.0	1	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1664_9	Yeah. If you're talking about pressure, the pressure is like from -- it's like two years. Actually I'm not thinking about it. I'm just playing my best in every tournament.	1664_9.a	2008-08-30	F	1664	Dominika Cibulkova	Agnieszka Radwanska	Is there any extra pressure, now that you're kind of carrying the flag for them?	1664_9.q	11.0	1	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1664_10	Not for me. Really, the top 20 are the same. Even at Grand Slam, you can see so many surprises, you know, Ana yesterday or before yesterday. It's hard to say, but for me the top 20 is like a top players, and doesn't matter if somebody is top 5 or top 15.	1664_10.a	2008-08-30	F	1664	Dominika Cibulkova	Agnieszka Radwanska	So you've reached the top 10. Do you feel like your game is to the point where you can get to the top 5? Do you feel like there's a big difference between top 10 and top 5 players?	1664_10.q	11.0	1	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1664_11	For sure she can be No.1, that's for sure. That's what I'm saying. Doesn't matter if she's like now, 7 or something?	1664_11.a	2008-08-30	F	1664	Dominika Cibulkova	Agnieszka Radwanska	So if you take a player like Venus, her ranking isn't that high but she's won seven Grand Slams, what would be the difference there between her and other normal top 20 players?	1664_11.q	11.0	1	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1664_12	7. So the ranking is not very important right now, because we know that she's a big champion and she won a lot of Grand Slams. So that's why the ranking is not very important.	1664_12.a	2008-08-30	F	1664	Dominika Cibulkova	Agnieszka Radwanska	7.	1664_12.q	11.0	1	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1664_13	For sure, she's a big champion, and she was playing here for sure more times than me. I will just try my best and we'll see.	1664_13.a	2008-08-30	F	1664	Dominika Cibulkova	Agnieszka Radwanska	Do you think experience will make a difference in your match against her, given that she's got a lot more experience in the big tournaments?	1664_13.q	11.0	1	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1558_0	It's the way he plays. It's a tricky way. It's very unconventional. There's nobody out there to really prepare to play Fabrice. There is no one that plays that way. You can see how much he loves the game. He competes. He's playing singles and doubles every week. I'm sure he doesn't need the money anymore, it's about how much he loves the game. It's fun to see. Not fun to play against, but it's fun to watch. I think fans appreciate that. I hope they do. And myself and him have some pretty good battles. Obviously our styles are pretty contrasting, and I'm trying to attack him with my forehand. He's trying to get a few more backhands and put me on the defensive. It's a lot of fun. We both play some pretty good defense. He's probably a little better, and a little more accurate with his defensive shots, and it's definitely fun to play. Fun to win.	1558_0.a	2008-03-30	M	1558	Fabrice Santoro	James Blake	What is it about Fabrice? He gives people fits a lot. What is it about the way he plays?	1558_0.q	9.0	1	3rd Round	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters
1558_1	Yeah, worried almost every single match. Especially when it's one set all and it's that hot out there. It turns into a physical battle. I'm always worried. I'm up a set and a break and I'm still worried with how talents these guys are out here and how hard he fights. I don't really relax until matchpoint is over with, so I was definitely worried. And he could have picked up his level at any point and played great, put the pressure on me, but I'm sure he was worried the same way. So that's the fun with sports and competition.	1558_1.a	2008-03-30	M	1558	Fabrice Santoro	James Blake	You feel relief? Did you worry at any point?	1558_1.q	9.0	1	3rd Round	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters
1558_2	This hat is a statement to one Pete Holtermann, whose team did not make it into the Final Four and my team did, so I'm pretty happy about that. Yeah, I'm very excited for the way North Carolina's playing right now. I've been a fan of it ever since Michael Jordan. I'm a huge Michael Jordan fan in just about everything, so I became a North Carolina fan, I'm a Chicago Bulls fan. It was just when I was growing up, he was just kind of my idol, so everything about him I started becoming a fan of. I don't know. I've stuck with it. Even obviously after he's gone from North Carolina, he's gone from the Bulls. I stuck with the Bulls even in the lean years after he left. I've just been a fan of all of them, and just about everything about North Carolina. It's actually the only other school I seriously considered going to besides Harvard because of how much of a fan I was of the school and how great of a time I had just being on that campus. And. Coach Paul is also a great guy. So I had a lot of fun there, and thought about going there.	1558_2.a	2008-03-30	M	1558	Fabrice Santoro	James Blake	Is that hat a Final Four statement?	1558_2.q	9.0	1	3rd Round	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters
1558_3	I did. I'm pretty proud of that. Pretty happy you brought that up, because I probably would have anyway (laughing). Yeah, I got one out. All the guys at the beginning were saying there's no way me or Sam would be able to get one out. Sam got two out, I got one out. We both took them pretty deep over the little wall that's a little higher in left field. Then when the Yankees came on I told them, and they didn't really believe me either. They thought I was lying, so I was pretty proud. I hope they got it on video, too. I still have to prove myself to Mardy, because Mardy got one out of Shea, and I couldn't get one out of Shea. So we still have to do that again to see if we can get one out when we're both there. So I'm still practicing for that battle.	1558_3.a	2008-03-30	M	1558	Fabrice Santoro	James Blake	Speaking of another sport, we understand you hit deep at Marlins stadium yesterday.	1558_3.q	9.0	1	3rd Round	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters
1558_4	The wind, gale force in our faces, of course. No, it was swirling a little bit. But it wasn't -- I don't think it was much of a factor, especially Sam's second one. Doesn't matter how windy it was. That one was getting out. I'd like to think mine was. It's amazing how quickly you kind of pick it up. Because our first round, we did three rounds of hitting. First round both of us were kind of grounding a few and just not really getting really good wood on it. Second round we're definitely getting a lot better. Both of us hitting the wall a little bit. By the third round he got two in a row, and I stopped after I got one out. I would like to think that I would hit more, but I don't know. I got one out, and you kind of start picking it up. It's fun to be an athlete in something else that you're so used to doing it. Then we saw the real guys get out and hit and it's a whole other level. The ball jumps off their bats like nothing we could do.	1558_4.a	2008-03-30	M	1558	Fabrice Santoro	James Blake	How windy was it?	1558_4.q	9.0	1	3rd Round	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters
1558_5	Yeah, I played little league up until I was about 13 years old; I loved it. I still love getting out there and having some fun. They wouldn't let me take fielding practice. They were a little scared I'd get hurt. But I love doing any of that kind of stuff. Just playing, I'll definitely be in quite a few of those softball leagues when I get older. All the guys with the beer guts and the six packs with the coolers in the dugout, and I'll have a great time doing that. Maybe be a ringer on someone's company team hopefully, if they don't notice me. I can pull my hat down real low. I love the game and I love competing and being with the guys. It was fun just hanging out with all the Marlins. I've gotten to know a few of the Yankees thanks to them living in Tampa, so getting to see some of them it was a lot of fun.	1558_5.a	2008-03-30	M	1558	Fabrice Santoro	James Blake	Did you play baseball as a kid?	1558_5.q	9.0	1	3rd Round	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters
1558_6	It's going to be a thrill. I've never been there. Never been part of the team. Being part of the Davis Cup team is always an honor. But the Olympic team, it's a little different. I'm excited to interact with all the other athletes. Because, for them, it's the biggest thing in their careers, and to see how hard they've trained and just talk to them about how much they've sacrificed to get to that point is going to be a lot of fun. Hopefully I can meet a lot of new people. Mardy's told me how great his experience was over in Athens, and I hope it will be the same thing in Beijing. I'm really looking forward to having that opportunity to compete for my country again.	1558_6.a	2008-03-30	M	1558	Fabrice Santoro	James Blake	How much are you looking forward to the Olympics?	1558_6.q	9.0	1	3rd Round	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters
1558_7	A lot of people have kind of joked about that. Which would you rather have? I think a Grand Slam title in this sport is what's viewed historically as a bigger deal. I was shocked when I actually did an exhibition with Lindsay Davenport and Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf, all three who have gold medals. When they asked them what their two greatest memories of their tennis careers were, none of the three mentioned the gold medal, which was very surprising to me. I feel like it would be such a thrill and such an honor. But the way they said it, it really is kind of overshadowed by a lot of the other sports at the Olympics. Which I don't know if that's fair or unfair, but it's true that all the other sports build up to that for their whole four years. And for tennis, we have kind of a never ending year. We have four Grand Slams every year to look forward to that are somewhat the pillars of our calendar. It doesn't have maybe the same meaning, but it would be an honor to help the country in the medal count and be a part of a team that's really proud of you. So I'm looking forward to it, but I don't know if it would be the same as winning a US Open or a Wimbledon.	1558_7.a	2008-03-30	M	1558	Fabrice Santoro	James Blake	As far as the competition, how would it compare to a Grand Slam, do you think?	1558_7.q	9.0	1	3rd Round	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters
1558_8	Absolutely. I was pretty disappointed I missed it in 2004, but you never know how long you get to play this game. I've had so many - so many - great doors open for me. So many opportunities and so many pluses that I'm thrilled to have this chance. If it does hurt some of the preparation, if I miss out on New Haven, or maybe a couple of the other tournaments, it's sometimes a once-in-a-lifetime thing. You have to take advantage of those. I never know if I'll get to play again. I hope I'm still playing in four years, but if I'm not, at least I'll be able to say I played on the Olympic team one time. That's something you can always be proud of. I'm always excited when I get to do something like that, where I get to say I did something that can never be taken away. To be an Olympian, there are so many people who work their whole lives to become an Olympian, and either fall short or make it there and are so proud of it. For me to be an Olympian is something that I'm willing to make sacrifices for. I think the whole idea of sports, everyone must have made certain sacrifices to get where they are today. It's just a matter of figuring out which sacrifices you're willing to make. That's definitely one I'm willing to make. It means so much more to you when you make those sacrifices and you're happy about your decision. You have no regrets. And all the parties I've missed, all the friendships, the strain in your friendships and relationships or anything, or all the travel and all the sacrifices I've made for this career, I haven't had a regret yet. So I'm thrilled about that. To do this, I don't think I'll regret it once I'm done with this year and done with my career, I think I'll be able to say I did it my best. The Olympics is a part of it, and I'm proud to be part of that team.	1558_8.a	2008-03-30	M	1558	Fabrice Santoro	James Blake	The hard court season is so important to you usually, especially New Haven and the US Open. I mean, Beijing could really kind of throw a wrinkle into that for you. But you're willing to make that tradeoff?	1558_8.q	9.0	1	3rd Round	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters
1558_9	Pretty sure Mardy got a silver medal.	1558_9.a	2008-03-30	M	1558	Fabrice Santoro	James Blake	The U.S. men got shut out in Athens in tennis. Would it be important for you guys to change that? Is there a collective motivation there?	1558_9.q	9.0	1	3rd Round	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters
1558_10	Yeah. I remember watching it. I was sick, and I was very proud of him.	1558_10.a	2008-03-30	M	1558	Fabrice Santoro	James Blake	In Athens?	1558_10.q	9.0	1	3rd Round	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters
1558_11	Well, I was really happy to see -- over there, I was watching it from my couch. Kind of biting my nails and nervous with Mardy the whole time. But I also saw Andy Roddick in the crowd there. He could have been home preparing for the US Open. But he was still in the stands cheering on Mardy and I think that says a lot about how much the guys care about each other, how much we really enjoy being part of team. It's going to be interesting for me because it will be a little different than the Davis Cup where each match also does reflect on you. It really is a whole team atmosphere as opposed to the Olympic team, which is a team, but you're still out there competing individually for a medal. So it will be really interesting to see the dynamic. But I know the guys that are going as of right now: Myself, the Bryans, Sam Querrey, and hopefully a couple of the other guys will get their ranking up and qualify. We all get along so well, and it's going to be a lot of fun. I hope to be sitting there watching and cheering them on, and vice versa, them cheering me on. So I'm excited about that, and I think the dynamic will be great. We are looking forward to hopefully having some medals. Coming back with some hardware. I remember how proud Mardy was when he came back, and how proud we were of him.	1558_11.a	2008-03-30	M	1558	Fabrice Santoro	James Blake	Well, let me rephrase it. What about the team aspect of it?	1558_11.q	9.0	1	3rd Round	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters
1558_12	Well, it's such an individual sport, tennis, that you really have to make decisions based on the way you feel and what is best for you. I know he's got a very young child at home, and it's tough to take a couple of weeks out to go all the way over to Beijing. It's just people have different priorities. I don't want to speak to exactly what's going on or why he would do that, but I'm sure he has his reasons. He's still the Davis Cup captain, so I'm still a part of a team with him. Same with Andy. He's shown unbelievable commitment to Davis Cup, so I really hope no one faults him for not going to the Olympics. His commitment to Davis Cup has definitely been a sacrifice that may have taken away from his individual results on tour, and I'm so proud to be a teammate with him in that regard. For him not to go to the Olympics after he's already gone in Athens and to be two weeks in front of the US Open, I don't fault him at all. I never would, and I hope no one else does. I see him as a teammate, and I know not many people get that opportunity or are lucky enough to have that honor. But you can't ask for anything more in a teammate, so I'm so proud of him. I would never fault him for not going, and he's got a great chance to win the US Open, I think. You never know how many chances you'll have at that, so he needs to take advantage of that opportunity.	1558_12.a	2008-03-30	M	1558	Fabrice Santoro	James Blake	What do you think about Patrick announcing that he's not going to the Olympics, or Andy?	1558_12.q	9.0	1	3rd Round	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters
1558_13	I'm thinking of going to one tomorrow, watch Johan Santana. If it wasn't so hot out here it would make it a lot easier to sit there and watch for three or four hours. I think they're looking good. I just hope they don't get my hopes up again and collapse a little at the end, but I think Johan Santana will be able to put together a quality start, and looking forward to great a great year.	1558_13.a	2008-03-30	M	1558	Fabrice Santoro	James Blake	So baseball season's almost starting. How do you follow Mets games?	1558_13.q	9.0	1	3rd Round	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters
959_0	No, I don't think nothing, no?  For me, I am focus for every match, no, for every point.  And, you know, I'm very happy for come here, qualify to the master cup, no? But me, I try to do my best.  These two times, really I play very well.	959_0.a	2007-11-13	M	959	Rafael Nadal	David Ferrer	It's the first time you qualified to play the Masters Cup.  Do you expect to defeat the No.2 and No.3 player in the world in a row?	959_0.q	6.0	1	Round Robin	TENNIS MASTERS CUP	Masters Cup
959_1	No, no, nothing.  Just in the PlayStation I'm better than him (laughter). In the tennis, is one match, no?  But Rafa is sure better than me.  He's the No.2 of the world, the best Spanish of the history, the Spanish history.  But this is just one match.  But on the PlayStation, I'm playing sure better than him.	959_1.a	2007-11-13	M	959	Rafael Nadal	David Ferrer	Before the match when I interviewed you, I asked in which respect you outplayed Nadal.  You said you play PlayStation better than Nadal.  Can you tell us more, any other aspects that you are better than Nadal?	959_1.q	6.0	1	Round Robin	TENNIS MASTERS CUP	Masters Cup
959_2	Is the same for me, no?  It's normal they speak more of Rafa, Federer because No.1, No.2.  For me, just No.6 and first time, no?	959_2.a	2007-11-13	M	959	Rafael Nadal	David Ferrer	Do you think it helps you that people talk about Roger Federer here, people talk about Rafael Nadal, and people don't really talk too much about David Ferrer?  Do you think this is good that people kind of ignore for you?	959_2.q	6.0	1	Round Robin	TENNIS MASTERS CUP	Masters Cup
959_3	Well, all the players were tired, no?  But I think maybe me, I'm with very confidence.  It's my first time in the Masters Cup.  You know, I don't have pression. But I think the 8 first of the world, we play a lot of matches, no, in all the year.	959_3.a	2007-11-13	M	959	Rafael Nadal	David Ferrer	It's the end of the season.  Some players complain they are pretty tired.  How do you keep physically so fresh in the end of the season?	959_3.q	6.0	1	Round Robin	TENNIS MASTERS CUP	Masters Cup
959_4	Well, in this moment, I was very nervous, no, because I was a little bit cramping for the tension, for the nerves.  And Rafa is unbelievable, no?  He's a fighter all the match. You know, but I am playing with very confidence and I play perfect in the third set, no?  If I don't play perfect, I can not to beat Rafa, no?	959_4.a	2007-11-13	M	959	Rafael Nadal	David Ferrer	When Nadal caught up in the last round of the game, how did you feel?	959_4.q	6.0	1	Round Robin	TENNIS MASTERS CUP	Masters Cup
959_5	Well, I like Lotto, it's my mark (smiling).	959_5.a	2007-11-13	M	959	Rafael Nadal	David Ferrer	You like red and black.  Which color do you prefer?	959_5.q	6.0	1	Round Robin	TENNIS MASTERS CUP	Masters Cup
959_6	No, he played very bad.  He doesn't play in the final of Tokyo because he retired in Bangkok.  This time it will be different, no? Gasquet, he's playing very well.  He beat Djokovic.  He played very well with Rafa.  I think it was a very tough match, no?	959_6.a	2007-11-13	M	959	Rafael Nadal	David Ferrer	The next match will be against Richard Gasquet.  You beat him easily last time.  Do you feel your game suits his game very well, or he played very badly that day or he played very well?	959_6.q	6.0	1	Round Robin	TENNIS MASTERS CUP	Masters Cup
959_7	Well, when I saw this one, the worst of top hundred, maybe it's a moment for me.  I was playing very bad, no?  But just some words.  I don't think these ones sure, no? Now I don't know if I am the worst player of the top 10 or top hundred.  Now me, I want to think the next match and try to go with my best tennis.  Nothing else. I don't want to think if I the worst, if I the better or not.	959_7.a	2007-11-13	M	959	Rafael Nadal	David Ferrer	You have been recently quoted saying that once you were the worst top hundred in the world.  Then the Spanish journalists told me you were the worst top 10 in history.  Do you start to believe you may be a very good player now?	959_7.q	6.0	1	Round Robin	TENNIS MASTERS CUP	Masters Cup
2881_0	Well, I think definitely the focus today was great. Just the patience in this weather, finding the right way to play in the certain moments. It's a big mental struggle when you have such a strong wind to find a way how to try to play good tennis, especially if you have somebody across the net who is so aggressive, taking everything early and playing a risky game. So I think I was serving very well. It was a very high percentage of the first serves in. Good accuracy, efficiency. It was very important in these conditions.	2881_0.a	2010-09-04	M	2881	James Blake	Novak Djokovic	It looked like you played with a lot of poise. He had the breakpoints early. In the tiebreak he had a chance. What are you most satisfied with how you played tonight?	2881_0.q	3.0	1	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2881_1	Yeah, we played on a couple of different surfaces. We played in Wimbledon, as well. We had a tough one here a couple years back in US Open. I don't know. I think he's playing maybe his best tennis at this moment. He's moving really well. He's serving as good as he served always. He has a lot of talent. He's recognizing the moment, coming to the net. He has a lot of variety in the game. I guess I have to be on the top of my game to be able to win.	2881_1.a	2010-09-04	M	2881	James Blake	Novak Djokovic	You've played Mardy. You know him well. What kind of match do you expect?	2881_1.q	3.0	1	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2881_2	No. They asked me already. I didn't.	2881_2.a	2010-09-04	M	2881	James Blake	Novak Djokovic	Have you watched Federer's commercial where he tried to hit a ball off somebody's head?	2881_2.q	3.0	1	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2881_3	I don't know. It's hard to say. I don't know. If he did it, I mean, have to be very lucky. You know, the odds are not really big, you know, to hit a bottle.	2881_3.a	2010-09-04	M	2881	James Blake	Novak Djokovic	Do you believe it's possible?	2881_3.q	3.0	1	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2881_4	No, I'm doing it every day, day-to-day basis. Kind of serving to my coach's hat, trying to put an apple out of his head (laughter). No.	2881_4.a	2010-09-04	M	2881	James Blake	Novak Djokovic	Do you dare to be somebody's target?	2881_4.q	3.0	1	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2881_5	No, physically I'm fit. I'm fine. I've been setting my form for this tournament. I was focusing on this tournament, as most of the players, because we all want to perform our best and be ready 100% physically and mentally to perform our best on US Open. Luckily I came over that five-setter, and then I had some difficulties there with the heat, not specifically with the physical condition. So I feel okay. I know tonight I had more of the mental struggle to kind of find the rhythm on this wind. I'm sure I'll be fit for continuation of the tournament.	2881_5.a	2010-09-04	M	2881	James Blake	Novak Djokovic	How do you feel physically after all your long matches?	2881_5.q	3.0	1	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2881_6	Sure. You know, I'm good with a lot of Russian players, with Safin. We shared the same agent over the years. I practiced with him a lot when I got to the professional stage. He was one of my idols actually. He's a fantastic player. I mean, Russia has such a long tradition, especially in woman's tennis. It's amazing how many girls every year -- you see some new girls from Russia coming up and doing well. Now you have two playing on center court. You shouldn't worry about the success of Russian tennis, definitely.	2881_6.a	2010-09-04	M	2881	James Blake	Novak Djokovic	Unusual question for you: What do you think about Russian tennis, and what do you think about Russian success of the last couple of years? Do you have any Russian friends on the tour?	2881_6.q	3.0	1	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4954_0	(Translated from Chinese) After all, the opponent is a seeded player whose ranking was top 12. She's really experienced player. I think no matter for doubles or singles, when I played against Vinci it's really tough because it's really difficult to find very good opportunity to gain a point. To be honest, I'm very much pleased with my performance, because compared with how I performed before, I am very much better today. Sometimes it seems that I would seize the opportunity to gain points; unfortunately, I failed. I think that's where I need to improve.	4954_0.a	2013-10-01	F	4954	Roberta Vinci	Shuai Zhang	Good afternoon. There were a few moments in the match where it looked like you were going to really gain some momentum and go on a roll. Every time that happened, it seemed like Vinci took it back from you. Anything in particular she did to make that happen?	4954_0.q	66.0	0	2nd Round	CHINA OPEN	Premier
4954_1	Actually, it's normal because it's okay for the rules. So I will make the best use of the opportunity to communicate with my coach. In that case, I would be provided with very good suggestions. Anyway, the person who stand by might have a better understanding of my problems. So therefore, I'm very much happy that my coach can come to me and give me a lot of very good suggestions. Every time I started to consult with my coach, I think he really successfully gave me a lot of suggestions.	4954_1.a	2013-10-01	F	4954	Roberta Vinci	Shuai Zhang	You met with your coach in each set. Is that a normal process for you, or was that more because of who you were playing?	4954_1.q	66.0	0	2nd Round	CHINA OPEN	Premier
4954_2	Yes. You know, actually, she is good at backhand chip shot, but I don't think she has very good opportunity to win the points. She kept making a lot of changes. In the first set, for every single shot, tough shot from her, the quality is pretty good. But second set she tried to change the rhythm and pace and tried to be more aggressive. At the crucial moment, my quality, my play decreased in terms of the quality. I can't play back to the targeted position, so when compared with my performance in the first set, second and third set is more passive. That's the gap.	4954_2.a	2013-10-01	F	4954	Roberta Vinci	Shuai Zhang	Although you lose the game today, you had a very good performance in the first set, and also especially you have really pressed her backhand. Is that the strategy you got from your coach before the match?	4954_2.q	66.0	0	2nd Round	CHINA OPEN	Premier
4954_3	I think like what I told you, it's not easy to fight against Vinci. She's really experienced. It's impossible for her to have a ranking of No.12 otherwise. She knows exactly how to press her opponent. I think she has very obvious strong points. The quality my ball is somewhat reduced, therefore she can play fully to her advantages. So when playing matches with an opponent like her, you have to stay focused for every single ball, and then constantly produce trouble for her during the match. Unfortunately, I think I only brought part of the trouble to her. Unfortunately, I didn't maintain this good momentum until the very end of the match.	4954_3.a	2013-10-01	F	4954	Roberta Vinci	Shuai Zhang	Is it because of your physical energy? Especially in the third set your forehand has completely distorted in terms of the position, placement.	4954_3.q	66.0	0	2nd Round	CHINA OPEN	Premier
4954_4	Single largest achievement is I boosted my confidence tremendously and my ranking has been increased. Also, my performance is getting better and better. For those three aspects, they are very much different from what they were three weeks ago. From the psychological state, actually I remain unchanged. I have a lot of places to improve. Therefore, I constantly, you know, make continuous endeavors to make further improvement. Next I will have two days off and then fly to Osaka. I have to play qualifications for singles. I personally feel that I have already overdrawn my physical energy. What was your first question? I forgot.	4954_4.a	2013-10-01	F	4954	Roberta Vinci	Shuai Zhang	You have already been playing for four weeks. You lost this match today, which is something unfortunate. Do you feel somewhat relieved? At least you can have several days. After four weeks, what's your single largest achievement and what is your next plan?	4954_4.q	66.0	0	2nd Round	CHINA OPEN	Premier
4954_5	I think the matches have been going on for three weeks, and frequency of matches is even more than what I had in the normal two months. I feel pretty tired physically, but psychologically happy, because you can't win the game all the time. Your ranking is constantly improving. That's something really happy. Prior to US Open this year, I don't have much opportunity to play in any tournament. I physically strong at that time. I had a very high expectation for the upcoming tournaments. I expect that the tournament coming as soon as possible, because I can't even wait to jump into any tournaments. But after this match, I really believe that it's time for me to have a very good rest, and then highly concentrate on the match in Osaka. I don't know how to impress. Can we move onto next question?	4954_5.a	2013-10-01	F	4954	Roberta Vinci	Shuai Zhang	Do you feel somewhat relieved after such a long season?	4954_5.q	66.0	0	2nd Round	CHINA OPEN	Premier
4954_6	I do have a lot of help from China Open. I remember the first time I participate in China Open. Of course I remember that first experience. Actually, before the women's single in Quanzhou Open, I told my coach that when people mention Zhang Shuai, your memory will not stay at the day that you win over top player in the world in 2009. To be honest, I am fed up with the introduction of me that says in 2009 I win No.1 player in the world. I think that was a very good memory; however, it is history already. Now it was 2013 already, and past four years didn't I have any big progress or highlights which could be remembered by you guys? I don't expect people to remember me for that experience only. I'm trying to impress people with even better performances and ranking. Even for the Guangzhou Open, that was history already. They have gone. Starting from today or tomorrow, I'm expecting to have a better performance, to have to better ranking, and then to be impressive.	4954_6.a	2013-10-01	F	4954	Roberta Vinci	Shuai Zhang	This year is tenth anniversary of China Open. You have participated here many times, and also in 2009 you participated. Also you have a very good play yesterday. What kind of meaning does it have to you when you participate in China Open?	4954_6.q	66.0	0	2nd Round	CHINA OPEN	Premier
5955_0	I was never really comfortable. But, of course, I was ahead in the beginning of the match. What happened is I had a very bad period from the end of the second set on. The level of the game became higher, the game was tighter, we were playing very long rallies. He was able to break me. From 4All to 64, 2Love, I was just standing there looking at the ball pass me by. After we played with a lot of intensity, but this letdown in the middle of the match really hurt me. I believe I was playing a bit better than before, but I was serving very badly today.	5955_0.a	2014-04-15	M	5955	nan	Gilles Simon	You almost made it at the end, but you ended up losing that final set. What happened? You seemed to do okay in the beginning of the match.	5955_0.q	28.0	0	1st Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
5955_1	I didn't react well. I felt he was tense, and I didn't use this to be more aggressive. From the baseline he was playing very well. He never missed a shot, in spite of the fact that we had very long rallies. What I have to do against him normally is put pressure on his serve. I was able to do a little bit of that, but I was not serving well myself. On the contrary, it was a catastrophe. Against him, if you're able to hold your serve, then you can put a bit of pressure on him on his serve and you might be able to win, otherwise it's impossible. Every point was very tough, so then I put the pressure on myself. I knew I couldn't miss the shots, and that's why I made those two catastrophic returns.	5955_1.a	2014-04-15	M	5955	nan	Gilles Simon	Why did you miss those returns in the last game?	5955_1.q	28.0	0	1st Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
5955_2	I started off pretty well. But at the end of the match I was only serving second serves. What happened in the match is that the player who was able to dictate the game was winning the points. Usually I serve better than he does, but not today. So it was 50/50. That's why we played three hours.	5955_2.a	2014-04-15	M	5955	nan	Gilles Simon	Why were you serving so badly today?	5955_2.q	28.0	0	1st Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
5955_3	No. This is what happens when you lose confidence. It's more difficult. It would have been good for me to win that match. There were a few good moments where I was able to find a good rhythm and to hit well. But what I need is some victories. It's very difficult to have your first win or the second win. After that it becomes easier. But nowadays it's very tough because all the players are playing very well. They never give away any points. In this match, every time I was holding back, I paid for it immediately. It's going to be a long time before I can really improve my level. My coach told me I was playing at two kilometers an hour. I believe today I was able to solve two problems out of three. If I'm able to stay healthy, I know I might be able to get back to my normal level.	5955_3.a	2014-04-15	M	5955	nan	Gilles Simon	Obviously you're not happy with the beginning of the season.	5955_3.q	28.0	0	1st Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
5955_4	I don't know if it was a good idea to play in Casablanca because the conditions were dramatic. I had to play two 'modest' players. The courts were no good. I believe I'm paying for this now. Here, on the contrary, the conditions are excellent. That means the players never miss, though. You have to take more risks, which was not the problem last week. In this match I was sometimes too timid.	5955_4.a	2014-04-15	M	5955	nan	Gilles Simon	This year you added Casablanca. What will be your schedule now?	5955_4.q	28.0	0	1st Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
5955_5	I'm going Bucharest. I'm going to try to play good doubles and practice well, find my rhythm again.	5955_5.a	2014-04-15	M	5955	nan	Gilles Simon	So what are you going to do next?	5955_5.q	28.0	0	1st Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
5676_0	Yeah, I knew I had a tough opponent ahead of me. You know, the conditions were tough for everyone. I think we got the least today, considering how late we played. But it was still pretty warm out there. Warm enough to have to use some ice vests. But, you know, looking at her results in the last, you know, couple of weeks and last year and the matches that I've played against her, I knew that it was going to be a tough match. No matter what I had to do, I wanted to get through it, and I think that's what it was about today.	5676_0.a	2014-01-14	F	5676	Bethanie Mattek-Sands	Maria Sharapova	Not a bad first start. What was it like playing in that sort of heat in the middle of the night?	5676_0.q	3.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5676_1	It's cool. Feels good. Makes you a little wet, but that's okay.	5676_1.a	2014-01-14	F	5676	Bethanie Mattek-Sands	Maria Sharapova	How did you like the vest?	5676_1.q	3.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5676_2	If I could use that as an excuse, then sure, go for it.	5676_2.a	2014-01-14	F	5676	Bethanie Mattek-Sands	Maria Sharapova	I think you were up 4Love and you had a couple of ball toss issues. Was it the sea gulls above? Were you worrying what they were going to drop?	5676_2.q	3.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5676_3	I was happy just to play, despite the heat or anything. I've been out of the game for a while, so I was happy to be back in a Grand Slam atmosphere.	5676_3.a	2014-01-14	F	5676	Bethanie Mattek-Sands	Maria Sharapova	Were you happy to have the late match today?	5676_3.q	3.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5676_4	Yeah.	5676_4.a	2014-01-14	F	5676	Bethanie Mattek-Sands	Maria Sharapova	Were you watching the matches during the day on TV?	5676_4.q	3.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5676_5	Yeah, I noticed their facial expressions. I'm sure it was very difficult for everyone. I think everyone, except the meteorologists and the doctors, seemed to have the same opinion about the whether, so...	5676_5.a	2014-01-14	F	5676	Bethanie Mattek-Sands	Maria Sharapova	Did you feel sorry in any way for some of the players in the heat?	5676_5.q	3.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4346_0	Yeah, I mean, obviously it's hard to weigh up matches. He didn't serve that well for him tonight, so I was able to be very aggressive on his second serve. He maybe slowed down his first serve a little bit so I was able to take a few more chances on the first serve. Obviously that helped. But, yeah, I went for it like I did the last few times I played against him, and I worked tonight.	4346_0.a	2012-10-13	M	4346	Roger Federer	Andy Murray	Was that as well as you played against him? You played well here in the final two years ago. But is that even more aggressive?	4346_0.q	3.0	1	Semifinals	SHANGHAI ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
4346_1	Well, I mean, when you're beating the best player of all time probably, yeah, it's obviously going to be special. Each time you get to step on the court with him, as well, that's always special, too. You're not always going to win against him, but I've always enjoyed the challenge of playing against him. I haven't won against him every time, but I've always enjoyed the challenge of playing against him, you know, seeing how my game matches up against him. You know, things have changed from the first few times we played, the tactics, how we played, the game styles and stuff. He's obviously made some adjustments, too. I've had to do the same. You know, I lost three or four times almost in a row, or four times out of five. So, you know, I had to maybe change things a little bit, as well.	4346_1.a	2012-10-13	M	4346	Roger Federer	Andy Murray	You've obviously beaten Roger a number of times now. Is there always something a bit special about beating him, considering his status in the game?	4346_1.q	3.0	1	Semifinals	SHANGHAI ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
4346_2	Well, when he's serving, he said two or three points before, he felt the rain in the air, and he just asked if it was raining. You couldn't see very much on the court, then it started to come down a little bit. It's obviously a very important time of the match. If the ball hits the line when it's raining on the hard courts, you can't make contact with the ball, it comes through so quickly. It's completely normal to stop at that point. And the court gets dangerous very quickly, too. We just had a chat at the net. He said, Do you want to keep playing? I said, I'm happy to wait until it stops and just see if it calms down a little bit, 'cause if it rains constantly for five, ten minutes on a hard court, it gets dangerous, so... It wasn't frustrating. Obviously, when I went to serve for the match, it started raining pretty hard and the drops on the court were much bigger, so we had to stop then. But whether it was him that decided or not didn't make it frustrating. It was more that you're serving for the match, so obviously you'd like the opportunity to do that while you're still sort of warm and ready.	4346_2.a	2012-10-13	M	4346	Roger Federer	Andy Murray	Both times it was a rain delay, it was Roger leading the charge to the umpire's chair to stop the match. Both times it was key points. How frustrating is that?	4346_2.q	3.0	1	Semifinals	SHANGHAI ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
4346_3	I mean, it's probably a combination of both. You know, I haven't seen him do that probably almost in his whole career. So I was being aggressive behind the second serve. But even still, that's not something that he normally would do. But it can be tough. The balls here are very light, so it can be tough to control the serve a little bit. But, yeah, it was surprising.	4346_3.a	2012-10-13	M	4346	Roger Federer	Andy Murray	How surprised are you to see Roger doublefault three times? Did that give you an indication of the pressure he was under?	4346_3.q	3.0	1	Semifinals	SHANGHAI ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
4346_4	Not really. I mean, there's stages maybe in matches in Grand Slams or points where you maybe try to conserve your energy a little bit. If you're 40Love down in a game, you don't want to be running five, six times across the court chasing balls down. You might take a few more chances. When it's bestofthree, you would hope you would not get tired in a bestofthree set match. You can maybe play every single point in the match as hard as you can. That's really the only difference.	4346_4.a	2012-10-13	M	4346	Roger Federer	Andy Murray	Bestofthree sets opposed to a bestoffive, does that change your approach to the match at all?	4346_4.q	3.0	1	Semifinals	SHANGHAI ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
4346_5	Yeah, I mean, it's not easy, you know, when you're going to serve for the match. But it's something I never minded doing. I always feel like I focus well when I'm serving for sets or serving for matches. Probably end up getting broken tomorrow serving for a set after saying that (smiling). I just focus extra hard. I take my time in between the points and make sure I really concentrate on where I'm going to serve, what I'm going to do with the first ball in the rally, then take it from there. Today I hit a couple of good serves in that last game, but Roger also missed a couple of backhands, too.	4346_5.a	2012-10-13	M	4346	Roger Federer	Andy Murray	Last two big matches you played, you had one guy holding things up with a medical timeout before you're serving for the match and you've had half an hour rain delay. What goes through your mind? How do you keep calm? Do you turn off?	4346_5.q	3.0	1	Semifinals	SHANGHAI ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
4346_6	Yeah, I mean, I'd say we're friends. I've known him for 14, 15 years now. I've never had any problems with him on the court, never had any problems with him off the court. We've obviously had some incredibly tough matches which can test maybe a friendship. But we've always been I think pretty respectful of each other. I mean, yeah, I'd say we're friends. But we can't be spending loads of time together off the court, going out for dinner and stuff 'cause, you know, you don't want to get too close to guys you're competing in massive matches for.	4346_6.a	2012-10-13	M	4346	Roger Federer	Andy Murray	Can you talk a little bit about your relationship with Novak. I know you came up through the juniors together. You've practiced here this week. Do you consider yourself friends, just colleagues?	4346_6.q	3.0	1	Semifinals	SHANGHAI ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
4346_7	No. We practiced on Tuesday. Obviously weren't thinking about that when we were practicing together. I practiced with him quite a lot before, practiced with him before tournaments, before Grand Slams many times before. Practiced with him here again. I mean, there's obviously going to be a chance that we might play each other in a tournament if we both go deep. He's been incredibly consistent. So, you know, I know if I get to the latter stage of the event, there's a good chance I'll play against him. It's obviously good preparation for us to practice with each other. We try also not to give too much away in practice either. It's beneficial for both of us.	4346_7.a	2012-10-13	M	4346	Roger Federer	Andy Murray	The final tomorrow. A rematch of the US Open final. I think you and Novak are the same age. You trained together here Monday or Tuesday. Have you ever thought about you were going to meet him in a final when you trained together?	4346_7.q	3.0	1	Semifinals	SHANGHAI ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
4346_8	I was just thinking about what I was going to do with the first serve of the last game. That's all I was thinking about. To make sure that I move my feet, don't make any bad decisions. I played Roger many times when the crowd have chanted his name or shouted his name. It was nothing unusual.	4346_8.a	2012-10-13	M	4346	Roger Federer	Andy Murray	When you came back on court after the second break, the crowd were chanting Roger's name. What was going through your mind at the moment?	4346_8.q	3.0	1	Semifinals	SHANGHAI ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
2845_0	Actually, I get good result in Paris, Roland Garros, but after I played some tournaments, I lost second round Wimbledon first round Halle. Played Davis Cup in Moscow; I lost the second point. I played just one tournament in Gstaad on clay. I mean, Gstaad, it was more tournament for like preparation before for the hard season. Come to USA and to play two Masters, what I play not so well. I lost second and first round. So now, it's okay. In quarter already, and I hope I improve my game a little bit before next match.	2845_0.a	2010-09-07	M	2845	Tommy Robredo	Mikhail Youzhny	You've had a little bit of lackluster season, this hard court season. How do you explain your performance here at the US Open?	2845_0.q	14.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2845_1	Yeah. I like result and actually I like how I played today. Of course, I have some mistakes. I was a little bit lucky in fourth set. Maybe not a little bit when I have first net ball and breakpoint; but I have some chances in third set. I think first set was Tommy played better than me, but third set maybe I play better than Tommy. So that's why second set just Tommy make a lot of mistakes. That's it was so easy and so fast.	2845_1.a	2010-09-07	M	2845	Tommy Robredo	Mikhail Youzhny	Are you pleased with the way you've played today? I know you like the result, but can you comment on the way you played today?	2845_1.q	14.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2845_2	I think it's first time in the year I have already two quarterfinals in Grand Slams. It's maybe mean I start to play a little bit more consistent, not only really, really good some tournaments and after not so well. I hope.	2845_2.a	2010-09-07	M	2845	Tommy Robredo	Mikhail Youzhny	Quarterfinal, making it to a quarterfinal in a Grand Slam, what does that mean to you?	2845_2.q	14.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2845_3	Yeah, now it's a lot of Spanish guys. They play really, really well. Why? I think we -- actually, they have a lot of courts; they have a lot of good facilities to practice well. I think it's not really expensive to practice in Spain for Spanish people. In Russia now it's much expensive to practice in Moscow. Not everybody can do this one. I think this is my point, and they have actually really good school, I mean, tennis school in Spain. Before they have only good results in clay, but now, my opinion, it's all hard courts going a little bit slower to previous years. That's why they can play also well on hard court.	2845_3.a	2010-09-07	M	2845	Tommy Robredo	Mikhail Youzhny	There were six Spanish guys that made it to the round of 16. As somebody on the tour, any explanation for why one country that's not that huge has so much success?	2845_3.q	14.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2845_4	No. It's just I tell before maybe they play much better on clay or indoor or hard court, but now I think it's not big different between Nadal and clay court. Of course some different, but not so different like was previous years when indoors courts was faster. And like when they play I think Bruguera, Berasategui it was more different than now. Now Ferrer, he has really good results on hard court. Nadal, Verdasco, Lopez even play better in hard court maybe. Montanes pass three rounds here; Robredo I think almost every round pass three rounds here. So that's why start play really good hard court, as well.	2845_4.a	2010-09-07	M	2845	Tommy Robredo	Mikhail Youzhny	Is there anything that when you face these guys they have in common, like something you know you're going to get from somebody? I know they're real good on clay, but is there anything they seem to all do well?	2845_4.q	14.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2845_5	No, now I doesn't want to think actually about Stan. He still play. And will be not so well if I start to talking about Stan, because he still play. So, but, I don't think now about tactics. Yeah, we play three matches or four matches against Stan, and all matches were different. He have really good backhand, one-hand, but now I doesn't want to think about it, I think.	2845_5.a	2010-09-07	M	2845	Tommy Robredo	Mikhail Youzhny	Your opponent this afternoon had a one-handed backhand. You might potentially have with Stanislas with a Wawrinka next round, face another one-handed backhand. He won twice on clay against you; you've won twice on hard court most recently in Miami, if I'm not mistaken. How would your tactics or your game vary against, you know, Stan if he should make it through compared to Querrey with a two-handed backhand? How would your game plan vary?	2845_5.q	14.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2845_6	What kind of name you are waiting? (Smiling.) Just salute for thanks for crowd, you know. Everybody -- a lot of guys are kiss their hands and say thanks, put racquet up and say thanks. I do like this one.	2845_6.a	2010-09-07	M	2845	Tommy Robredo	Mikhail Youzhny	I couldn't hear what you said on court about your victory salute. Do you give it a name? What is it?	2845_6.q	14.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2845_7	After I winning matches.	2845_7.a	2010-09-07	M	2845	Tommy Robredo	Mikhail Youzhny	Do you practice it?	2845_7.q	14.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
6450_0	Well, I don't know. I think it was more the chance I had in the 43 in the third set. I had two break points and didn't make them. Then he broke my serve and won the third set. That really hurt me, of course. He started the fourth playing much looser and much better and took advantage, and I couldn't come back. So of course I didn't play my best tennis, and I cannot really say something else.	6450_0.a	2014-06-23	M	6450	Marinko Matosevic	Fernando Verdasco	Was all his recent grass court experiences he's had, was that a big factor, the fact he's had a lot of success recently on grass?	6450_0.q	24.0	0	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6450_1	Yeah, but, you know, tennis is like this. I tried to play my best. I didn't. That's it. I cannot really, like I said, say anything else.	6450_1.a	2014-06-23	M	6450	Marinko Matosevic	Fernando Verdasco	Is it frustrating given how well you did last year? Would it have been nice to build on what you did here last year?	6450_1.q	24.0	0	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3095_0	Everybody know; not me. You know, when you stay with the boy and at the end of history you understand that he was with another one, exactly the same. (Laughter.)	3095_0.a	2010-10-29	F	3095	Elena Dementieva	Francesca Schiavone	Did you know before the match that it was the last?	3095_0.q	6.0	1	Round Robin	WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS - DOHA 2010	SEC
3095_1	I think she was really big example for everybody. She leave the tour, but... I don't know. I was friend with her. I am friend with her, so I think was a time she felt good time to leave the tour. Is a part of the life. The tour is not the life. I wish the best really for her. She deserve it.	3095_1.a	2010-10-29	F	3095	Elena Dementieva	Francesca Schiavone	What is your feeling?	3095_1.q	6.0	1	Round Robin	WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS - DOHA 2010	SEC
3095_2	Yeah, this year was fantastic to win a Grand Slam like Roland Garros. I came here really positive. I enjoy this tournament. I think I didn't catch my chance, because I had in every match. But this mean that I have to improve more and more and more. That's a good goal for me. So this mean that I have more motivation to keep going to play tennis.	3095_2.a	2010-10-29	F	3095	Elena Dementieva	Francesca Schiavone	Well done. You kept your standard high right to the end today. Could you say something? This is the best year of your career. Could you say something about that?	3095_2.q	6.0	1	Round Robin	WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS - DOHA 2010	SEC
3095_3	Why?	3095_3.a	2010-10-29	F	3095	Elena Dementieva	Francesca Schiavone	Why did it happen for you this year?	3095_3.q	6.0	1	Round Robin	WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS - DOHA 2010	SEC
3095_4	Because I work a lot; because was a good moment and the right moment; because I found the people that work good on me; and because now I am 29, 30 years old, and I can understand much more things than before, that maybe I was not ready.	3095_4.a	2010-10-29	F	3095	Elena Dementieva	Francesca Schiavone	Why rather than previous years?	3095_4.q	6.0	1	Round Robin	WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS - DOHA 2010	SEC
3095_5	Si, understand. I live better, maybe good experience can make you stronger, believe in yourself. Many things. I think you know what I am saying.	3095_5.a	2010-10-29	F	3095	Elena Dementieva	Francesca Schiavone	You can understand, did you say? Did you say you can understand more things?	3095_5.q	6.0	1	Round Robin	WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS - DOHA 2010	SEC
3095_6	Si, I love to play for my country, so I'm always ready when the captain call me to play for my nation. Now I think I have to rest some days to find more energy to play the last singles of my year. I'm positive. I spoke with the captain, with Flavia, Roberta, and Sara. They want to win this Fed Cup, and I will give the best to do it. I'm happy to do it.	3095_6.a	2010-10-29	F	3095	Elena Dementieva	Francesca Schiavone	For you, the year is not over. You have the Fed Cup final. Can you tell us what is your feeling about this competition, and this final especially?	3095_6.q	6.0	1	Round Robin	WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS - DOHA 2010	SEC
2862_0	Today was tough match. I returned well, but I have some problems in my serve. But maybe I was little bit lucky today that I have good return.	2862_0.a	2010-09-05	M	2862	John Isner	Mikhail Youzhny	John said he thought you were able to read his serve better than most of the other players. Do you feel that way? If so, why?	2862_0.q	14.0	1	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2862_1	No, was good atmosphere, but of course it's better to play not against guy from USA here. Because when is all crowd not against you but for your opponent, it's tough. Anyway, we are only two players on the court. Yeah, maybe can help a little bit, but not all the time.	2862_1.a	2010-09-05	M	2862	John Isner	Mikhail Youzhny	What's it like out there when there is almost everybody for your opponent? Did you like that atmosphere? Did it bother you? Was it fun?	2862_1.q	14.0	1	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2862_2	Everybody knows he has injury before this tournament, and I think he's not recovered 100 percentage. So that's why sometimes he's moving looks likes not so well. But sometimes he starts moving normal. It was tough moment. But when we play in Montral, it was another story. He come after final. I think he play final before in Washington, so he was a little bit tired. But it was I feel pretty the same match. It was really close.	2862_2.a	2010-09-05	M	2862	John Isner	Mikhail Youzhny	You won the last match last year against Isner. What was the difference between this match and the last one?	2862_2.q	14.0	1	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2862_3	Yeah, of course you understand it will be aces. But here main point, if you have some chances, try to take these chance, because it will not be too many chances. But if you can take in main moment like point, it's really important against Isner. And, of course, when you have two, three aces in a row, it could happen.	2862_3.a	2010-09-05	M	2862	John Isner	Mikhail Youzhny	Going into a match against him, are you willing to say that he's going to hit many aces and you just have to look for your spots on the return?	2862_3.q	14.0	1	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2862_4	He start bad. It was break, but he miss I think three or four easy balls. So it was, of course, important I won the first set because I have this break. So, but, after it was another story.	2862_4.a	2010-09-05	M	2862	John Isner	Mikhail Youzhny	How important was it to get the break right off the start? He was playing from behind almost from the beginning of the match.	2862_4.q	14.0	1	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2862_5	Yeah, I have two break up, 5-2. Look like everybody going to my hands. Some points he play well; some points I have a lot of mistakes, and match changes. So after 5-2, it's starting new match. You can say like this. But I am happy, you know, because after tough situation, when I lose the second set, two break ups, I come back to court and start to play again.	2862_5.a	2010-09-05	M	2862	John Isner	Mikhail Youzhny	When he won the second set, what was your mind frame? At what point did you think you were really going to win the game?	2862_5.q	14.0	1	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2862_6	I hope a lot. I hope. But we will see next round.	2862_6.a	2010-09-05	M	2862	John Isner	Mikhail Youzhny	You've now won on center court, Arthur Ashe at the US Open. How much momentum do you think that gives you going to the next round?	2862_6.q	14.0	1	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1010_0	I don't think it's what they say.  I think it's true.  Every time you play one of those matches in five sets, it always comes down to one or two points that really decide the match. Yeah, what can you say?  I mean, the whole fifth set was very dramatic.  I think we both played unbelievable tennis in the fifth set.  I think it was a lot of winners from both sides.  I got the early break, had a chance to maybe go up a double break at 4-2.  Missed a backhand.  It was quite tight.  I asked for a challenge.  The referee didn't hear me. I said forget it and then he wins the game.  I knew if I don't get my first serves in he's going to try to attack me.  Sure enough he did.  He came up with some great shots to break me back.	1010_0.a	2007-09-03	M	1010	James Blake	Tommy Haas	They always say these long matches come down to just a handful of points, maybe just one point.  Can you go over the lob point with us a little bit.	1010_0.q	10.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1010_1	They both felt well.  That point, I don't remember how it actually started, how he came to the net the first time.  I know the first one was kind of just like a reaction.  You know, he made a hell of a get.  The ball kind of like curved back into deep. I just hit the slice backhand.  He came in.  I don't know.  I just felt like, okay, let's try it again.  It went over his head again and went in.  What a point, yeah.  I think if I would have lost that point, the crowd would have gone absolutely ballistic.  That might have given him an extra edge, the adrenaline to maybe -- who knows.  I mean, it's over.	1010_1.a	2007-09-03	M	1010	James Blake	Tommy Haas	When you hit the second lob at 3-3, did you know it was going to be a winner?	1010_1.q	10.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1010_2	Yeah, over the years I think I've learned anything is possible in five sets.  Last year I played two back to back actually five-setters, winning 7-6 in the fifth.  Kind of kept in the back of my mind to stay calm here, even against James here today. But in general, he started off pretty well.  I thought it was a little bit windy out there.  It was my first match on Arthur Ashe Stadium.  He played every match on it.  It's a little different for guys that come and play there for the first time.  It's such a big stadium.  Very overwhelming at times. I got into a little bit of a groove, played well the second set.  In the third I felt like I got a break I thought shouldn't have happened, missing a couple easy balls.  He's so tough and takes his chances quite well.  I kind of got into a groove then in the fourth set, winning eight games in a row.  That gave me a lot of confidence.	1010_2.a	2007-09-03	M	1010	James Blake	Tommy Haas	Do you think earlier in your career maybe getting down and having him playing as well early would have thrown you off?  Maybe the way you came back in this game shows what you've learned.	1010_2.q	10.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1010_3	I mean, it was tough 'cause the first match point I had, I mean, he kind of miss-hit his return, but it was a little bit slow.  I felt like I could have hit the volley.  I let it go because I was a little bit nervous.  It dropped so close to the line.  Then I challenged it.  It was in by, I don't know, one millimeter or something. I hit my serve.  It felt pretty good.  I looked at the line.  When I came to the net, he kind of said, I have to challenge it.  I looked to the mark.  Kind of looked like it was in.  We kind of just exchanged smiles, because what else can you do in this certain time?  Obviously then when the ball was in, I'm not going to celebrate like crazy right in front of him. It was good enough anyway that the ball was good, so...	1010_3.a	2007-09-03	M	1010	James Blake	Tommy Haas	Could you speak about the emotion of having the last point be subject to replay?  You sort of made a slight smile, but it was hard to read the emotion.  Did you know when to celebrate?	1010_3.q	10.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1010_4	Maybe a little bit, sure.  I mean, I really couldn't find too many first serves, I think, at the end of the match that I wanted to.  Every time he had match point, what was it three, I came up with a good first serve.  That saved me, too. I just kept thinking, kept telling myself, try to get to 5-All, maybe then I can calm down again a little bit and relax on his service game.  You know, 5-6, the same thing.  I said, Let's try to get to a tiebreak.  You never know what can happen.	1010_4.a	2007-09-03	M	1010	James Blake	Tommy Haas	Three match points to defend.  You were very aggressive on all three.  Is that just experience, veteran player out there?	1010_4.q	10.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1010_5	You don't really have a choice sometimes.  Sometimes I wonder, you ask yourself questions like why does it happen again.  With the shoulder, obviously that's a different story.  Having two shoulder surgeries, a severe injury, actually being able to play at such a high level again, finding myself back playing with the best, that's obviously, I mean, something I was hoping for after I had 15 months of no competition, having a severe injury. You know, obviously being back and playing tennis is the No.1 and most important thing, being healthy.  So if the shoulder starts giving up sometimes, you know, I just really try to deal with it, try to do the best I can to maintain it. But when you have other injuries or when you get one like looking forward to play Roger in the fourth round of Wimbledon, the match before you get like a stomach tear that's so severe that you can barely walk, then having to withdraw, take another three to four weeks off, not being able to play a couple matches before big tournaments, it's tough. But when you've been through a little bit of that already in the past couple of years, you know, you just try to deal with it, which is not always very easy, but you have no choice.	1010_5.a	2007-09-03	M	1010	James Blake	Tommy Haas	You bounced back from so many injuries in your career:  Shoulder recently, abdominal muscle.  How do you kind of keep going back to coming back from injuries?	1010_5.q	10.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1010_6	You know, you just try to make him play, and when you have a chance, you kind of try to go for it.  You're not trying to give easy points away, which we both did right away.  He missed a forehand quite easily.  I had a volley sitter.  I missed it.  You know, we both know, I mean, this is going to be it after the tiebreak. You know, any time you play such a close match, you're out there for over three hours, that's the one thing in tennis, you're pretty much by yourself afterwards.  You have to deal with the loss.  It's tough.  It takes a couple days to, you know, settle down and stuff. You know, it's not like it's a team effort and you can, whatever, blame it on somebody missing the last shot or something. But it's hard.  Obviously for the winner, it's always such a great feeling.	1010_6.a	2007-09-03	M	1010	James Blake	Tommy Haas	What were you thinking in the fifth set tiebreak?  Did you feel nervous or you tried to play more aggressive or more safe?	1010_6.q	10.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1010_7	Yeah, I do.  I think every Grand Slam should have it.	1010_7.a	2007-09-03	M	1010	James Blake	Tommy Haas	Do you like the fifth-set tiebreaker as opposed to playing it out?	1010_7.q	10.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1010_8	Yeah, I think so.  It's something I have to improve in my game anyway.  Try to be aggressive from the baseline, every once in a while come in.  I feel like if I have a good look at the volley, I can make something happen.  Putting pressure on the opponent always is a good thing.	1010_8.a	2007-09-03	M	1010	James Blake	Tommy Haas	It is part of your game plan to approach shots to James' backhand side, get to the net.  Do you feel like you executed that?  Was it a big key?	1010_8.q	10.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1010_9	Sure.	1010_9.a	2007-09-03	M	1010	James Blake	Tommy Haas	James told us a moment ago that after he had his injuries and family tragedy, when he was making his comeback, that he looked at you or looked to you as kind of a role model or inspiration for making that work.  My question is, were you at all aware of what he was going through?	1010_9.q	10.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1010_10	No, of course.  I mean, you know, I appreciate his comments on that obviously.  It's a great compliment.  You know, I'm the same about him.  I mean, what he has done after his comeback, as well.  It's phenomenal. Both of us playing at this level again, playing in front of an unbelievable crowd.  I mean, it's as good as it gets for us.  I know one of us had to lose today.  I think we both can be very proud of what we've achieved after going through something I think many people can't imagine.	1010_10.a	2007-09-03	M	1010	James Blake	Tommy Haas	And did you have any feeling of empathy?	1010_10.q	10.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2788_0	No fatigue at all. Actually, it was a great start. Was one of the best tournaments I've had in the year, in Beijing. So definitely I'm feeling confident on the court. I'm trying to keep that going.	2788_0.a	2010-10-13	M	2788	Ivan Ljubicic	Novak Djokovic	I wanted to ask if there's any fatigue today coming off the victory Monday in Beijing?	2788_0.q	2.0	1	2nd Round	SHANGHAI ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
2788_1	I mean, he's a big server. He always relies on that part in his game. When he needed to, he served well. Yeah, so there were some moments when I wasn't managing to take his serve. But I made that crucial break already on the start of the first set, which helped. And generally I neutralized his serve, which was very important today. I was looking for my chance in the rallies. I played well.	2788_1.a	2010-10-13	M	2788	Ivan Ljubicic	Novak Djokovic	It seemed like you didn't have too many problems out there today. What was the problem in closing out the first set? Was he playing particularly good defense?	2788_1.q	2.0	1	2nd Round	SHANGHAI ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
2788_2	No, I've lost two challenges by very little in that match. I was happy to win at least one challenge (smiling).	2788_2.a	2010-10-13	M	2788	Ivan Ljubicic	Novak Djokovic	Talk about the challenge. Ivan made the ball outside the line, but the judge called it in. What do you think about that? Do you think it was out or on the line?	2788_2.q	2.0	1	2nd Round	SHANGHAI ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
2788_3	All good. I definitely am satisfied with the performance, satisfied with my game, physical state, my condition. I'm playing well, moving well, motivated mentally, and full of energy. I'm hoping that it's going to stay that way. Obviously I'm playing doubles this tournament, something that I'm not kind of got used to doing in such a big events. I usually don't choose playing doubles. But I have chosen here. Got a little bit complicated with the schedule because of the rain and bad weather, so I have to wait for tonight to play an extra doubles match. Maybe it's going to take a little bit of energy. But still, you know, it's the same for everybody. I mean, I'm fit and I'm confident I can be ready for the next challenge.	2788_3.a	2010-10-13	M	2788	Ivan Ljubicic	Novak Djokovic	Last year for Beijing China Open and Shanghai Masters you played eight matches in 11 days. You said you felt exhausted after that. How do you feel after your first match here in Shanghai physically and mentally?	2788_3.q	2.0	1	2nd Round	SHANGHAI ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
2788_4	I mean, as I said, I'm playing later in doubles. That's why I had to play one of the first matches. I mean, it didn't make any difference to me coming in later because, as I said, I didn't spend that much energy in Beijing. I won without dropping a set the whole tournament. I had two weeks between the Davis Cup semifinals and Beijing tournament, so I had enough time to rest and get ready.	2788_4.a	2010-10-13	M	2788	Ivan Ljubicic	Novak Djokovic	You arrived here late. Now you finished your match first out of the top four players. Are you happy to have an early win today?	2788_4.q	2.0	1	2nd Round	SHANGHAI ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
2788_5	Well, a little bit of everything. I don't play doubles that often. Doubles is important, especially in the Davis Cup. You know, to get a little practice because it might be an option of me playing a doubles match in the finals. So I just wanted to get a little bit of doubles hours on the court.	2788_5.a	2010-10-13	M	2788	Ivan Ljubicic	Novak Djokovic	Why do you choose to play doubles matches here in Shanghai? Is it preparation for Davis Cup?	2788_5.q	2.0	1	2nd Round	SHANGHAI ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
2788_6	I haven't seen Chinese players here playing. I just saw a little bit of the match Ljubicic played yesterday with the Chinese youngster. He played really well. I was surprised to see how many players are on the main draw from China. It's good, you know. Finally the country is getting some success and some players in the men's tennis. You deserve that because the country is very much dedicated to the sport, to the tennis, and they invest a lot in the tennis players. Last week in Beijing, I practiced many times with a 15-year-old, and there are a couple of other 15-, 16-year-olds, so tall, hitting the ball very well. You have the talent, you have the players. It's just now, you know, it's hard work that is in front of them.	2788_6.a	2010-10-13	M	2788	Ivan Ljubicic	Novak Djokovic	Last week in Beijing you spoke highly about one of the youngsters who practiced with you. How do you think about the Chinese male youngsters performance here?	2788_6.q	2.0	1	2nd Round	SHANGHAI ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
2788_7	Davis Cup is a very unique competition where you get to feel the team spirit that you don't get to feel that often. We are individuals, so we mostly perform for ourselves. In Davis Cup, it's about the team, it's about supporting each other, winning for your country. That's why it's a big pleasure and an honor for me and for all my teammates playing in this competition. It's why we always try to give, you know, the last piece of energy for our country. It's been the best Davis Cup year ever in the history of Serbian tennis. We get to play finals at home. We hope that we'll have a full arena of support. It's very important. We are playing against France, who has much more success and tradition in this competition than us. Great players, but we're confident we can pull out the win.	2788_7.a	2010-10-13	M	2788	Ivan Ljubicic	Novak Djokovic	Obviously a Davis Cup semifinal win is a great victory for your country. You played Davis Cup one match after the US Open. Of course you were very tired. Can you talk through the Davis Cup semifinal for us now, your experience with your team.	2788_7.q	2.0	1	2nd Round	SHANGHAI ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
670_0	I think it was -- okay, it was bad luck because I get match point from second serve and he return just fine from baseline.  But I don't know what's happened then. Okay, it was mistake I didn't give chance to play this point.  But then he play well.  Like by 5-4 he just hit from baseline so fast and I have no chance. Just I to try to fight just to get control from baseline.  But I play slow, pretty slow here.  That's why he gets every time coming to the ball and hitting ball make some winners coming to the net. I have no pressure to him.  He make pressure all match.  That's why he won in the five sets.  But normally should I know why the reason he play very fast in the first set and then second set and third like giving up two sets like this and then fighting start in the fourth set.  That's why it was already a little bit different.	670_0.a	2007-01-24	M	670	Tommy Haas	Nikolay Davydenko	There was very little in the match as far as stats are concerned.  Where do you think you lost it?	670_0.q	3.0	0	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
670_1	Not so much, just because like it was different game.  What was different between US Open and here.  Yeah, from my side, normally I need to play a little bit more faster.  I did so many mistake from baseline.  He beat me from baseline.  That's why I was surprising. I need now to more -- now, okay, take rest after Australian Open and just try to consideration for practice for my baseline control and a little bit play more faster, more confidence to get from baseline.  Today was different.	670_1.a	2007-01-24	M	670	Tommy Haas	Nikolay Davydenko	How disappointed are you?	670_1.q	3.0	0	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
670_2	Yeah.  He was get tempo, yeah, faster.  This was for me normally get no chance.	670_2.a	2007-01-24	M	670	Tommy Haas	Nikolay Davydenko	So it was to do with the tempo of the game.  He had a quicker tempo than you did?	670_2.q	3.0	0	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
670_3	I don't know who against he play.  Nadal or Gonzlez, and fighting the same.  Nadal play fast from one hand, and Gonzalez also play forehand fast. They both make good top spin from baseline.  Haas should be play if he get good serve and hitting few balls fast he get a chance to winning semis, but not like today, play good one set and then losing easy two sets try and then try to fight in the fourth.  Maybe a guy like Nadal doesn't give it.  Just trying to winning in the four sets.	670_3.a	2007-01-24	M	670	Tommy Haas	Nikolay Davydenko	How do you rate his chances in the semis?	670_3.q	3.0	0	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
670_4	Normally like I try to be risky.  I don't know why it's was -- should be try -- you know, I know why I did do mistake.  Normally I just return second serve back and then play from, you know, just play baseline. But at match point I want to make winner from backhand.  That's was my stupid mistake.  Because I didn't make in the match like I make no return winners in this point. That's why he hitting to the backhand top spin, and I try to push -- like losing a little bit ball, just try to hit long line.  It was stupid from my side.	670_4.a	2007-01-24	M	670	Tommy Haas	Nikolay Davydenko	What did you make of having Hawk-Eye available on a match point?	670_4.q	3.0	0	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
670_5	Because depends how I start to play tournament and how is my -- how I improve my game.  Normally, what I did in -- here in Australian Open I didn't something surprise myself.  I didn't something do well from my side.  My serve was not great. Okay, baseline, I always play baseline control.  I have guys three round is no special, not like fighting, winning in three sets.  And then Berdych playing in the fourth round was like fighting already.  Here in Australian Open just come, I don't know, like play only baseline and nothing else. That's was coming to quarterfinal but didn't improve anything.  Just every match think about what I did and what needed to for the next match, how I need to play.  I play every match the same, every round.  Nothing special.  I didn't improve anything in Australian Open for my side.	670_5.a	2007-01-24	M	670	Tommy Haas	Nikolay Davydenko	We're only at the start of a very long year.  Do you believe that as the year goes on you can genuinely bridge the gap between yourself and the top two?	670_5.q	3.0	0	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
670_6	Uh-huh.  I was surprising.  I think Haas coming crazy.  Speak by self in the match because nobody's talking.  He say something, talk, just he talk, he can't play in Australia anymore good and something like this. I was surprising what he talking about changing games.	670_6.a	2007-01-24	M	670	Tommy Haas	Nikolay Davydenko	Did you notice what Tommy was saying after the third set?  He was speaking to himself.	670_6.q	3.0	0	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
670_7	No.  Just only one time he talk too loud.  It was surprising.	670_7.a	2007-01-24	M	670	Tommy Haas	Nikolay Davydenko	Did that irritate you any in any way when you were sitting on your chair and heard what he said?	670_7.q	3.0	0	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
670_8	Maybe protect Top 10 is already good, you know, still from my side.  Like, okay, it's great if I do Grand Slam result like semifinal, quarterfinal, or final.  Then end of a year you just coming to Shanghai and you prove how you play Masters there and what I did.  I have Paris, and then I come from No.6 to No.3.  That's just one weekend only one tournament, and then you have big ranking.	670_8.a	2007-01-24	M	670	Tommy Haas	Nikolay Davydenko	Just on the rankings, it is important for you, do you believe to protect No.  3 and cut the gap between 2 and 3?	670_8.q	3.0	0	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
670_9	Yes.  It's coming contract I think after -- I think from next tournament, from Marseille.	670_9.a	2007-01-24	M	670	Tommy Haas	Nikolay Davydenko	Airness is French?	670_9.q	3.0	0	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
670_10	Happy, yeah.  I get clothes for free for three years.  Yeah, happy.	670_10.a	2007-01-24	M	670	Tommy Haas	Nikolay Davydenko	You are happy with that?	670_10.q	3.0	0	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
2597_0	Yeah, it's always tough first round of any slam. Yeah, probably a little bit more so because I had no idea really how he played either. So, yeah, did all the homework we could do before the match. Until you actually get out there, you never really know. So, yeah, he's a grinder. He was gonna hit a lot of balls back, and he served better than I thought he would. But I returned really well, especially at the start.	2597_0.a	2010-01-19	M	2597	nan	Lleyton Hewitt	Fair bit to be happy with that one.	2597_0.q	22.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
2597_1	Yeah, it was tough. It was pretty cold, so it was really heavy conditions. It got heavier as the match went on. The balls were fluffing out quite a bit purely because of the conditions. I think they weren't flying that much, so it was actually hard to generate a lot of pace out there as well tonight.	2597_1.a	2010-01-19	M	2597	nan	Lleyton Hewitt	Conditions a little tricky out there?	2597_1.q	22.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
2597_2	Yeah, well, if you get through, it gives you a little bit -- you get to bed and do all the rehab and physio and treatment and all that stuff a little bit earlier. But, yeah, I didn't have any say. It was whenever I was gonna be on, so...	2597_2.a	2010-01-19	M	2597	nan	Lleyton Hewitt	For the night session, you happy to play earlier?	2597_2.q	22.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
2597_3	Um, yeah. I've been hitting the ball pretty well, you know. Throughout last year and at Wimbledon I hit the ball extremely well and made a good run there. I had to knock off Del Potro, and a month later he wins the US Open. So, yeah, my ball-striking has been pretty good. Ever since I came back from hip surgery, it's more the confidence in moving and getting into the right position to do it. Yeah, obviously you're gonna be a step up every round, though. You're gonna play more quality opponents, and you still gotta be able to strike the ball and get in position a lot better than against a guy like tonight.	2597_3.a	2010-01-19	M	2597	nan	Lleyton Hewitt	You seemed to hit the ball really cleanly in Perth and tonight. Can you compare it with any other point that you've hit the ball this well consistently?	2597_3.q	22.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
2597_4	No, I'm hitting the ball all right at the moment, so just keep it going.	2597_4.a	2010-01-19	M	2597	nan	Lleyton Hewitt	You feel like you're hitting it as well as you ever have?	2597_4.q	22.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
2597_5	Yeah, absolutely. I would love to win it. It's never gonna be easy. Obviously it's a tough tournament to win. Any Grand Slam is tough. You need a little bit of luck. You gotta play well in the right matches. Yeah, we'll see what happens.	2597_5.a	2010-01-19	M	2597	nan	Lleyton Hewitt	You said after the match you always aspired to win this tournament. Does it still have a real burn for you after getting so close a few years ago?	2597_5.q	22.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
2597_6	Yeah, I'm used to it by now. Doesn't worry me too much. I played enough big matches in Davis Cup, and I've sort of had that thrown on me at a young age. Playing Davis Cup for Australia, there's a lot of expectation. Yeah, that was instilled in me at a young age by Newc and Rochey and those guys. I had to learn to deal with it.	2597_6.a	2010-01-19	M	2597	nan	Lleyton Hewitt	Obviously always had a fair bit of expectation on you, too. Are you ready for that to start growing?	2597_6.q	22.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
2597_7	It doesn't fuss me.	2597_7.a	2010-01-19	M	2597	nan	Lleyton Hewitt	Do you like it?	2597_7.q	22.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
2597_8	Yeah, there's a lot guys that are ahead of me on ranking that I think I can take care of. But, um, a lot depends on the how many tournaments you play and your priorities as well. My priority is not a whole heap based on rankings anymore. My priority is mainly on getting my body ready and mentally and physically being as ready as possible for the four majors. That's what I pride myself on. Obviously wanted to come into this tournament this year seeded, though. Purely -- it's a lot tougher if you're not seeded, like last year coming off hip surgery and drawing a guy like Gonzlez. So, yeah, I did all the right things to do that this year. Yeah, if you play well in the slams and the big tournaments, your ranking is gonna take care of itself anyway.	2597_8.a	2010-01-19	M	2597	nan	Lleyton Hewitt	Being ranked 22 at the moment and playing the way you are, you have a look at those guys underneath you working down to No.1. Do you see some names there that you think, Well, you know, we can knock over a few of those and see where you're gonna end up in the not too distant future?	2597_8.q	22.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
2597_9	Yeah, it's not something I've really thought about too much. Where I am at the moment, I was never gonna meet the 1 to 8 guys anyway in the third round. That was always gonna be in the round of 16 anyway, which is the same as if you were 9 to 16 in the seedings. So, yeah, from 9 to 16, 17 to 24, that's not a huge difference.	2597_9.a	2010-01-19	M	2597	nan	Lleyton Hewitt	Is that the next aim, to get back inside that top 16, that next level?	2597_9.q	22.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
2597_10	Yeah, I've always been one to, yeah, try and do all the rehab and get the right treatment and everything. Not cut corners anyway, you know, any time in my career. But you probably do it a little bit more nowadays, especially after having a surgery and stuff like that, just to stay on top of things a little bit more. You probably take it for granted a little bit when you're 18, 19, you know, to probably 22, 23. So, yeah, probably trying to take care of your body a little bit better.	2597_10.a	2010-01-19	M	2597	nan	Lleyton Hewitt	Can you talk a little bit about how much you have to recover from these games these days in contrast to previous years?	2597_10.q	22.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
2597_11	Yeah, I won Wimbledon without it.	2597_11.a	2010-01-19	M	2597	nan	Lleyton Hewitt	Where is the cap this year, the baseball cap? Is that something new this year?	2597_11.q	22.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
2597_12	Um, yeah, I don't know. Probably couldn't find one in my bag, so...	2597_12.a	2010-01-19	M	2597	nan	Lleyton Hewitt	But it's been constant for a long time. Is it just a constant thing that you've chucked it away this year?	2597_12.q	22.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
2597_13	Yeah, both slightly different players, depending on who I play. Played both of them last year. Played Rochus indoors in Memphis in the quarterfinals there, and played pretty well. Knocked him off comfortably. But, yeah, he's always gonna bring his A game pretty much every time, and you pretty much know what to expect with him. He's a good competitor and he doesn't give you any cheap points. You've gotta go out there and beat him. He won't beat himself. Donald Young is probably a lot more naturally talented and he's definitely a lot more of a shot-maker and probably likes the big occasion a little bit more. I played him in Washington. He's a bit of an up-and-down player. As I said, he can hit a lot winners, but he can make some unforced errors as well. There's been big tickets on Donald for, yeah, quite a number of years now. Yeah, by him qualifying and starting to make it through into some of these Grand Slams, he's obviously starting to fulfill that potential.	2597_13.a	2010-01-19	M	2597	nan	Lleyton Hewitt	What about the next opponent. I haven't seen the score, but Donald Young, how do you match up with him and potentially Rochus?	2597_13.q	22.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
2597_14	Well, I don't know enough since I last commented, so there's no point really going into it right at the moment.	2597_14.a	2010-01-19	M	2597	nan	Lleyton Hewitt	Just to get your thoughts on the current state of Australian tennis at the moment, obviously there's some talent coming through. You've made some comments in the past about the leadership of the game and the direction it's going. Do you see any progress or development since you last commented on that?	2597_14.q	22.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1196_0	Yeah.  I don't know if you can put my serve and Andy's serve in the same sentence and keep a straight face, but I played well and served well.  That's pretty important on these courts. I mean, obviously Andy does it pretty often.  That's why I think he's the second best grass court player in the world. For me to have a good serving day is going to make my job a lot easier, make me be able to swing a little freer, especially on my forehands, go after it, feel comfortable on the other guy's serve, which I did today.  Four or five times I broke him.  It's a good feeling.	1196_0.a	2007-06-26	M	1196	Igor Andreev	James Blake	You and Andy coming out smoking serves first round.  I guess that's what you want to do here.	1196_0.q	9.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1196_1	Yeah, it was a great win.  I felt like it was a tough draw to start out with.  Andreev is an excellent player, huge forehand, big serve.  Not ideal to play him first round.  But to get through it is a really good feeling, especially since I maybe got a little tentative towards the end and he fought back and started going for broke and things were going in, which can be dangerous. It can be a time where the guy starts going for broke, making a lot of shots, and before you know it, you're back in a dogfight.  I managed to kind of steady myself, keep going after my shots, play well. To have a win like that is a really great feeling.  Like you said, there have been some early exits.  I don't let those get to me.  I know a lot of those were one or two points here and there.  Those matches can go against you in a hurry, but they can start going with you in a hurry and get on a roll. Before you know it, you're right back where you were or even more confident hopefully.	1196_1.a	2007-06-26	M	1196	Igor Andreev	James Blake	You've had some disappointing early exits this year.  Can you put this into perspective, how much it means to get this out of the way, get it done in quick fashion?	1196_1.q	9.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1196_2	I am.  Four wins in a row, I believe.  I'm pretty happy about that.  I was hearing too much from Mardy Fish about the fact they lost that series to the Twins.  I stayed away from him for a couple days because I knew it was coming.	1196_2.a	2007-06-26	M	1196	Igor Andreev	James Blake	Are you following the Mets from afar?	1196_2.q	9.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1196_3	Yeah.  It helped when I saw Roddick versus Gimelstob first round.  I knew we couldn't go.  I was safe (laughter). But, yeah, I mean, obviously the surface plays more into our styles.  Most of us grew up playing a little more aggressive, going for your shots, ending points a little quicker.  It plays more to our strengths.  I have a feeling we tend to perform better here. We're showing it so far.  I think we got a long way to go to appease the American public's ideas of what it takes to have a good American tennis scene right now.  I think it's pretty darn good with two players in the top 10, Andy being the third seed here, got the Bryans as a top seed.  We're still in the Davis Cup. I think tennis in America is doing great.  It was one of those coincidences or bad luck incidents where we had everything go wrong at the French Open.  I just hope that doesn't happen again for a long time, especially as long as I'm playing.	1196_3.a	2007-06-26	M	1196	Igor Andreev	James Blake	If I remember, after that day in Paris when all the Americans lost, you said, I guarantee we won't go 07, 08 at Wimbledon, and obviously that is correct.	1196_3.q	9.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1196_4	Exactly.  I can only speak about what's going on in my head, on my side of the coin.  But I think having two pretty big stars in the sport of tennis from any one country is a big deal with how globalized it's become. Last year at Shanghai, there were only two countries that had two players in the Masters Cup:  Us and Spain.  It seems like there really aren't very many countries that can say they have two top 10 players, top 20 players even, because the sport has become so global, it seems like it's happening in every sport, in terms of basketball. We had an MVP of the finals from France, an MVP of the season from Germany, last two MVPs from Canada.  Things are changing.  In baseball, there's so many more Dominicans.  There's so many Latin players.  It just becomes tough for any one country to dominate. In years past, in generations past, to have Sampras, Agassi, Chang, Courier, it was so dominant that every American tennis fan would just turn on the TV the second weekend of a Grand Slam, and you know you're going to see at least one of them. You can't do that any more.  Just about the only person you can be pretty sure of seeing is that Swiss guy, and he's going to be there the second Sunday it seems like the last eight. It's pretty tough unless you're from Switzerland to say you have a star that's guaranteed to be there every second week.  But having two guys that have the chance to get there, I think we're in pretty good shape.	1196_4.a	2007-06-26	M	1196	Igor Andreev	James Blake	Could you expand?  One of the great problems I think the media finds is there's no American star except for you two.  There's baseball, football, basketball.  Do you think there needs to be a greater presence?  You can only play your own game.	1196_4.q	9.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1196_5	No.  I get it from my tennis group, from Brian and Mark Merklein.  My game took a little longer to develop than other guys who came out at 17, 18, swinging for the fences, it was all going in. For me it took a while, some trial and error, some bad losses, some good wins, some things happening until I figured out my game.  My game is one that's pretty aggressive and it's one that can be pretty hit or miss. With that being said, there are times when I'm going to seem like I have some bad losses, but I have to play that way because I can't guarantee any match I'm going to win.  I can't go out and just push and assume I'm going to win. So my best way, my best chance to win, is playing sometimes lower percentage tennis, but the kind of tennis that I'm best at.  Those are the chances -- that's the only way I'm going to be able to play and get on, like you said, a streak.  That's the only way I'm going to be able to go deep in a major, go deep in a Masters Series. When I do that, I'll look back and say, All those losses were worth it or everything was worth it, because I have to play that way.  I'm not going to win just staying six feet behind the baseline and just retrieving balls.  These guys out here are way too good.  They push me around too easily.  I need to be the one attacking. That hopefully will turn into a streak sometime.  If it doesn't, I know I did my best and that's why I don't come in here and hang my head too much.  I don't come in here and say what could have been or what should have been.  I know that's the best chance I have.  If I don't have it that day, I don't have it that day.  If the other guy plays too good, he plays too good. I beat myself up in the locker room a little bit, but what can you do?  I'm not going to complain about the talent I have or anything like that.  I do my best with what I was given.	1196_5.a	2007-06-26	M	1196	Igor Andreev	James Blake	You're a guy looking for a streak.  As you search for that, have you had to find your own way?  Have you sat down with Brian and tried to talk it out?  Are you leaning on other people outside your tennis group to find that secret?	1196_5.q	9.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1196_6	More popular?  I'd love to see it on TV more.  I think if people got to know us a little better, the stories that are out here on tour are just incredible.  I'm going to make an ingratiating plug to myself saying I'm coming out with a book because I have a story.  July 10th it's coming out in case anyone's wondering. Literally, everyone in the locker room could write a book.  The more you get to know some of these guys, the more you're impressed with what they've gone through to get to this level.  There's almost no one out here that it was just smooth sailing all the way through.  Like, Okay, I did great in juniors, I came to the pros, did great in the pros, now I'm going towards the middle of my career, everything has gone smoothly. There's ups and downs in everyone's career.  There's situations where they could have gone the other way.  They could have been broken down a little bit.  But to get here and stay here, it's not easy.  All these people, if they could hear those stories more often and appreciate how hard it was for all these guys to get here, how hard they're working every day. Maybe just if it's on TV more they'll have chances to see maybe how hard the guys train, maybe get inside their lives a little bit more and just understand the difficulties people go through. I'm not going to sit here and try to get you guys to tear up with we've got tough lives or anything, but we worked hard for what we got.  It's something that I think fans would appreciate a lot more.  Once you get fans, they're going to get out there and play a little more.  The more they get out there and play, the more they're going to appreciate the tennis that we're playing. I think if we could just get it on TV a little more, get ourselves out there, would be the best thing.	1196_6.a	2007-06-26	M	1196	Igor Andreev	James Blake	Putting aside the question of the level of success of American tennis, if there were one or two things you could do to make it even better, more popular, what would that be?	1196_6.q	9.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1196_7	I'm the author.	1196_7.a	2007-06-26	M	1196	Igor Andreev	James Blake	How are you involved in the book?	1196_7.q	9.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1196_8	I wrote a lot of it.  Andrew Friedman was with me, and he did the actual editing.  He did the writing.  It was my thoughts with his grammatical skills and his editing, his putting it into a story that would probably be better. Basically he's a better storyteller.  He told the story a lot better than I would have been able to from what I told him. We're both excited about it coming out.  I can't wait.  It's going to be something that's interesting because I'm used to a life where you go out, you win, you lose, you answer questions based on that.  Some people care, but most people just care if you win or lose. They don't care how you got there, what happened before, what happened the night before, anything like that.  This is kind of my story.  To see if people are really interested in what's happened to me the last few years.	1196_8.a	2007-06-26	M	1196	Igor Andreev	James Blake	Did you sit down and write it?	1196_8.q	9.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1196_9	Sort of.  I don't obviously have the time to just go on a full-fledged book tour.  I'm going to do some signings in New York right after Wimbledon.  I'm going to try to incorporate it with most of the tournaments, going out to L.A. playing there, I'll do some book signing. Same with Indianapolis, at the US Open, at the Pilot Pen.  So I'll could a lot of book signings and things.  I can't obviously do just a full-fledged book tour unfortunately.  But I'm going to do everything I can for promotions.  I'm going to be on a lot of the kind of talk shows and things like that in the States hopefully promoting it.  We'll see if it sells a few.	1196_9.a	2007-06-26	M	1196	Igor Andreev	James Blake	Are you going to make a tour?	1196_9.q	9.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1196_10	I think he's going to break it.  I think he's going to go down as the greatest home run hitter ever, obviously.  Unfortunately for him I think a lot of the fans, the media as well, is going to wonder if there should be an asterisk there. It's unfortunate.  It's really unfortunate for him if he is clean.  If he's not clean, it's really unfortunate for the game.  So that's kind of the way I look at it.	1196_10.a	2007-06-26	M	1196	Igor Andreev	James Blake	You mentioned you're a Mets fan.  Are you also following Barry Bonds' home run chase?	1196_10.q	9.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1196_11	I think just over 200 pages.  Hopefully it's not as rambling as most of my interview answers are.  That's what Andrew is there for.  He could cut me off if he needed to.	1196_11.a	2007-06-26	M	1196	Igor Andreev	James Blake	You're known for some rather lengthy interview transcripts, which we all enjoy by the way.  How long is your book?	1196_11.q	9.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1196_12	Yeah, well, I think first and foremost, the line should be that my book stays in the non-fiction section.  That for me is one thing that was important to me. Otherwise, yeah, I really do think things that happen in the locker room, stories that we do tell, like I said, I have a million stories about tons of guys in the locker room, and most of them are very impressive.  Most of them I would love to share, but I would never do it unless they shared it. If some of these guys want to tell you their stories then that's up to them.  It's not anyone else's business to go out and tell stories about other people.  That's why my book is about me and my family.  Everyone that's in the book, every interview that was done by Andrew, with all my friends, were consented to.  There's nothing in there that someone is going to come out and be -- hopefully not -- going to be upset about, saying, I didn't say that; I didn't do that. Hopefully there's no controversy whatsoever because I didn't bring locker room stuff into it.	1196_12.a	2007-06-26	M	1196	Igor Andreev	James Blake	Last year you were critical of Vince Spadea in terms of his revealing locker room information.  Did you reflect on that issue, how much athletes should reveal, where the line is?	1196_12.q	9.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1196_13	Breaking Back.	1196_13.a	2007-06-26	M	1196	Igor Andreev	James Blake	What's the name of it?	1196_13.q	9.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1196_14	Dent unfortunately has been injured for a long time.  We don't know how his back will ever react again.  Mardy has a tough draw here.  Robby had a pretty tough draw.  To play a former quarterfinalist, last year's finalist, is not easy. They're working hard.  They're doing their best.  It's tough when you don't get seeded because you end up with those tough draws. Like I said before, if you want to beg to differ, that's up to you, but we've got two guys in the top 10.  We have the best doubles team in the world.  We're probably the favorite right now to win Davis Cup.  If the expectations are higher than that, I'm sorry.  I'm doing my best.  It's pretty -- those are pretty lofty expectations then.	1196_14.a	2007-06-26	M	1196	Igor Andreev	James Blake	If I could beg to differ with what you said before about Americans.  You and Andy are actually the only ones that won so far here.  I'm wondering if we're at the point, post the fab four era, we need to set the bar lower but seriously set it lower about the results people like Ginepri and Fish and Dent and these guys are going to put up?	1196_14.q	9.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
332_0	I think he play really well today everything. Serve, I didn't have any chance. Also, his forehand, also backhand, he hit some winners from back of the baseline. I think he close his eyes and hitting so many winners. Couldn't really stop him today. So I don't think I really play bad. Maybe I could do little better everything, but I think he played well today.	332_0.a	2015-04-02	M	332	John Isner	Kei Nishikori	You had never played him before. Can you talk about how difficult it is to face him when he's playing that well and how you felt you played today.	332_0.q	5.0	0	Quarterfinals	MIAMI OPEN PRESENTED BY ITAU	Masters 1000
332_1	Of course it's really disappointing lose today, but I had a good three matches before here. I think I'm playing good again. So I could a little better in Indian Wells. I never play well there. So maybe next year try to do well Indian Wells. This could be better, but it was good week, playing good tennis. I had confidence again, so I think it's becoming good. (Smiling.)	332_1.a	2015-04-02	M	332	John Isner	Kei Nishikori	Just a little sum up of Indian Wells/Miami. How do you feel you did in these two events?	332_1.q	5.0	0	Quarterfinals	MIAMI OPEN PRESENTED BY ITAU	Masters 1000
332_2	I think the big reason is he doesn't give you good rhythm in your strokes. He try to hits winners from everywhere, so there is no long rallies. For me, it's tough to have good rhythm my strokes. And also, he was serving great today. So, yeah, I need a little more focus on my first service game, and that's something I to have work on next time.	332_2.a	2015-04-02	M	332	John Isner	Kei Nishikori	When you're playing someone like Milos Raonic who is also a big sever you find your way into his serve. What makes it different with John Isner?	332_2.q	5.0	0	Quarterfinals	MIAMI OPEN PRESENTED BY ITAU	Masters 1000
332_3	Usually, yes. You know, when you play with big servers it's not fun actually. It's never easy play against those big servers. But something I have to challenge next time.	332_3.a	2015-04-02	M	332	John Isner	Kei Nishikori	Do you feel more frustration playing somebody like Isner because you can't maybe develop your game?	332_3.q	5.0	0	Quarterfinals	MIAMI OPEN PRESENTED BY ITAU	Masters 1000
332_4	It was tough, you know, especially we never play before, so I didn't really read his serve. And also second serve he was hitting big, so it was tough to return.	332_4.a	2015-04-02	M	332	John Isner	Kei Nishikori	How much do you have to guess at where he's going with his serve?	332_4.q	5.0	0	Quarterfinals	MIAMI OPEN PRESENTED BY ITAU	Masters 1000
332_5	Sorry?	332_5.a	2015-04-02	M	332	John Isner	Kei Nishikori	Is that the best anyone has ever served against you?	332_5.q	5.0	0	Quarterfinals	MIAMI OPEN PRESENTED BY ITAU	Masters 1000
332_6	I think so, yes. I think, yeah, s tougher than  I mean, Milos is tough, tough serve. But I think he has more height, so felt like it's coming from somewhere different. (Smiling.)	332_6.a	2015-04-02	M	332	John Isner	Kei Nishikori	Is that the most anyone has ever shut you down with a serve in a match?	332_6.q	5.0	0	Quarterfinals	MIAMI OPEN PRESENTED BY ITAU	Masters 1000
332_7	Well, yeah, it was tough situation, especially with this guy shouldn't really break my serve. But I was trying to find one chance again. I was more focusing my service game. That's where I couldn't really have enough time to think about for my return game.	332_7.a	2015-04-02	M	332	John Isner	Kei Nishikori	What are you thinking when you go down a break in the second and a guy is serving like that? Are you fighting the feeling that's it's hopeless, or are you telling yourself you can always get back in?	332_7.q	5.0	0	Quarterfinals	MIAMI OPEN PRESENTED BY ITAU	Masters 1000
1101_0	No.	1101_0.a	2007-08-15	M	1101	Novak Djokovic	Carlos Moya	Did you watch Novak last week at all?	1101_0.q	19.0	1	2nd Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP MASTERS	Masters
1101_1	Yeah.	1101_1.a	2007-08-15	M	1101	Novak Djokovic	Carlos Moya	You've played him before and been successful.	1101_1.q	19.0	1	2nd Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP MASTERS	Masters
1101_2	Well, I know how he plays.  We played each other a couple times and I really follow him because I like his style, his kind of game.  I wouldn't say his game suits me.  I guess every match is a different story, and today I think I played very well.  I serve well and hit very hard with my forehand. You know, I felt very confident on the court and I knew I was going to have a good chance to beat him given the conditions coming from winning in Montreal, 7-6 in the third beating Federer.  He's just twenty years old, and I've been in his situation so I know what you think.  I know how you feel. I knew it was going to be tough for him.  I was coming from beating Nalbandian so I'm more in the rhythm of the competition here in Cincinnati.  Everything is different for him.  I think all these conditions made that this victory was possible for me.	1101_2.a	2007-08-15	M	1101	Novak Djokovic	Carlos Moya	Is there something about his game that suits you?	1101_2.q	19.0	1	2nd Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP MASTERS	Masters
1101_3	Yeah.  Not only physical but mentally.  I think he's still thinking about the great week he had in Montreal beating the top three players in the world.  So I knew the beginning was going to be hard for him to get into the match.  I knew I was going to have my chances there and I was going to have to take them.  That's what I did. I was very prepared for this match and everything went the way I thought.  Also I had to play very well.  I played one of the best matches of the year.  You know, it's a very good win for me, but I have to think about my next opponent now.	1101_3.a	2007-08-15	M	1101	Novak Djokovic	Carlos Moya	When you're at his level and just getting into the top 5 and playing late in the tournaments and having to go to a new tournament quickly, does it take time to get used that physically?	1101_3.q	19.0	1	2nd Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP MASTERS	Masters
1101_4	It helps.  Obviously I'd rather have a bye the first round than having to having to play Nalbandian the first round.  But if you get to win that first round you're in a better position.  I have always said that the first round is always dangerous, and even more for a top player, so I try to take advantage of that. I been in his situation and now I'm in another situation that if you win that first rounds you have a little bit advantage from your point.	1101_4.a	2007-08-15	M	1101	Novak Djokovic	Carlos Moya	You mentioned it a little bit, but how much do you think that it helped you that he had a first round bye and you had a match coming into today's match?	1101_4.q	19.0	1	2nd Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP MASTERS	Masters
1101_5	Yeah.  I think everybody -- for everybody it's difficult to win a tournament and go to the next one.  Also the way he won the tournament.  He beat Roddick, Federer, Nadal.  It's normal.  It's a Masters Series and it's normal that at the beginning when he comes here takes a while for him to get into the match. But I knew that would happen and I knew it was very normal that this can happen to him, so I try to take advantage of that.	1101_5.a	2007-08-15	M	1101	Novak Djokovic	Carlos Moya	When you were coming up, did you feel that same way that he does now about going deep in the tournaments then that first round of the next tournament is really, really tough.  Did you struggle with that as well?	1101_5.q	19.0	1	2nd Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP MASTERS	Masters
1101_6	Well, on a given day he can beat any of these guys like that.  He prove that last week.  It's keeping the level for so many weeks.  He's always at least in the semifinal, so I think before next year he could be ready to try to become No.1. This year he's behind for too many points already, but in one year I think he could be able to be there with them.  After Rafa and Roger I think he's the next player for sure.	1101_6.a	2007-08-15	M	1101	Novak Djokovic	Carlos Moya	He has risen through the rankings so quickly.  Besides today when he did not seem to play very well, how close is he to No.1 and No.2?	1101_6.q	19.0	1	2nd Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP MASTERS	Masters
1101_7	Yeah, for sure.	1101_7.a	2007-08-15	M	1101	Novak Djokovic	Carlos Moya	Is he a reasonable favorite or maybe a second or third favorite for the US Open?	1101_7.q	19.0	1	2nd Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP MASTERS	Masters
1101_8	No, but one of the good ones.	1101_8.a	2007-08-15	M	1101	Novak Djokovic	Carlos Moya	Did you say this was the best match you played this year?	1101_8.q	19.0	1	2nd Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP MASTERS	Masters
1101_9	Well, maybe.  Maybe.  I remember that year I was serving really well and hitting forehand very well, so it's the same way I feeling this week so far.  I beat two of the best players in the world.  Nalbandian is 20 something in the ranking but he's a lot better than his ranking shows. Novak a No.3 in the world coming from winning Montreal.  So my tennis right now is very good.  I'll just try to play at the same level the next matches and who knows what can happen.  But I'm feeling well and happy and enjoying on court, and that's good.	1101_9.a	2007-08-15	M	1101	Novak Djokovic	Carlos Moya	Did you play at the same level when you won this tournament over here?	1101_9.q	19.0	1	2nd Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP MASTERS	Masters
1101_10	Well, I didn't get to talk to the other guys, but in my case, I just think about my next match.  That's it.  I don't even know who I'm playing if I win tomorrow, so please don't tell me.  But I just want to go step by step.  Tomorrow is going much more difficult.  Much than today, and I expect to have a very tough battle against Del Potro. If I win I'll see who I'm playing, but to me doesn't matter that Djokovic lost and Nadal lost.  Just want to go step by step.  That's it.  Probably Federer is happy about what happened today, so he's the only one who can really think about these things happen today.  Not the other players, I guess.  We have to go match by match.	1101_10.a	2007-08-15	M	1101	Novak Djokovic	Carlos Moya	How much does it change the way that players look at who can possibly win this tournament when a day like today happens when Nadal and Djokovic both go out?	1101_10.q	19.0	1	2nd Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP MASTERS	Masters
2325_0	You could probably say that. I think it's my first ATP victory, too. It's been a lot of years. I'm pretty sure it's my first ATP victory at that level.	2325_0.a	2009-09-01	M	2325	Igor Andreev	Jesse Witten	Biggest win of your career?	2325_0.q	276.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2325_1	Actually, I don't know.	2325_1.a	2009-09-01	M	2325	Igor Andreev	Jesse Witten	What happened?	2325_1.q	276.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2325_2	I don't know what's happening. Last couple weeks I've been playing well, and I'm not even sure why. I'm just going to roll with it. I'm hitting the ball well. I'm kind of dictating play well without making a lot of errors. Everything is bugging a lot of guys, even a guy like him who is so good. I really don't know what to say about it. I'm not going to argue it.	2325_2.a	2009-09-01	M	2325	Igor Andreev	Jesse Witten	That guy is seeded. He's a good player.	2325_2.q	276.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2325_3	Right.	2325_3.a	2009-09-01	M	2325	Igor Andreev	Jesse Witten	We talked to Devin Britton yesterday; similar response. First time out. He was sort of amazed. He was in awe of Roger Federer, et cetera.	2325_3.q	276.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2325_4	Well, I mean, I've been here before. I've played three quallies matches now. We're on the outside-courts. I feel comfortable out there. It was a good crowd. I mean, I feel like I had a lot of support, a lot of friends and a lot of family. So, I mean, I felt comfortable. I didn't feel overwhelmed at all. Usually I'm kind of nervous when you walk out there. But from the first point on, I didn't feel too many nerves. I was comfortable. Helped me get right into it rather than lose a few games early in order to get into the match. So that probably helped, a quick start.	2325_4.a	2009-09-01	M	2325	Igor Andreev	Jesse Witten	What was your mindset taking the court?	2325_4.q	276.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2325_5	I was trying not to think about it. I mean, when I was up in the first set 5-2 serving for it, I kind of let a bad game go by and it got a little close. I started to think about it a little bit. I was able to rebound. A lot of times that's when I struggled, is rebounding from a bad game or a game that kind of slipped away where you should have closed it out. I think that's the big thing this week I did.	2325_5.a	2009-09-01	M	2325	Igor Andreev	Jesse Witten	Were you surprised?	2325_5.q	276.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2325_6	I mean, you're not going to find me saying don't go to - I love -- I'd go back to college right now if I could. I loved college and everything about it. I feel like the team aspect of it is great. I love having the team, having friends that you live with and play and practice and do everything together. It's just a great atmosphere. I got a lot better at college. I had a lot of offers to kind of bypass college and go right into playing and traveling, but I didn't want to do that 30-some weeks a year. I mean, I was 18 or 17, whatever. I just -- it wasn't me. So I kind of just stuck it, graduated, and went that path. I'm glad I did.	2325_6.a	2009-09-01	M	2325	Igor Andreev	Jesse Witten	We saw John Isner yesterday. Is this an argument to go to college?	2325_6.q	276.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2325_7	Yeah, you know, it's doing great for me. (laughter.) No, it was actually good at the time, if you're getting injured. I mean, it's a lot of like exercise science basically. So if you're getting injured and you know how the body is working and what you need to do if you're getting fatigued and stuff like that, I mean, it's a broad spectrum. It's great for athletes because it kind of shows and teaches you what's going on with your body when you're playing sports at a high level.	2325_7.a	2009-09-01	M	2325	Igor Andreev	Jesse Witten	How is that kinesiology?	2325_7.q	276.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2325_8	No, I mean, I think -- I think it's -- I don't know. There's a couple of guys, obviously, that can skip college and get away with it. But, I mean, there are so many guys that are at the mediocre level, or where we're at, the 200 to the whatever. I know there's a lot of them, but 200 to 300 or 400 realistically. There are so many guys that kind of skipped college, and I know 'em now and they kind of regret it. Actually there are a couple of my friends going back. I think it's great. I was in the SEC, so we were playing top 10 guys every week, every other day. So I mean, you had to be ready.	2325_8.a	2009-09-01	M	2325	Igor Andreev	Jesse Witten	Are you at all surprised? He mentioned John Isner. There were many college athletes here yesterday. A lot of them won yesterday. Does that surprise you at all?	2325_8.q	276.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2325_9	Right, SEC. We don't, but... Unless there's football games on. We leave the tennis out of it. More basketball.	2325_9.a	2009-09-01	M	2325	Igor Andreev	Jesse Witten	In this tournament, there's all these college people -- do you guys talk about this at all?	2325_9.q	276.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2325_10	That's more than I made all year. Is that right? With the team tennis though, I always do the team tennis here. I play for the New York team, which is always fun. Ever since that, I guess we'll have to give that the credit. I've been on a roll. I played with Kendrick, and we had Abigail Spears feel and Fusano on our team. There as a lot of good practices. You play a lot of guys. It's kind of like this atmosphere: they're loud, you get some rowdy fans, and they get behind you. Anything like that with a college atmosphere, rowdy people, New York, it's fun.	2325_10.a	2009-09-01	M	2325	Igor Andreev	Jesse Witten	It's like 30 Gs getting to the second round. What are you going to do with it?	2325_10.q	276.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2325_11	I had some of my teammates, actually. They came up. They kind of follow me whenever I can. Whenever I get to a big show, they're definitely there. They're always supporting me.	2325_11.a	2009-09-01	M	2325	Igor Andreev	Jesse Witten	Were there some folks from Kentucky up there?	2325_11.q	276.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2325_12	If I let them stay in my room, (laughter) which they have been. So I mean... We had like five people -- I mean, don't tell the hotel, but... No, yeah, I'd be glad for them to stick around, do whatever I can to keep them around. I need as many fans as I can at this point.	2325_12.a	2009-09-01	M	2325	Igor Andreev	Jesse Witten	Are they sticking around now?	2325_12.q	276.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2325_13	I don't want to waste my money. (laughter.) Just because I have some for once.	2325_13.a	2009-09-01	M	2325	Igor Andreev	Jesse Witten	You can get them another hotel room?	2325_13.q	276.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2325_14	It's expensive to play tennis. I lost -- I had a sponsor. I don't really have any sponsors this year. I was with -- I had a couple people from Naples where I'm from helping me with expenses. This year I've kind of been on my own. At the beginning of the year it was, Am I going to keep playing? Is it worth it? I was kind debating at the beginning of the year, and then I started winning a couple of tournaments and got going. Because I was coming back from injuries last year, as well last year. I was ranked about 500 at the beginning of the year, and then it was -- I wasn't sure it was worth it, especially on my own dime.	2325_14.a	2009-09-01	M	2325	Igor Andreev	Jesse Witten	Do you have any ideas what to do with it? That's a chunk of change.	2325_14.q	276.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2325_15	You always talk about it, but when you're hurt, I was at the futures, playing a 10-K future. I mean, you win the tournament, you get a thousand dollars or something like that. So I did win a few. I got my ranking -- got going again. I was playing well. I'm just fortunate to be where I am. I guess a couple of lucky breaks this year.	2325_15.a	2009-09-01	M	2325	Igor Andreev	Jesse Witten	How close did you come...	2325_15.q	276.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2325_16	We don't know. We'll see what that kinesiology does for me.	2325_16.a	2009-09-01	M	2325	Igor Andreev	Jesse Witten	What do you do if you don't play tennis?	2325_16.q	276.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2325_17	I try not to think about that. I don't know how close I want to be to doing that yet. We'll try to milk this as long as I can, the 30 grand.	2325_17.a	2009-09-01	M	2325	Igor Andreev	Jesse Witten	Seriously, do you have a backup plan?	2325_17.q	276.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2325_18	Um, there were good -- after the first year I got to the finals, NCAA's my first year, and they were kind of strong on that one. You get older, and they kind of tend to weaken the deal to go play. Actually, they offered me a coach and offered me some help and expenses to play and travel, but I just -- I loved college too much. I just -- I didn't want to let the team down. Just had too much fun, and I was playing well, and I wanted to finish out and get my degree because you never know what's going to happen with tennis. One ankle injury, you're done.	2325_18.a	2009-09-01	M	2325	Igor Andreev	Jesse Witten	A lot of guys go to college and stop after a year or two years. You stayed four; got your degree. Was there ever a point in your time there where you thought about leaving?	2325_18.q	276.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2325_19	No, well just the USTA, majors, whoever. Doesn't really matter who, but there were some offers, and I didn't -- I wasn't ready. Just wasn't ready to travel by myself for that long every week, different city. Just wasn't ready.	2325_19.a	2009-09-01	M	2325	Igor Andreev	Jesse Witten	When you say that, you're talking about like an agency?	2325_19.q	276.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2325_20	No, I think if I got through that one I'll be all right. That was the seed. I got my first ATP win, so I can't go backwards.	2325_20.a	2009-09-01	M	2325	Igor Andreev	Jesse Witten	Any concern keeping the nerves in check? You have a day or two to think about this heading into the next round.	2325_20.q	276.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2325_21	Yeah, it's funny, everybody seemed to be my coach the last few days, but I hit with John McEnroe the other day, and he was really being helpful. He's on my team tennis team, as well. Plays five or six matches with us. We've gotten closer over the last five or six years. He was trying to give me pointers, helping me out. He usually doesn't say too much when it comes to somebody else's game or coaching like that. That meant a lot, just to know that he was -- and he called me after I qualified, you know. So I mean, just for them to take the time out of their busy schedule, which I know is busy, I mean, it means a lot to you. Makes you feel appreciated and what you're doing maybe is worth it. I take the little things out of it, I guess.	2325_21.a	2009-09-01	M	2325	Igor Andreev	Jesse Witten	Is there anybody you sought out advice from about Andreev in particular, playing him, what would work against him, what to watch out for?	2325_21.q	276.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
768_0	Definitely, yup.  It was very exciting.  Yeah, it was very fulfilling.  Yeah, it's a good steppingstone for me.	768_0.a	2007-01-15	F	768	nan	Monique Adamczak	Biggest moment of your career?	768_0.q	241.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
768_1	Yeah, I guess she tried to change her game up a few times in the match.  I did well to keep that under control. But I guess I got ahead of myself a little bit towards the end of the second set.  To her credit, she also kept fighting.  Yeah, but I stayed tough (smiling).	768_1.a	2007-01-15	F	768	nan	Monique Adamczak	You looked to dominate pretty much all the match; perhaps tightened up in the last few games.  Was it just she started to get into it?	768_1.q	241.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
768_2	She's playing Jess Moore at the moment.	768_2.a	2007-01-15	F	768	nan	Monique Adamczak	Likely to get Kuznetsova next.	768_2.q	241.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
768_3	Yeah, then I look forward to that.  I played Kuznetsova as a junior actually, when I was about 17, at a tournament before the Australian Open.	768_3.a	2007-01-15	F	768	nan	Monique Adamczak	Well, if that happens?	768_3.q	241.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
768_4	Went to three sets.  That was a long time ago.  Times have changed.  We'll see what happens.  It will be exciting.	768_4.a	2007-01-15	F	768	nan	Monique Adamczak	How did you go?	768_4.q	241.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
768_5	What I've been working on the last few weeks with my coach here, Peter McGraw, is just staying mentally tough, staying calm out there.  We've been working on a few technical things, of course, which I've improved a lot. Yeah, it's mainly mental.  I've always had -- I think I've always had a good game.  Just getting it together mentally and really believing that I can win those matches and I belong at this level, so...	768_5.a	2007-01-15	F	768	nan	Monique Adamczak	What were your strengths today?	768_5.q	241.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
768_6	It's practice, day in, day out.  On the practice court, a hundred percent.  Off the practice court, in the gym.  It's pushing yourself.  Yeah, it's having a sense of confidence, a sense of belief.	768_6.a	2007-01-15	F	768	nan	Monique Adamczak	How do you gain mental strength?	768_6.q	241.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
768_7	I'm pretty calm actually.  I'm very excited.  I'm actually a lot calmer.  I thought I'd be like crazy.  No, I'm pretty relaxed (smiling). You know, I'm sure, like a lot of other young tennis players out there, I've dreamt this moment for a long time, you know, playing in my home country, doing well, winning matches. I've, yeah, dreamt it a lot.  So for it to happen, it's very fulfilling.	768_7.a	2007-01-15	F	768	nan	Monique Adamczak	You look like you can't wipe the smile off your face.  What's the feeling inside?	768_7.q	241.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
768_8	What's the next goal?  Well, it's wherever that may be.  You know, uhm, I came into this tournament -- honestly, I came into this tournament really wanting to make third round, fourth round.  That was my goal. I believe I can achieve that, I really do.  You don't think about it when you're out there.  But when you go out into the gym, you're working your ass off, that's what you're thinking about.  That's what I'm thinking about, so...	768_8.a	2007-01-15	F	768	nan	Monique Adamczak	You fulfilled that one.  Where is the next one?	768_8.q	241.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
768_9	No, no.	768_9.a	2007-01-15	F	768	nan	Monique Adamczak	So this win today is not your final?	768_9.q	241.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
768_10	No, not a chance.  I was lucky enough yesterday night.  Me and my coach went to watch Safin practice on Rod Laver Arena.  I never even actually walked on Rod Laver Arena before.  Never went down, the neon lights, walked down the steps.  It was a surreal moment.  I really felt like I could play there one day, yeah.  It was, yeah, a good feeling.	768_10.a	2007-01-15	F	768	nan	Monique Adamczak	A lot of young players, they celebrate an early win, forget they have to come out the next day.	768_10.q	241.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
768_11	I've had a lot of injuries actually.  It's just been overwork, overtraining, a bit unlucky.  I'm a hard worker.  The tendency was always to push myself too hard.  I think I've learnt to control that a bit, step back, just manage my body better. But, yeah, I've had a few injuries.  I've done well, then I'd be out with an injury for a couple months, and that would set me back. I think it's made me a lot tougher.  It's made me who I am today.  May have set me back a bit, but I think I wouldn't be here today if it hadn't been for that.	768_11.a	2007-01-15	F	768	nan	Monique Adamczak	Has there been any injury problems the last few years or has it just been playing ITFs?	768_11.q	241.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
2735_0	Well, just happy that I won today and that I got through. The crowd really helped me out today. It wasn't easy. I won 7-6 in the third, which is a great achievement.	2735_0.a	2010-08-27	F	2735	Elena Dementieva	Caroline Wozniacki	How did that one feel?	2735_0.q	2.0	1	Semifinals	PILOT PEN TENNIS AT YALE	Premier
2735_1	Yeah, well, I didn't really feel the ball too well in the beginning. She started hitting really well. I felt my back a little bit. Yeah, I mean, he just told me to keep moving my feet because I wasn't doing that, and that's why I didn't get too many balls in.	2735_1.a	2010-08-27	F	2735	Elena Dementieva	Caroline Wozniacki	Got off to a slow start. You called your coach out at the first changeover. Can you explain about what you talked about that early in the match.	2735_1.q	2.0	1	Semifinals	PILOT PEN TENNIS AT YALE	Premier
2735_2	Well, of course, I would love to have finished the match already back then. She started to serve, which gets on the line, and I didn't take it. Then afterwards I hit two short returns, which she just goes in and attacks on. Everything from then just turns around and she had a great start to the tiebreaker. I wasn't too pleased about that. Afterwards, I just told myself, Keep fighting. She still has to win four more points to win the match so you're still in there.	2735_2.a	2010-08-27	F	2735	Elena Dementieva	Caroline Wozniacki	You have a triple match point and she hit the ball into the net three times. She comes back, wins the game. What is going through your head?	2735_2.q	2.0	1	Semifinals	PILOT PEN TENNIS AT YALE	Premier
2735_3	Well, I felt it already against Cibulkova in that match where I also called the trainer. Today I felt it again. Today I took some Tylenol and that helped. I'm just going to get some treatment and hopefully that will be fine.	2735_3.a	2010-08-27	F	2735	Elena Dementieva	Caroline Wozniacki	Talk about the injury. Is that something that happened tonight or preexisting?	2735_3.q	2.0	1	Semifinals	PILOT PEN TENNIS AT YALE	Premier
2735_4	A little bit of massage, for sure, stretching. Yeah, get cooled down and try to see what's going on. But, you know, it's just feeling stiff. Hopefully that's not too bad.	2735_4.a	2010-08-27	F	2735	Elena Dementieva	Caroline Wozniacki	What is the treatment between now and tomorrow?	2735_4.q	2.0	1	Semifinals	PILOT PEN TENNIS AT YALE	Premier
2735_5	No, I don't, because pressure is when you're put in a spot and you don't really feel like you belong there. When you really believe that you belong there, that you can do the things you have to do, there's no pressure. You just go out there and play.	2735_5.a	2010-08-27	F	2735	Elena Dementieva	Caroline Wozniacki	Are you feeling any pressure from being No.1 in the Open?	2735_5.q	2.0	1	Semifinals	PILOT PEN TENNIS AT YALE	Premier
2735_6	Well, it's a great tournament. You know, obviously I'm playing well here. I'm just really happy to be in the finals again for the third time in a row. Hopefully I can win the last match here tomorrow.	2735_6.a	2010-08-27	F	2735	Elena Dementieva	Caroline Wozniacki	Talk a little bit about your unbeaten streak here. Is it just something about this court?	2735_6.q	2.0	1	Semifinals	PILOT PEN TENNIS AT YALE	Premier
2735_7	Actually, I didn't think about that. I thought I was there all the time. You know, I just felt like, Okay, I need to get deeper returns. Yeah, I knew that, Okay, it's the last chance now at 5-4 for her when she was serving. I just went out there and I said, Okay, it's all or nothing.	2735_7.a	2010-08-27	F	2735	Elena Dementieva	Caroline Wozniacki	Breaking each other back and forth at the end of that second set. As you're holding, do you feel them ticking away, you have to get that break?	2735_7.q	2.0	1	Semifinals	PILOT PEN TENNIS AT YALE	Premier
2735_8	I don't know. I haven't been there yet so I can't answer that question yet. But when you go out on court, it really doesn't matter if you're seeded 1 or 10. You still have to win your matches. Unfortunately, you don't get straight to the finals and play that. You know, I just go out there, enjoy myself. Feel like I'm playing good tennis. I've showed that the last couple of weeks. You know, hopefully I can just continue at the Open.	2735_8.a	2010-08-27	F	2735	Elena Dementieva	Caroline Wozniacki	Being ranked No.1 at the US Open, does it feel any different, notice any difference the way you're treated?	2735_8.q	2.0	1	Semifinals	PILOT PEN TENNIS AT YALE	Premier
2735_9	Uhm, yeah, tomorrow's a new match. We start 0-0. We have to see. I don't have too much rest before the finals tomorrow. I'm just going to go over and have a massage, cool down, try to sleep as soon as possible, try to rest as much as I can before the match.	2735_9.a	2010-08-27	F	2735	Elena Dementieva	Caroline Wozniacki	What do you do now looking ahead to the final against Nadia? Do you put to one side the three results that you've had in the past with her?	2735_9.q	2.0	1	Semifinals	PILOT PEN TENNIS AT YALE	Premier
2735_10	No, I feel fine. I feel okay. I feel good. You know, I'm just happy that it's going well. It's a positive problem to have, that you're winning so much. You know, I wish I could have that all year.	2735_10.a	2010-08-27	F	2735	Elena Dementieva	Caroline Wozniacki	You came into the US Open last year after this tournament, so you played some matches. Now you had Montral, bit of a difficult week. Do you feel tired at all?	2735_10.q	2.0	1	Semifinals	PILOT PEN TENNIS AT YALE	Premier
4115_0	Yeah, you pretty much said it. Yeah, it was quite close set. I had some chances in the tiebreak. You know, if I would be able to make it, you know, try to push him for the third set, then maybe get another chances. But this would be just if. It didn't happened. Yeah, it wasn't one of my best matches with him, as well.	4115_0.a	2012-11-09	M	4115	Novak Djokovic	Tomas Berdych	Obviously you had your chances there in the second set. What was your assessment of the match?	4115_0.q	6.0	0	Round Robin	BARCLAYS ATP WORLD TOUR FINALS	Masters Cup
4115_1	Well, yeah, I think I play quite good three matches. Yeah, everyone has something, you know, something special. Yeah, this year was not the one that I was able to get from the group. You know, next week, it's another week, another event, another big thing. So I will try to get ready for that again.	4115_1.a	2012-11-09	M	4115	Novak Djokovic	Tomas Berdych	How did you feel about your level overall in the tournament? How do you feel this is going to carry into the Davis Cup?	4115_1.q	6.0	0	Round Robin	BARCLAYS ATP WORLD TOUR FINALS	Masters Cup
4115_2	Then probably the Spanish doesn't know there are some rules that you cannot make the surface actually as fast as you want. That's the rule of the speed of the court. So the court is going to be in between of the rules.	4115_2.a	2012-11-09	M	4115	Novak Djokovic	Tomas Berdych	In Spain the people talk about the surface in the Davis Cup. How do you think the surface is important to the final?	4115_2.q	6.0	0	Round Robin	BARCLAYS ATP WORLD TOUR FINALS	Masters Cup
4115_3	It was good enough to beat me. That's it, you know. You cannot judge it by one match because every single one is different. As long as he's going to be in semifinal playing with whoever opponent, then it could go even much better, much worse, even the same level. Every match is different.	4115_3.a	2012-11-09	M	4115	Novak Djokovic	Tomas Berdych	How would you rate overall Novak's performance today? Do you think he has a game that's good enough to win the tournament?	4115_3.q	6.0	0	Round Robin	BARCLAYS ATP WORLD TOUR FINALS	Masters Cup
4115_4	Well, it doesn't matter at all. I mean, it's just another big event coming up for the end of the year. You know, I'm getting even, you know, more tired, and that's it. You know, I'm just going to try to prepare myself as possible as I can for that event, and that's it. You know, I mean, well, it's hard to say if it's better to play with some lowerranked players and keep on winning, and then you going to come up for the match like that, and then you going to see completely different guys from different levels. I think this is the better option, to play with the tough guys. Even if you win or not, I think it's better to have a week like this than play some small tournament.	4115_4.a	2012-11-09	M	4115	Novak Djokovic	Tomas Berdych	For the Davis Cup, is it helpful to have these tough matches and tough opponents even if you lose, or is it hard to go into a big tournament when maybe your confidence isn't as high as it would be if you had been winning?	4115_4.q	6.0	0	Round Robin	BARCLAYS ATP WORLD TOUR FINALS	Masters Cup
4115_5	I would be very short. I hope that the best moment is still to come (smiling).	4115_5.a	2012-11-09	M	4115	Novak Djokovic	Tomas Berdych	It's never nice to ask questions to someone who has just lost, because it's embarrassing for everyone. Can you tell us what has been the best moments of this year? This is the end of the year. When have you been more satisfied and proud about yourself?	4115_5.q	6.0	0	Round Robin	BARCLAYS ATP WORLD TOUR FINALS	Masters Cup
2112_0	Last year the court was slow and he played better than I did. Today we both didn't play our best tennis. It was very tight. I could have lost. I had three or four breakpoints at 3-2, and I had many opportunities after that, but it was not easy. I believe I was able to play my service games better, and I was able to stick to the score. In the tiebreaker, he handed it to me. I served better in the third set. Before that, I didn't have any rhythm with my serve.	2112_0.a	2009-04-13	M	2112	nan	Marc Gicquel	He beat you easily last year in a challenger. What was different this time?	2112_0.q	48.0	1	1st Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
2112_1	Playing in these tournaments is what we all want. We're all happy to be here. If I don't try my best in these tournaments, then...	2112_1.a	2009-04-13	M	2112	nan	Marc Gicquel	How do you keep your motivation? You are 32 years old.	2112_1.q	48.0	1	1st Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
2112_2	I do fight. I don't want to lose. Today was a great fight. But I believe I didn't play well.	2112_2.a	2009-04-13	M	2112	nan	Marc Gicquel	I'll rephrase my question. Where do you find the physical strength to keep fighting that way?	2112_2.q	48.0	1	1st Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
2112_3	Well, I'm very happy that I won, but my tennis could have been better. From now on I can only do better. But I was tense that match.	2112_3.a	2009-04-13	M	2112	nan	Marc Gicquel	Some players say it's better to win when they don't play well.	2112_3.q	48.0	1	1st Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
2112_4	He's a friend from my childhood. He knows a little bit about tennis. But he's not my coach. I try to analyze my game by comparing what I was doing before. I know physically I'm not at my best level. I'm not fast enough. My physical fitness is the basis of my game. If I'm not fit, my forehand is not good enough and I'm not able to finish the points. I need to work on my speed, my endurance.	2112_4.a	2009-04-13	M	2112	nan	Marc Gicquel	You have no coach? Someone was there.	2112_4.q	48.0	1	1st Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
2112_5	You can write that down if you want. His name is Sebastien Lelivre. He's from Brittany. He's a friend from my childhood. He was once ranked 15 in the third series of players nationally. It is just that it's not easy to travel alone. Sometimes my wife is with me. But it's nice having him.	2112_5.a	2009-04-13	M	2112	nan	Marc Gicquel	Can we say your friend is your coach?	2112_5.q	48.0	1	1st Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
2112_6	I had a pretty good start. I played well in Casablanca and I made the first round here. I'm going to play in Barcelona, and I'll try to improve my game to be fit for the French Open.	2112_6.a	2009-04-13	M	2112	nan	Marc Gicquel	How did you start this season?	2112_6.q	48.0	1	1st Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
2112_7	I'm not sure. I am registered for playing the quallies, but I'm not sure I'm going to play them. I'll make a decision just before the tournament.	2112_7.a	2009-04-13	M	2112	nan	Marc Gicquel	Are you going to Rome?	2112_7.q	48.0	1	1st Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
117_0	Yeah, a lot's different. I just feel like the main thing is I'm doing it a little more consistent, playing good match after another one, battling through tough situations, and not letting them be too much and take me out of my rhythm.	117_0.a	2015-03-15	M	117	Jeremy Chardy	Donald Young	You looked really good. Anything different this year?	117_0.q	47.0	1	2nd Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
117_1	It's a big win for me. Every win at this level is a big win. I don't think he played his best. I thought I competed well. You're not able to play great every day, so I'm glad I was able to play well enough to win today.	117_1.a	2015-03-15	M	117	Jeremy Chardy	Donald Young	This was a really big win for you. Jeremy Chardy is a seeded player. He didn't seem to serve very well today, but what did you do to not get distracted from your game?	117_1.q	47.0	1	2nd Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
117_2	Yeah, I like it. The weather is great. The way the ball flies through the air and comes off the court. Topspin, it takes well on this court and makes my serve a little normal. All those things combined. Puts you in good atmosphere.	117_2.a	2015-03-15	M	117	Jeremy Chardy	Donald Young	Couple years ago you beat Andy Murray here early. Is there something special for you about playing here?	117_2.q	47.0	1	2nd Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
117_3	Yeah, seems like it's flying a tad more than normal. It's hard to control. I don't know, if it goes over a certain height the ball is just going out. But other than that, it's playing like normal. But the court might be a little slower, as well.	117_3.a	2015-03-15	M	117	Jeremy Chardy	Donald Young	Some of the players earlier this week were talking about maybe they know the conditions, the ball flies, but the courts are slow. Seems like some players this year are struggling to adjust to it this year. Have you noticed anything with the conditions?	117_3.q	47.0	1	2nd Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
117_4	Yeah, any time you can break someone late in the set is pretty big. I was able to do it from Love30. He missed a few shots and I made a couple shots I don't think he expected me to make. Went fast after that. I was excited for him to miss a couple of balls.	117_4.a	2015-03-15	M	117	Jeremy Chardy	Donald Young	At break point in the second set where you were able to come back from Love30 to get up 42, really kind of seemed like the breaking point in that set for him. Talk about, you know, how you felt like that kind of turned the match in your favor.	117_4.q	47.0	1	2nd Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
117_5	No, I have played there a few times before, but the first time this year, yeah.	117_5.a	2015-03-15	M	117	Jeremy Chardy	Donald Young	Is this your first match on Court 1 here, or have you played there before?	117_5.q	47.0	1	2nd Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
117_6	It's great. Coming from last week in Scotland where the crowd was 100% against me, to have them cheering for me felt pretty good. It's like another person on your side that's helping you out when you get down. It's another person on the other guy's back, as well, because they kind of stay on you.	117_6.a	2015-03-15	M	117	Jeremy Chardy	Donald Young	What was it like have a little bit of fan support there playing the first match of the day? Seemed like the crowd was really behind you.	117_6.q	47.0	1	2nd Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
117_7	Hopefully so. That's one thing at the top of my list is win a title. Hopefully this is the year I can get my first title and will play more consistently week in and week out.	117_7.a	2015-03-15	M	117	Jeremy Chardy	Donald Young	You had some good results in Delray Beach and Memphis. Is this the year for you to break through and win some titles?	117_7.q	47.0	1	2nd Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
117_8	Yeah, for sure. Rafa or Igor. I haven't Rafa before, but I have beaten Igor. Going to be a tough match whoever I play. If I play Rafa I'm not going to be the guy favored to win so I can swing free. I don't have any points to defend, so it's just free swinging from here out for me.	117_8.a	2015-03-15	M	117	Jeremy Chardy	Donald Young	Can you talk about the next round? Pretty good opportunity.	117_8.q	47.0	1	2nd Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
117_9	Yeah, I actually played Rafa here before in the third round in 2008, so it won't be the first time here. I'm playing well. I think it's the best tennis I have been playing in my career on a consistent basis. I'm excited to be in these positions and go out there and give my best and see what happens.	117_9.a	2015-03-15	M	117	Jeremy Chardy	Donald Young	With the Murray match a couple years ago, is there something from that you can draw on when you play a big match against Rafa here at this tournament?	117_9.q	47.0	1	2nd Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
117_10	It was pretty exciting. He beat me pretty good, but it was fun to be out there. I was 18, so it was really exciting. I was a very, very young kid, for sure.	117_10.a	2015-03-15	M	117	Jeremy Chardy	Donald Young	What do you remember from that 2008 match against Rafa?	117_10.q	47.0	1	2nd Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
117_11	Yeah, she has a great serve. The speed is comparable to the guys. She works harder than some of the guys on a regular basis. She has a great rhythm. You know, great timing. Great ball toss. She can hit the different spots. Spins off the top. It's really hard to read, so that makes it a great serve. Especially against the women who maybe don't have the biggest serves she has one. It's a huge weapon for her.	117_11.a	2015-03-15	M	117	Jeremy Chardy	Donald Young	You're a student of the game. Serena Williams' serve. What do you notice about it that's so impressive even among men? People seem to be really impressed by it.	117_11.q	47.0	1	2nd Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
5399_0	I did. I love playing at Wimbledon. It's my favorite tournament. Centre Court here at Wimbledon is something so special to play on. I just enjoyed it.	5399_0.a	2013-06-29	F	5399	Samantha Stosur	Sabine Lisicki	It says in the notes how much you enjoy smiling. You clearly enjoyed that game.	5399_0.q	24.0	1	3rd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
5399_1	Yes, I am.	5399_1.a	2013-06-29	F	5399	Samantha Stosur	Sabine Lisicki	You've obviously had a couple of difficult years with injuries, illnesses. Are you fully fit, raring to go now?	5399_1.q	24.0	1	3rd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
5399_2	Definitely. Especially having a tough draw. First three rounds were, all of them were tough players to play on. It gives you a lot of confidence to beat them.	5399_2.a	2013-06-29	F	5399	Samantha Stosur	Sabine Lisicki	Which would be a good feeling for you?	5399_2.q	24.0	1	3rd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
5399_3	Definitely, yes.	5399_3.a	2013-06-29	F	5399	Samantha Stosur	Sabine Lisicki	Presumably gives you a lot of confidence to feel so good physically?	5399_3.q	24.0	1	3rd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
5399_4	Every time coming back from an injury I got better and also stronger mentally. It made me enjoy the game even more, because I know how quickly everything can be taken away from you. So I just enjoy every second being out there.	5399_4.a	2013-06-29	F	5399	Samantha Stosur	Sabine Lisicki	What has it been like going through the different injuries?	5399_4.q	24.0	1	3rd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
5399_5	Yes, definitely. It gives you confidence in the match, during the match. You know, the fun factor is important for me, as well.	5399_5.a	2013-06-29	F	5399	Samantha Stosur	Sabine Lisicki	Do you think that now is a key thing in your mind to take you forward?	5399_5.q	24.0	1	3rd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
5399_6	Well, you have to play your best to beat her, that's for sure. But, you know, everybody's human being. You know, when I play, we'll see what happens, yeah.	5399_6.a	2013-06-29	F	5399	Samantha Stosur	Sabine Lisicki	Next up could well be Serena. A couple weeks ago we were talking about her, you were saying on your day you can serve as hard as her, she's not unbeatable. What do you say today?	5399_6.q	24.0	1	3rd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
5399_7	I don't know what the stats say. Is it like that?	5399_7.a	2013-06-29	F	5399	Samantha Stosur	Sabine Lisicki	You feel you're serving as hard as she does, even here?	5399_7.q	24.0	1	3rd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
5399_8	Sam played a fantastic match, so she gave me a great challenge. I think going through that challenge makes me be ready for the next one, as well. There are always things to improve, but I feel great out there.	5399_8.a	2013-06-29	F	5399	Samantha Stosur	Sabine Lisicki	I don't know. Were you close to your best already today?	5399_8.q	24.0	1	3rd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
5399_9	I'll let that to my coaches. I'll do my regular cooldown stuff and focus on my own thing.	5399_9.a	2013-06-29	F	5399	Samantha Stosur	Sabine Lisicki	Will you watch the match that's later today between the two women?	5399_9.q	24.0	1	3rd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
5399_10	To serve well, definitely. Well, the return obviously, too. Try to break her, which will be tough. You know, I think that's the two keys, yeah.	5399_10.a	2013-06-29	F	5399	Samantha Stosur	Sabine Lisicki	If you do face Williams, what do you think would be the key to that match?	5399_10.q	24.0	1	3rd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
5399_11	What is dangerous?	5399_11.a	2013-06-29	F	5399	Samantha Stosur	Sabine Lisicki	Everybody is describing here as the nailedon favorite. Do you think that's a little bit dangerous?	5399_11.q	24.0	1	3rd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
5399_12	I don't know. I was in that situation last year when everybody was saying that Sharapova was the favorite. I'm probably going into that match being the underdog, but I like that.	5399_12.a	2013-06-29	F	5399	Samantha Stosur	Sabine Lisicki	The fact that everybody seems to have written off almost everybody else and almost called her the winner already.	5399_12.q	24.0	1	3rd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
5399_13	Have nothing to lose.	5399_13.a	2013-06-29	F	5399	Samantha Stosur	Sabine Lisicki	Why do you like that?	5399_13.q	24.0	1	3rd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
5399_14	No. But, you know, I enjoy playing at Wimbledon. I'm looking forward to that match. It's fun to be here in the second week for the fourth time in a row.	5399_14.a	2013-06-29	F	5399	Samantha Stosur	Sabine Lisicki	That allows you to play a different way than if you're favored over someone?	5399_14.q	24.0	1	3rd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4105_0	Well, the score is easy. To actually play the match, it's never easy, you know, especially for me coming here only Saturday. You know, only hit once before the match. First time I actually hit on center court was today in the morning. That's why I came earlier, you know, to try to feel the court. I think it was a good performance. There are few things for me that I have to work on tomorrow to be better in my second round. But, you know, I take what I get. I cannot complain.	4105_0.a	2012-01-16	F	4105	Heather Watson	Victoria Azarenka	Your form is obviously good. Is it a bit difficult with a match like that when you perhaps could have used something a bit more testing?	4105_0.q	3.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4105_1	That's what was actually very positive note about it. There was nothing really serious for a long period of time. There were a few moments that I had to stop, you know, my body couldn't handle so many matches in a row. But because of the commitments to tournaments, you have to go play, you have to go on court. So sometimes you just have no other choice. But it was a good year. I feel I'm much stronger physically now. There is always a battle a little bit of doing a perfect schedule. It's tough. But I'm ready for 2012, you know, and try to actually learn from what I did last year and try to make it better this year.	4105_1.a	2012-01-16	F	4105	Heather Watson	Victoria Azarenka	You had sort of a strange 2011. In a way, it's been your best year, but also had a lot of injuries and some withdrawals. Any of these injuries concerning, longterm, or things that come up and can be fixed?	4105_1.q	3.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4105_2	Yeah, it is. But it's always kind of new beginning, new thing that you have to, you know, get the feeling of the competition, really get into the competition. So I'm trying to improve, you know, with the mental. I think there is no limit. I'm glad the way I am on the court now. I'm really enjoying myself.	4105_2.a	2012-01-16	F	4105	Heather Watson	Victoria Azarenka	The confidence from the year, the mental side of things, the way you played last year has obviously helped give you a lot of confidence, I imagine.	4105_2.q	3.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4105_3	I think she's a very good player. She probably maybe was a little bit overwhelming, you know, playing on center court. First match for her as well, and she's still young. But I think I also started a little bit rusty. I came back strong and kept my composure all the way through the end of the match. I really put a lot of pressure on her. So I don't think she really managed that well today, but I think she has a great skills. You know, she's very good mover. She has a good serve. Today was a little bit difficult for me, as well. It was difficult to serve with a little breeze of wind. But I think she has a good potential.	4105_3.a	2012-01-16	F	4105	Heather Watson	Victoria Azarenka	What did you think of your opponent today? She had one very good game, and then you rather dominated her. Did you think she looked like a decent prospect?	4105_3.q	3.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4105_4	Well, this is always the goals, you know. For me, I'm such a competitor that I always put challenges on myself on the court, off the court, and I try to reach them. I always go step by step. Cannot jump ahead. I think now is a good opportunity. I feel good playing. But I'm going to take it step by step all the way through.	4105_4.a	2012-01-16	F	4105	Heather Watson	Victoria Azarenka	Is 2012 a year where you think you should say to yourself, Now it's time to take the next step and consistently challenge for Grand Slam finals?	4105_4.q	3.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4105_5	You know, before you win matches, you're not going to have any ranking. The most important thing is to go deep in the tournaments, and then you have your ranking.	4105_5.a	2012-01-16	F	4105	Heather Watson	Victoria Azarenka	Is the No.1 ranking one of your goals as well?	4105_5.q	3.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4105_6	I'm not really approaching it that way. I'm approaching it day by day, because every day is different. Sometimes you feel great; sometimes you feel sleepy; sometimes you feel energetic like crazy. It's really more important on how well you take each moment and every details.	4105_6.a	2012-01-16	F	4105	Heather Watson	Victoria Azarenka	With your results last week and then the way you played this morning, do you think this is your best chance to finally crack a Grand Slam?	4105_6.q	3.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4105_7	I guess. I won a tournament and won today. So, yeah, the ball striking is pretty well. But that's not the whole magic to win matches.	4105_7.a	2012-01-16	F	4105	Heather Watson	Victoria Azarenka	You're striking the ball consistently well the last couple weeks. That must give you a lot of confidence.	4105_7.q	3.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4105_8	Actually, I didn't get my coffee in the morning today, so I was really pissed off (laughter). So tomorrow I'm definitely getting it. It was so early and I wanted to come play a little bit longer on center court. Everything was closed. I said, Oh, my God, I need my coffee. So I kept trying to open my eyes without it and it was not working (smiling).	4105_8.a	2012-01-16	F	4105	Heather Watson	Victoria Azarenka	How did you feel today? Sleepy? Awake? Energetic?	4105_8.q	3.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3146_0	"I am really excited to be back. You know, I really miss playing tennis, obviously. I don't know if you guys know ""obviously,"" but I definitely miss it, and I'm thoroughly enjoying the short time that I've been back on the practice courts."	3146_0.a	2011-06-13	F	3146	nan	Serena Williams	How excited are you feeling to be back?	3146_0.q	11.0	0	1st Round	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	Premier
3146_1	Well, it sucked because I missed a lot of being -- you know, I left ranked No.1. That's what I miss most is just being on top of the game and just playing some really good tennis and the challenges of all the players.	3146_1.a	2011-06-13	F	3146	nan	Serena Williams	What did you miss the most?	3146_1.q	11.0	0	1st Round	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	Premier
3146_2	I don't know. I haven't played a match yet, so I'm not quite sure how I feel condition-wise. I feel good on the practice court. But I always think that when you get in a match it is totally different, so I kind of have to see.	3146_2.a	2011-06-13	F	3146	nan	Serena Williams	How would you describe your condition at the moment?	3146_2.q	11.0	0	1st Round	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	Premier
3146_3	Well, I have been hitting for a while. I have been seriously hitting for like a month, you know. But I kind of started hitting a little before that; not every day, but every day I have been going at it for a little bit.	3146_3.a	2011-06-13	F	3146	nan	Serena Williams	How long have you been practicing? How long have you been just practicing?	3146_3.q	11.0	0	1st Round	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	Premier
3146_4	Well, I wanted to play Roland Garros, but it didn't quite work out, and I figured maybe I can try to play another event. And I don't usually play warmup tournaments before Wimbledon. I also figured I haven't played in about a year, so maybe I can -- it's probably smart for me to play a warmup tournament, and where better to play than Eastbourne? I have played here before, and I have had some halfway decent results here.	3146_4.a	2011-06-13	F	3146	nan	Serena Williams	What made you want to come back and play here?	3146_4.q	11.0	0	1st Round	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	Premier
3146_5	Wow. You know, I'm just here to do the best I can and I'm here not to lose. So that's about it.	3146_5.a	2011-06-13	F	3146	nan	Serena Williams	Venus says she's here to win it and to win Wimbledon. Do you share those feelings?	3146_5.q	11.0	0	1st Round	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	Premier
3146_6	Well, I mean, Wimbledon was great. I was playing great, I was serving amazing, and, you know, overall my confidence was right up there. It was almost even a shock, because I didn't expect to play so well, and everyone was like, Oh, she's playing so well. I honestly thought I could do better. I remember after the tournament was over, I was talking to my dad about things that I wanted to work on and things I wanted to improve on. That's about it. So hopefully I've been able to improve on those things that I wanted to.	3146_6.a	2011-06-13	F	3146	nan	Serena Williams	Could you take us back to Wimbledon last year and just your feelings, how delighted you were, and then just talk us through sort of the next couple of weeks after that.	3146_6.q	11.0	0	1st Round	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	Premier
3146_7	I don't know. I definitely expect to get there. I don't know when. I'm hoping tomorrow. I'm also hoping, you know, I can peak at Wimbledon. I can peak hopefully in the second week, and hopefully I'll get there. So, you know, I'm just taking everything one day at a time, and I'm not putting too much expectations on myself or on my game. Most of all I'm just happy to be in competition.	3146_7.a	2011-06-13	F	3146	nan	Serena Williams	Would it be expecting too much for you to hit those spots again so soon after your injury?	3146_7.q	11.0	0	1st Round	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	Premier
3146_8	Definitely. I feel like we've been on a similar road together. Her road hasn't been as arduous or as long as mine, but I know what she's been through coming back from Australia. She never retires, and she had to retire. So, you know, we kind of -- I actually felt like, you know, when you're down and someone's down with you, it kind of makes you feel a little bit better. (Smiling.) That's kind of how I felt. I was like, Yeah. Ha ha. But we've been really enjoying our time just getting back together and practicing next to her and looking over and seeing her play so well. I'm like, Okay, I've got to do better.	3146_8.a	2011-06-13	F	3146	nan	Serena Williams	Does it help you that Venus is making the same sort of comeback as well?	3146_8.q	11.0	0	1st Round	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	Premier
3146_9	I don't hit with her too much in practice; maybe just a few times literally. Two, three times maximum, not much at all.	3146_9.a	2011-06-13	F	3146	nan	Serena Williams	Were you hitting against her in practice?	3146_9.q	11.0	0	1st Round	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	Premier
3146_10	You know, I don't know why we don't hit with each other. We both have our own hitting partners and we hit with our own people. We don't really hit each other. She's so good. When she hits with me, I just get really frustrated. It's like she's always killing me on the practice courts.	3146_10.a	2011-06-13	F	3146	nan	Serena Williams	Is that because you get too competitive when you play each other?	3146_10.q	11.0	0	1st Round	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	Premier
3146_11	It's nothing like it?	3146_11.a	2011-06-13	F	3146	nan	Serena Williams	Presumably this is nothing like when you came back after a long absence and won in Australia?	3146_11.q	11.0	0	1st Round	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	Premier
3146_12	This is totally different, because I've had some serious health problems and I was literally on my deathbed at one point in my career or my life. This is like a totally different road where I'm more or less thinking, okay, I have nothing to lose at this point. And I'm just excited, more than anything, to be playing. And injury-bearing, you know, that's great, but now it's just all about me being here and being just happy.	3146_12.a	2011-06-13	F	3146	nan	Serena Williams	Is it nothing like it, or is it a much tougher road you've come back on?	3146_12.q	11.0	0	1st Round	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	Premier
3146_13	Well, you're obviously talking about my lung, the pulmonary embolism?	3146_13.a	2011-06-13	F	3146	nan	Serena Williams	What did the doctors say to you in terms of how serious it was? What were their words when they sort of explained things to you?	3146_13.q	11.0	0	1st Round	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	Premier
3146_14	Well, they just said that I had several clots bilaterally, so in both lungs, and it wasn't -- a lot of people die from that because you don't recognize it. Me being an athlete, I couldn't breathe. I honestly just thought I was out of shape. So I thought I needed to get on the treadmill or something or hit the Elliptical. You know, they just said it could have gotten a lot serious a day later or two days later. It could have been really not good. It could have possibly been career-ending, but for the grace of God I got there in time and I was able to recover from it.	3146_14.a	2011-06-13	F	3146	nan	Serena Williams	Yeah.	3146_14.q	11.0	0	1st Round	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	Premier
3146_15	"Yeah, I always use the word ""blessed ."" I had great people around me. My physio forced me to go to the hospital, whereas I was actually on the way to a party, to be quite honest. She's like, No, you need to go to the hospital. Glad I didn't go to that party."	3146_15.a	2011-06-13	F	3146	nan	Serena Williams	So they told you you were in fact quite lucky then in some respects?	3146_15.q	11.0	0	1st Round	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	Premier
3146_16	Absolutely. This is totally different from, you know, any other comeback, because this has given me a whole new perspective on my career and not taking things for granted. Not that I've ever taken things for granted before, but there were times when I'm like, Oh, another match, and I'm really, you know, like, This is so hard. But now it's more like, Yes, I'm out here and I could have had a chance where I could never be out here again. And especially being at the top of your game, having to have something like that happen randomly was -- it's tough, and it really makes me appreciate things. Again, not that I didn't appreciate it before, because you guys know more than anything I love winning, and so it's just a different perspective.	3146_16.a	2011-06-13	F	3146	nan	Serena Williams	Has what happened to you given you a new perspective at all on your career?	3146_16.q	11.0	0	1st Round	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	Premier
3146_17	No, I'm definitely going to still get really serious about line calls. (Laughter.) I probably won't make the same threats. (Laughter.) But I pretty much learned that lesson. My attitude hasn't changed. I still cracked a couple of racquets in practice. But that's good. That just still makes me feel like I have that desire, and, you know, I have that, you know, insatiable, you know, just innate thing inside me that I just want everything and I just want to win and I want to do well.	3146_17.a	2011-06-13	F	3146	nan	Serena Williams	When you go through something so serious -- welcome back, by the way -- do you think you'll ever again find it easier to get worked up about a line call or a serve that doesn't go where you want it to go? Are there aspects of your game that you won't be able to take so seriously again?	3146_17.q	11.0	0	1st Round	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	Premier
3146_18	It was definitely linked. I had to have two surgeries and so close to each other, and, you know, just -- I was in a cast for 20 weeks, which I was debating whether I'd rather be in jail for 20 weeks or a cast, and I was leaning towards jail because I really hated that cast. That was really tough. Mentally that was one of the toughest things for me. But, you know, having your foot in one position for so long and not moving it and not being able to walk and not being able to do a lot of things, you know, didn't give my particular -- my history of my blood moving and stuff, so it caused a lot of problems.	3146_18.a	2011-06-13	F	3146	nan	Serena Williams	How sure are you that these most recent health problems were linked to what happened in Germany?	3146_18.q	11.0	0	1st Round	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	Premier
3146_19	With my foot?	3146_19.a	2011-06-13	F	3146	nan	Serena Williams	What actually happened, then, if you could tell us about that evening? Do you remember what actually happened?	3146_19.q	11.0	0	1st Round	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	Premier
3146_20	Honestly I don't know. To this day I don't know. I was at this restaurant/barry kind of restaurant thing, and I was with my nephew at the time and my hitting partner. We were literally leaving and I was walking, and then I felt something. I was like, Uh, guys, be careful. I think there's glass on the floor. I just stepped back and I was like, Oh, that really hurts. So then, you know, I'm just thinking, okay, I'm tough. I'm just gonna keep walking. I took another step. And I was like, Oh, my God. There's definitely glass on the floor. Please be careful. And so then my coach, he took his phone, he looked down and there's like this massive puddle of blood. I was like, Oh, my gosh. So, you know, they rushed me back -- I ended up fainting because I lost so much blood because I was standing up. I ended up having to get stitches in both feet. One was on top and one was on the bottom of my other foot. I guess it sliced right through my ligament. Now, I didn't know at the time that my ligament was torn. I just know that my toe was hanging low, and I didn't -- you know, I just thought, okay, they said it was because of swelling. They said, Oh, it's swelling, blah, blah, blah. So I thought, okay, I'll be fine, you know, whatever. Eventually obviously it wasn't fine. But to this day I don't know. I was just walking and leaving and I just felt like, you know, something like -- it felt weird.	3146_20.a	2011-06-13	F	3146	nan	Serena Williams	With the bottle.	3146_20.q	11.0	0	1st Round	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	Premier
3146_21	Yeah, and I started to wear boots. You ever see that movie Sliding Doors with Gwyneth Paltrow? I was this close to wearing boots, and I got a pedicure and I thought, man, I don't want to mess up my toes. Go figure.	3146_21.a	2011-06-13	F	3146	nan	Serena Williams	Were you barefoot or have sandals on?	3146_21.q	11.0	0	1st Round	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	Premier
3146_22	Well, it was tough. My first surgery was different, because my first surgery I was in LA, and I kind of stayed there and I kind of was hanging out or whatever. You know, I can't do too much with one leg. And the second surgery was way tough, especially mentally, because I thought, okay, there goes Australia, which is really, you know, one of my favorite -- obviously one of my favorite tournaments to play. That one was more mentally tough than a lot of things that I've been through in my life outside of maybe my sister's passing. So that was incredibly hard for me. I think I may have been a little depressed at some moments. Then everything just happened from there, just the lung issues and it really was a disaster, to be honest. What did I do? You know, I hung out a lot. I went to a lot of Dolphins games, and then I went to a bunch of Miami Heat games. Then that's about it.	3146_22.a	2011-06-13	F	3146	nan	Serena Williams	What did you do with yourself when you couldn't play? I mean, how did you occupy your time?	3146_22.q	11.0	0	1st Round	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	Premier
3146_23	I definitely watched the US. I was on my way to recovery back then. I was out of my cast. Venus got to the semis there, so I was there a lot. I watched a little of the Aussie Open but not too much because I was busy, I guess, doing my own thing.	3146_23.a	2011-06-13	F	3146	nan	Serena Williams	Are you much of a spectator of tennis? Could you bring yourself to watch the US Open, the Australian, and the French?	3146_23.q	11.0	0	1st Round	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	Premier
3146_24	I'm not thinking that far ahead. I'm just taking it one day at a time and just one day at a time. I mean, I'm not preparing for today or Wimbledon. I'm preparing for, you know, the rest of my career.	3146_24.a	2011-06-13	F	3146	nan	Serena Williams	If, after all you have been through, in three weeks' time you were to retain your Wimbledon title, where would that rank in terms of achievement in your career?	3146_24.q	11.0	0	1st Round	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	Premier
3146_25	There were a few days I didn't get out of bed. I was just -- I was actually on the couch. I laid on the couch for a couple of days, because after everything, I ended up having to have -- just so much stuff happened to me and I just couldn't understand why. It was like, okay. I kept trying to figure out what I could do different or what I -- not necessarily what I did wrong; just what didn't I do or what did I do to deserve this? I don't think that had anything to do with it. I just think it was a series of unfortunate events. As the Bible says, there are unforeseen occurrences and unforeseen things that can just take place.	3146_25.a	2011-06-13	F	3146	nan	Serena Williams	Has the emotion of everything you've been through, obviously the illness and the emergency surgery, has the emotion of that caught up where you thought, whoa? Has it come out in tears or any other ways?	3146_25.q	11.0	0	1st Round	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	Premier
3146_26	Well, I hope so, because we've missed tennis so much. If tennis has missed us half as much as we have missed tennis, we're in a good place.	3146_26.a	2011-06-13	F	3146	nan	Serena Williams	Do you think tennis has missed you and your sister as much as you've missed tennis?	3146_26.q	11.0	0	1st Round	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	Premier
2119_0	Oh, I don't know. Maybe yes. I think I start a little bit cold and not the same like I was starting outside. But I don't know if is because of the conditions, no? But also the day, you know, I been yesterday all day without do anything, like without playing all day. So maybe it was also that.	2119_0.a	2009-08-29	M	2119	Igor Andreev	Fernando Verdasco	You got broken in the first game of the match. Was it a slow start because of the different conditions?	2119_0.q	10.0	1	Semifinals	PILOT PEN TENNIS PRESENTED BY SCHICK	ATP250
2119_1	Yeah, of course. For me, I think it's important to finish in two sets, better than three, to try to be more rest for tonight for the final. So I am happy for that.	2119_1.a	2009-08-29	M	2119	Igor Andreev	Fernando Verdasco	Two tough tiebreak sets in the match. Are you glad you were able to finish it in two sets before the final tonight?	2119_1.q	10.0	1	Semifinals	PILOT PEN TENNIS PRESENTED BY SCHICK	ATP250
2119_2	I will go now to eat something and rest few hours and then warm up just before the final again.	2119_2.a	2009-08-29	M	2119	Igor Andreev	Fernando Verdasco	What will you do now, between now and the final?	2119_2.q	10.0	1	Semifinals	PILOT PEN TENNIS PRESENTED BY SCHICK	ATP250
2119_3	I know that he's playing so good tennis. He have been playing all the summer so good. He won the US Open Series. So I think I will need to play so good to beat him. But I'm feeling good and I will try just to keep doing my game. I think if I play good, I will have my chances.	2119_3.a	2009-08-29	M	2119	Igor Andreev	Fernando Verdasco	And you're playing Sam in the final. What are your expectations?	2119_3.q	10.0	1	Semifinals	PILOT PEN TENNIS PRESENTED BY SCHICK	ATP250
2399_0	You always expect your opponents to play well, especially at this stage of the tournament. And he served great. Served really, really well in the tiebreaks. I think he maybe missed two first serves. The second one wasn't until 6-4 in the tiebreak. He was serving really well at the start. And I had a few chances, you know, in the first tiebreak. I had chances early in the third set. I didn't take them.	2399_0.a	2009-07-03	M	2399	Andy Roddick	Andy Murray	You seem to have run into the Roddick of 2003. Were you expecting that?	2399_0.q	3.0	0	Semifinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
2399_1	I thought I played well. I mean, you know, if you look at the stats, I hit more winners, less unforced errors, more aces. I'm sure the points that we won were very, very similar. It just came down to a few points here or there on his serve. And he served really, really well. You know, very close to the lines. Hitting at that pace, at such a high percentage, I think he was high 70s for a lot of the match. You know, sometimes there's not a whole lot you can do with that. But definitely didn't play a bad match.	2399_1.a	2009-07-03	M	2399	Andy Roddick	Andy Murray	How do you rate your own performance?	2399_1.q	3.0	0	Semifinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
2399_2	I mean, I don't think I played that passive. I think I hit a lot of winners. You know, my game style against him is not always to sort of go on the court and try and blast winners, you know, all the time. Because he has such a big serve that you need to try and, you know, get into points and make returns. I used my slice well. I didn't passes as well as I normally do. But he came up with some good volleys and big serves, and that is what happened. Like I say, it wasn't through being too passive or me playing a poor match.	2399_2.a	2009-07-03	M	2399	Andy Roddick	Andy Murray	Do you think you were playing too passive or he was playing too great?	2399_2.q	3.0	0	Semifinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
2399_3	No. I mean, he came up with some good volleys. You know, the one when I had the set point in the third set, well, he apologized. He completely miss-hit the volley. He was trying to hit it to the other side and it dropped very short and I couldn't get it. I mean, he makes volleys. He doesn't normally miss a lot. You just have to make the passes, and I didn't make as many as I needed to. But I wasn't surprised by anything that he did. I expected him to play very well.	2399_3.a	2009-07-03	M	2399	Andy Roddick	Andy Murray	Were you surprised with the sheer quality of his play at the net?	2399_3.q	3.0	0	Semifinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
2399_4	No, it had nothing to do with the outcome of the match. I think you're always going to be a little bit stiff and sore when you get to the end of these sort of tournaments. But it wasn't anything that sort of hampered my movement or anything.	2399_4.a	2009-07-03	M	2399	Andy Roddick	Andy Murray	Did you have a knee problem during the match?	2399_4.q	3.0	0	Semifinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
2399_5	His return of serve?	2399_5.a	2009-07-03	M	2399	Andy Roddick	Andy Murray	Could you talk about Andy's return? And secondly give us an assessment about the final. Does he have a good chance against Roger?	2399_5.q	3.0	0	Semifinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
2399_6	I mean, I think a lot of people think that necessarily he doesn't return that well. But he has a decent return. It's not the best and it's definitely not the worst. But, you know, he makes quite a lot. He doesn't miss that many returns on second serves. Because he serves so well, it makes it even more important for you to serve well. If you don't do that, then he's going to create chances. Because he came to the net a lot today. I think if he serves like that he's got a chance against anyone, 'cause it comes down to, like I say, a few points in each set. So regardless of whether it's Roger or, you know, me or anybody else, if he serves high 70s with the pace he's got on his serve, he's got a good chance.	2399_6.a	2009-07-03	M	2399	Andy Roddick	Andy Murray	Yes.	2399_6.q	3.0	0	Semifinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
2399_7	I had a pretty good record against him as well going into today. Like I say, if someone serves 130 miles an hour consistently throughout the match, and above, you know, in the high like 75s to 80%, it's very tough to break them, especially on a court like this that's quick.	2399_7.a	2009-07-03	M	2399	Andy Roddick	Andy Murray	Despite his record against Roger?	2399_7.q	3.0	0	Semifinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
2399_8	I think it's been very good. I did better than I ever had before. I had some very good matches. And, you know, I thought I played good tennis. I thought I dealt with everything that was sort of put in front of me well. You know, I'll come back next year and try and do better. But it was a good tournament. Wasn't bad at all.	2399_8.a	2009-07-03	M	2399	Andy Roddick	Andy Murray	Overall, how would you assess this tournament?	2399_8.q	3.0	0	Semifinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
2399_9	Yeah, I think I have a chance. And I think the way that I played this year, you know, it was very, very close to getting to the final. If I give myself those sort of opportunities and keep playing well, and my consistency in the Grand Slams the last year or so has been much, much better, you know, a final, a semi and a quarter, I'm going to give myself opportunities to do it. I believe I can win a Grand Slam, whether it's Wimbledon or US Open or Australia or whatever, I'm going to give myself chances.	2399_9.a	2009-07-03	M	2399	Andy Roddick	Andy Murray	On that point, you went a round further than last year; you're 22 years old. You'll leave here more convinced that you can win Wimbledon now?	2399_9.q	3.0	0	Semifinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
2399_10	No, I wasn't saying anything to them. I was just trying to get -- you know, obviously when it gets to the big points, the important sort of moments in the match, it's great to have the support. They were excellent the whole tournament with me. You know, hopefully I'll have the same support again next year.	2399_10.a	2009-07-03	M	2399	Andy Roddick	Andy Murray	Did you say something to the crowd at the end? What would you say to the fans about coming back stronger next year?	2399_10.q	3.0	0	Semifinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
2399_11	No, I'll move on very, very quickly and go and work on my game and improve and come back stronger. That's a pathetic attitude to have, if you lose one match and you go away and, you know, let it ruin your year. You know, I've had a very good year so far. I'm very close to, you know, the top of the game. The US Open I've always said is my best surface, my best chance to win a slam, and I'll give it my best shot there.	2399_11.a	2009-07-03	M	2399	Andy Roddick	Andy Murray	Will you be able to move on from this, or do you think, you know, I lost to a better guy on the day?	2399_11.q	3.0	0	Semifinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
2399_12	Yeah, I've got five weeks before the next tournament. I'm not a hundred percent sure what I'll do next. But, yeah, I'll take a little bit of time off and then go over to train in America before the stretch over there.	2399_12.a	2009-07-03	M	2399	Andy Roddick	Andy Murray	Will you have a break before you go back to the court?	2399_12.q	3.0	0	Semifinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
2399_13	Well, obviously I don't get a chance to go back there as much as I would like. But, you know, my friends and my family tell me the support's been great. So, you know, that's awesome. Regardless of who's supporting you, it's always nice when you've got people behind you. I'm sure Scotland were rooting for me.	2399_13.a	2009-07-03	M	2399	Andy Roddick	Andy Murray	Are you aware of the level of support you've had back in Scotland? How much do you appreciate that?	2399_13.q	3.0	0	Semifinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
2399_14	I've liked it ever since I went there as a junior. I played there the first time I think when I was 15 or 16. I love New York. It's one of my favorite cities to go to. The atmosphere on the courts is great. I love the center court there. You know, it's pretty incredible to play there when the crowd's full. That's it. I really, really like the atmosphere there.	2399_14.a	2009-07-03	M	2399	Andy Roddick	Andy Murray	You've talked for years about your feeling for the US Open. Has to be more than just the surface. What do you like about that tournament?	2399_14.q	3.0	0	Semifinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
2399_15	Yeah, I mean, that stuff just annoys me when you're totally rushed into it. You know, you can ask -- the amount of times that you get given a code violation when the line judge goes up to the umpire if you said something at the back of the court quietly, and the line judge goes up to the umpire and tells him, in a situation like that, if he gives me a code violation and I argue it, he could also just ask one of the line judges what I said. And, you know, when you say like, Hit the pass, and you get a code violation for that, it's a bit disappointing. So I hope I get an apology.	2399_15.a	2009-07-03	M	2399	Andy Roddick	Andy Murray	I'm sure you'd like to clear up the code violation warning.	2399_15.q	3.0	0	Semifinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
2399_16	I'm not sure. I mean, I need a bit more time to think about that. But, like I said, it's been a very good, productive tournament for me. I think, like I said, I played well. You know, unfortunately the last few slams that I've lost I've come up against some guys that have played great, great tennis. You know, mentally for me, I've got much better at it, understanding that guys can do that against you. That's happened to me a few times now in slams. I need to keep making sure I bring my best game to the court in every match.	2399_16.a	2009-07-03	M	2399	Andy Roddick	Andy Murray	What is the overriding memory or lesson that you take from this slam to put into future matches?	2399_16.q	3.0	0	Semifinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
2399_17	Well, I don't think -- I mean, I put obviously pressure on myself to play well. I don't think there was any sort of moments where I felt too tight to sort of go for shots. I maybe made a couple of mistakes that I shouldn't have in the first tiebreak. But if you look at the amount of winners I hit compared to him, I don't think that I could say I wasn't swinging freely. I think I hit twice the number of winners as him.	2399_17.a	2009-07-03	M	2399	Andy Roddick	Andy Murray	Roddick said because all the pressure was on you he could swing more freely than you. Do you agree?	2399_17.q	3.0	0	Semifinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
2399_18	Maybe coming to the net is something that, you know, I have worked on a lot, but I haven't used it that much in the matches. The thing that is quite tough now, because of the way the rankings and stuff work, all of the tournaments become very, very important. So it's tough to sort of go on the court and just work on things in matches. But that's something that I practice a lot and I'll try and get better at.	2399_18.a	2009-07-03	M	2399	Andy Roddick	Andy Murray	Which part of your game do you want to improve the most?	2399_18.q	3.0	0	Semifinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
2399_19	I think Federer has a good return. I don't think that it's incredible. He doesn't break serve as much as a lot of the guys. But he'll make Andy play. And Andy gives him enough chances, Roger's gonna take them. That's the one thing he needs to serve very well, especially at the start of all of the games to try and get ahead, not give Roger that chance to sort of swing freely at balls. If he can always sort of stay 15-up, 15-Love, 30-Love up in games, it's gonna be tough. But obviously Roger is the favorite. If he plays his best and passes well, then there's no reason why he can't win.	2399_19.a	2009-07-03	M	2399	Andy Roddick	Andy Murray	Talk about the matchup and shots between Andy's serve and Federer's incredible return of serve. How do you think that might work out?	2399_19.q	3.0	0	Semifinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1669_0	He's a very good player, no? Young player, plays very well and serve really well. Good level, no? I like it much. Maybe the fifth set I did my best point and he take the chance, no?	1669_0.a	2008-08-30	M	1669	Kei Nishikori	David Ferrer	So how was today's match and how was Nishikori?	1669_0.q	4.0	0	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1669_1	My condition? Now I'm not too much happy, but it's okay, no? I fight a lot, and Nishikori plays better than me I think.	1669_1.a	2008-08-30	M	1669	Kei Nishikori	David Ferrer	How is your condition?	1669_1.q	4.0	0	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1669_2	No, four sets.	1669_2.a	2008-08-30	M	1669	Kei Nishikori	David Ferrer	You won a terrific five-setter against Nadal - I might be mistaken - last year.	1669_2.q	4.0	0	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1669_3	Last year is past and now is present. I think every match is different, no, different points, different conditions, and I don't think so.	1669_3.a	2008-08-30	M	1669	Kei Nishikori	David Ferrer	But nevertheless, do you relish a night match that really is a slugfest in the end, a very difficult match both ways, that lasts a long time?	1669_3.q	4.0	0	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1669_4	No, I don't know. Maybe the first set I was 4-2 with break up, and I play so bad this game, no, with my serve. I don't serve very well. Maybe in the fifth set I don't serve very well. I played very regular all the match. Sometimes good, sometimes bad. But this is tennis and Nishikori plays pretty well.	1669_4.a	2008-08-30	M	1669	Kei Nishikori	David Ferrer	In the first two sets it looked like you were having some trouble returning his serve. Was it just too hard for you? Was it just hard to see?	1669_4.q	4.0	0	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1669_5	No, no. Because I know Nishikori won this year tournaments to Blake. No, I know surprise.	1669_5.a	2008-08-30	M	1669	Kei Nishikori	David Ferrer	Did he surprise you in the first couple sets, like how high of a level he was playing?	1669_5.q	4.0	0	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1669_6	I don't think nothing. I am focus on my game and for the next point, no? I don't think nothing.	1669_6.a	2008-08-30	M	1669	Kei Nishikori	David Ferrer	He called the doctor, trainer. How did you think about it?	1669_6.q	4.0	0	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1669_7	No, it's not a problem, no? It's the rules of the game, no? He can call to the training, and he did.	1669_7.a	2008-08-30	M	1669	Kei Nishikori	David Ferrer	Do you think you should have maybe called the trainer yourself?	1669_7.q	4.0	0	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1669_8	Well, my forehand, no? I did -- I had big problems with my forehand and I did made mistakes, a lot of mistakes. And him, no, maybe the backhand of him really well, no.	1669_8.a	2008-08-30	M	1669	Kei Nishikori	David Ferrer	Which shot made you difficult to play from Kei?	1669_8.q	4.0	0	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1669_9	It's normal, no? It's my mentality. It wasn't to be nervous. But if I don't stay nervous I cannot play very well, no? I need this one, and, no, nothing.	1669_9.a	2008-08-30	M	1669	Kei Nishikori	David Ferrer	Looked like you were getting a little unnerved out there and banging the racquet. Did it hurt you at all when you were getting upset? Do you feel like you were a little bit frustrated?	1669_9.q	4.0	0	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1669_10	He's a very good player, no? I know that. I was saw last year in Tokyo and I like it too much. It's not a surprise. For sure he will be a very good player, no?	1669_10.a	2008-08-30	M	1669	Kei Nishikori	David Ferrer	Are you impressed with Nishikori? He's only 18 but he plays with a lot of poise, like he's 25 or something.	1669_10.q	4.0	0	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
5690_0	No, I mean nothing major. You know, obviously I played that match in Hobart and went down in straight sets. But the last three times we played I had good success. I kind of knew what I wanted to do. I don't think there was anything major that I had to change. Obviously I tried to return a little better today, I thought I served better, all around didn't give her so many free points. Little things, but not anything we had to go out and spend hours on court trying to think about.	5690_0.a	2014-01-13	F	5690	Klara Zakopalova	Samantha Stosur	Was there any major adjustment made in the last 72 hours or a totally different ballgame?	5690_0.q	17.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5690_1	Yeah, absolutely. That was a big part of going into today's match. I knew she was going to hit some winners, she was going to play some really good points. I also knew if I didn't have a shot and I kind of stayed in there, used my slice, I didn't think she liked too much in Hobart, then I was going to be able to get myself back in the point even if I was down. Like I said, she was getting some winners, but I also had to think I was going to be able to hang in there as well until I got an opportunity to try and hit a winner or do something I really wanted to do.	5690_1.a	2014-01-13	F	5690	Klara Zakopalova	Samantha Stosur	You looked far more patient in the points.	5690_1.q	17.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5690_2	Yeah, the ball was definitely flying around. It was pretty hot out on court. You get that response from the court and balls when it's hot and the sun is shining. I was jumping and using my spin and all that whenever I was able to, so that was nice.	5690_2.a	2014-01-13	F	5690	Klara Zakopalova	Samantha Stosur	The conditions suited you a bit more today?	5690_2.q	17.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5690_3	Yeah, it was definitely a big game. From 41 down, obviously I got that momentum to get those next three games, then serving at 4, you have to think, Okay, you got that momentum, you want to hang onto it, play a really good game. If she's going to break, she's going to have to hit some winners. It was pretty long. Thankfully I was able to serve well at the right times. I knew it was important. I wasn't going to try to do anything silly. Play smart, and thankfully I got through that one.	5690_3.a	2014-01-13	F	5690	Klara Zakopalova	Samantha Stosur	How big was the ninth game to maintain the momentum?	5690_3.q	17.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5690_4	It's a really good feeling, obviously. The first hurdle is quite often the hardest. To come out and play, play a pretty decent match, I'm very pleased obviously. A bit of a relief there as well. Very happy to get through and obviously rectify what happened a few days ago is also very pleasing. First one's down. Doesn't mean I'm looking further ahead. I have to focus on this next match and take my second round just as seriously, just as importantly. That's what I'll do.	5690_4.a	2014-01-13	F	5690	Klara Zakopalova	Samantha Stosur	Mentally what does that do for you, to get one done?	5690_4.q	17.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5690_5	Yeah. Sometimes you've got to let some frustration out. I did feel like at times throughout that period I was kind of just putting it back in there. Even though I needed to be patient, you got to still be looking to have some intent with it. I felt like I'd kind of got away from that for those few points a couple of games. She was able to dictate and do what she wanted to do. Yeah, sometimes you just got to tell myself what to do. If it comes out a bit loud, so be it (smiling).	5690_5.a	2014-01-13	F	5690	Klara Zakopalova	Samantha Stosur	You don't often admonish yourself. You yelled at yourself, Stop pushing the ball. Do you remember that?	5690_5.q	17.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5690_6	Not necessarily. Nothing really technical or anything like that. I guess there's always little things that you can focus on. That's kind of what the focus has been. I think I said the other day, I think as I play more matches, then it becomes a little bit easier probably to try and make some, you know, different changes or tactical changes or anything like that. I think I'm still trying to play my tennis and go out there and play the way I want to play. Obviously with these little things in the back of my mind, I know that we've been talking about and trying to work on. So it's good.	5690_6.a	2014-01-13	F	5690	Klara Zakopalova	Samantha Stosur	Early days. How is it going with Miles? Tinkering going on?	5690_6.q	17.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5690_7	Yeah, I won't tell anyone just yet (smiling).	5690_7.a	2014-01-13	F	5690	Klara Zakopalova	Samantha Stosur	Those little things will remain secret?	5690_7.q	17.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5690_8	Yeah, it was a great crowd. I definitely felt all the support out there, which is a great feeling. I know that, yeah, they were getting behind me. When you are down in a set like I was, then you start creeping back, then you get back, that's obviously when they get really excited and they really start trying to help you over the line, get behind you even more. It's even good. Even in some tight moments, they yell out something funny. Makes you have a bit of a laugh, relax a little bit. So, yeah, it's fun playing out there.	5690_8.a	2014-01-13	F	5690	Klara Zakopalova	Samantha Stosur	How much did the crowd come into it for you?	5690_8.q	17.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5690_9	I didn't see any of the Sydney tournament. But to go through quallies and win a tournament as tough as what Sydney was, she must be playing very well. I kind of know her game a little bit. We played each other in the Tournament of Champions, the last one of the year actually. I played her there. I mean, completely different circumstances. Court was indoor, very slow, gritty court in Sofia. If I end up playing her, it's going to be a different ballgame. I know what to expect a little bit, but she must be in pretty decent form to have gone through and have won Sydney.	5690_9.a	2014-01-13	F	5690	Klara Zakopalova	Samantha Stosur	Talk about your possible next opponents, especially Pironkova.	5690_9.q	17.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5690_10	I don't usually struggle in the heat. So that's fine. I practiced here through December. There was some pretty hot days in Sydney. Got through those all right. Tournament play is always that little bit different. If you do all the right things, try to stay hydrated, look after yourself, hopefully by the time you get out on court, you won't have any problem. Touch wood, that will be the same for me.	5690_10.a	2014-01-13	F	5690	Klara Zakopalova	Samantha Stosur	Pretty impressive heat over the next couple days. Does that play to your advantage?	5690_10.q	17.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
2168_0	I felt good, you know. It's always nice to be back on the match courts, you know, after spending so much time on the practice courts. I was happy with my performance today. It was a tough match, because Fred was serving really well and made it hard to get any kind of rhythm because I was serving well myself. It was a good first match, and I'm pleased I'm through.	2168_0.a	2009-08-11	M	2168	Frederic Niemeyer	Roger Federer	How did you feel out there, first match back since Wimbledon?	2168_0.q	1.0	1	2nd Round	ROGERS CUP	Masters 1000
2168_1	Well, I mean, it was -- it all depended on Mirka, if she wanted to make the trip or not, and obviously if the babies were going to be ready to do it or not. It really all depended on that. That's why I kind of mentioned it to her like one week before the event starts here, and I went from day to day, and at the end we said, all right, I think everything looks all right. And like this, we going to be anyway then together for a long time in North America. That's what she wanted. That's what I wanted. That's why we decided to do it that way.	2168_1.a	2009-08-11	M	2168	Frederic Niemeyer	Roger Federer	Can you take us through the process of deciding to play here rather than waiting for an extra week to come back?	2168_1.q	1.0	1	2nd Round	ROGERS CUP	Masters 1000
2168_2	Well, we know each other since I guess 11 years, because we played each other in, I think it was in '97 or '98 in the Swiss Satellite in front of -- you know, like I said on court like in front of two people, and other guys were playing next to us. The atmosphere was rather cold because it was a Winter Satellite in Switzerland and there was a ton of snow outside. Next thing you know, 11 years later we're playing in front of a packed house here in Montreal. It's a long time coming for both of us. A lot has happened since, but we kind of always, when we saw each other on tour, we always tried to maybe hit together or at least have a chat together. I always had a lot of news also from the Swiss players of how he was doing, and he's a very nice man. Of course, it's always sad when you leave the game, but he seems at peace with himself by doing this big step. I can only wish him the best.	2168_2.a	2009-08-11	M	2168	Frederic Niemeyer	Roger Federer	This was probably the last match for Frederic in Montreal. Tell us about your relationship, what you think about him as a player and a person?	2168_2.q	1.0	1	2nd Round	ROGERS CUP	Masters 1000
2168_3	Well, in the beginning after, let's say, five, six weeks of not having played a match, because you play practice matches but that's not the same, you're just a little bit slow sometimes, your reaction on the return. Maybe your shoulder is a little bit slower as well, you know, after having only played practice matches. But, you know, today all in all, I thought it was okay. I wish I could have gotten more balls back on the return, but then that is again due to him serving well and mixing it up well. But, you know, once there is not much rhythm from the baseline, it's always kind of difficult, and then it comes down to a couple of points here and there and that's how this match was being played, as well, today.	2168_3.a	2009-08-11	M	2168	Frederic Niemeyer	Roger Federer	Obviously after a few weeks off there is some rust you have to shake off. How much of what you did out there tonight was rust and how much of it, if any, was adjusting to your new routine, your new lifestyle? Was there any part of that into it? Did you have to make some adjustments, some changes?	2168_3.q	1.0	1	2nd Round	ROGERS CUP	Masters 1000
2168_4	No, because, I mean, I got to be a little bit active to stay in shape and to be ready for the matches. Otherwise I'd rather stay home and do one week, you know, much less and spend time with the family. But once I commit to playing a tournament, I have to do a few certain things to be in decent shape for a tournament. Mirka is great, you know. She handles it well. I think myself, too; quite laid back, you know, hands on. It seems it's working so far.	2168_4.a	2009-08-11	M	2168	Frederic Niemeyer	Roger Federer	Off the court there was no change to your routine or anything? Life goes on as normal?	2168_4.q	1.0	1	2nd Round	ROGERS CUP	Masters 1000
2168_5	I mean, you'll always find injured players, you know. You can talk about the same thing in six months' time. You'll always find an injured player. Maybe I'm one of them; I hope not. I try to make sure I am not, you know. I mean, I try to have as good a schedule as possible, you know. I mean, you have to play some certain tournaments which you're, in a way, obliged to play, but at the same time having vacation, having enough practice and doing the right things, you know, I think is key to a player's career. I guess you need a little bit of luck, as well. If you're injured a lot when you're younger and you play on them instead of maybe taking that break because you have bad advice maybe early on, you know, you carry it through your entire career sometimes, and that then can be a hard thing. I think Rafa has done actually pretty well considering how hard his game is and how many matches he's played for so many years. He hasn't gotten injured that many times. That's why I'm happy to see him back on tour. He was only away from the game a little bit, but in tennis terms it's so much because our season never ends. It's from January to November. If you miss two months, it just seems like it's a lot, but it's actually not that much, and I hope now he can stay on tour and not get injured again.	2168_5.a	2009-08-11	M	2168	Frederic Niemeyer	Roger Federer	You're not the only person who -- Rafa is also back on tour now after a few weeks off for very different reasons. His knee is of concern for everyone. Everyone is watching to see how he does. Gal Monfils came in and his knee was iced. David Nalbandian is out with hip surgery. James Blake has a foot injury. How do you manage to stay so injury-free? Is there any special precaution that you take? You seem particularly good remaining injury-free.	2168_5.q	1.0	1	2nd Round	ROGERS CUP	Masters 1000
2168_6	Yeah, I mean, I definitely had to weather the storm, you know, to some degree. We're not talking about me dropping outside of the top 100 or anything. It was like going from 1 to 2 and that seemed like a disaster for some. (laughter.) For me, that was still okay, because I was still -- you try to hang on to a few things. My thing was trying to hang on to the results in the Grand Slams, and there I reached always semifinals or better. That's why, for me, there was no real need to panic. I was achieving still, you know, regular semis and finals of other events so it wasn't all that bad. But considering what my, you know, what my goals are and where the media and fans see me, it was tough times, you know, because not only was I maybe not winning the tournaments again I used to, but I was losing to some of those close. Sometimes, like in Paris last year, you know, Rafa crushed me there. It's hard to bounce back from some of those losses. I'm a strong believer, you know, in that things turn around if you do the right things, and I'm happy -- you know, I got back in shape, you know, after the back problem, after the mono and everything. It was a tough one-and-a-half years, but, you know, I hung in there, and as it shows, it pays off. It's been an amazing summer because I've had like a full career in like three months. It's been quite something.	2168_6.a	2009-08-11	M	2168	Frederic Niemeyer	Roger Federer	A year ago this time you had an uncommonly early exit from the tournament when it was in Toronto, and obviously what a difference a year makes. You have two Grand Slams under you're belt since then. A lot has changed, but what you sort of taught so many people way beyond the bounds of tennis is about persevering in the way of criticism, doubt, difficulties. And I'm just wondering if you can comment a bit on how you might do that, what you hold on to? Because that is a real lesson for everyone in and out of the sport.	2168_6.q	1.0	1	2nd Round	ROGERS CUP	Masters 1000
2168_7	Not really. For me, I don't want to say this is like a small tournament, but I got so much pressure everywhere I go that sometimes it's just nicer to play those one-week events, not just the Grand Slams, because those -- Paris and Wimbledon back to back, if you reach finals in both, you know, it swallows six to eight weeks, because you prepare for Paris. Then you prepare for Wimbledon, and then Wimbledon is over and you have the after-effects and you go through three months where you're only playing Grand Slam tennis and it takes a lot out of you. That's why it's important to take a break. But then when I've had enough of a break and I've practiced a lot, then I'm happy again to go back on tour. It doesn't matter what tournament it is, because I always find something I like about the tournament, and the stadium here for instance is great. People are very friendly and very welcoming. That definitely helps for me choosing, for instance, to come to this event.	2168_7.a	2009-08-11	M	2168	Frederic Niemeyer	Roger Federer	How much do you look forward to a tournament like this right now at this stage of the career you're in? How hard is it to get motivated to come out here to Montreal, for instance? Although it is a Masters event, is it still hard to get motivated with everything you've achieved?	2168_7.q	1.0	1	2nd Round	ROGERS CUP	Masters 1000
5318_0	Well, I mean, I saw quickly that he was hitting the ball hard and flat through the court. You don't want to then move backwards and just try to make the shot because then he can really even go bigger on it. You know, I decided also to play aggressive. By doing that, didn't have many rallies. It was more of a serving contest. Yeah, so there wasn't much rhythm out there, but I was happy the way I played, you know, overall. I mean, it's a first round after all. There was a bit of a breeze. Should have played at night. Played during the day. Overall I'm pleased to be in the next round.	5318_0.a	2013-08-27	M	5318	nan	Roger Federer	You did a really good job moving forward in the court. Was that the game plan coming in?	5318_0.q	7.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
5318_1	Yeah, it didn't really matter. The only thing I would have liked then to practice more yesterday. But that's not going to, you know, make a huge difference, I don't believe. They canceled I thought fairly quickly last night. It was 11:30 by the time I got back to the hotel. But it wasn't nervewracking or anything waiting last night. You know, it was 5All in the first set, deuce. The match didn't even start yet. So nerves were calm. From that standpoint I didn't lose extra energy that way.	5318_1.a	2013-08-27	M	5318	nan	Roger Federer	Were you fazed much by having to switch schedule?	5318_1.q	7.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
5318_2	Yeah, I'm very happy for tennis in general. For you guys, for the fans, for the players who are going to be able to enjoy all of that. Because I think it's really the night sessions that can get washed out in a big way. Everybody's looking forward to the big night match, and then all of a sudden you don't have much margin because you're not going to send bestoffiveset matches out on court at 11:00, 12:00. So at night with the roof you always have a guaranteed match. For TV it's huge. I think it is a future that we have to go. We saw it again last night. Everybody loses in a situation like that, I believe.	5318_2.a	2013-08-27	M	5318	nan	Roger Federer	Were you pleased to hear they're going to put a roof on the stadium?	5318_2.q	7.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
5318_3	Oh, no, I have extra gluten (laughter). No, I mean, I don't. I've always paid attention to what I eat. I've always been a healthy eater. Clearly you can take it to the next step, you know, when to eat, exactly what, before the match, during the match, after the match, what to eat exactly if you're not sure. I grew up sort of as a vegetarian when I was younger. I'm happy I can eat a bit of everything today, which makes it easier overall. I've seen some nutritionists from time to time, but nothing crazy or major really.	5318_3.a	2013-08-27	M	5318	nan	Roger Federer	Some players are interested in the glutenfree diet. What do you think about that?	5318_3.q	7.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
5318_4	Yeah, I mean, I guess I was happy to hear it, you know, because I really have enjoyed playing against James. I think it's always nice when you can go out on your terms. I mean, he could still play for years to come. He knows that. But I think eventually maybe he just felt like, It's good for me. I've accomplished everything I've wanted. I want to go out on my terms. It's in New York, which makes total sense for him. I've had some good matches against him. Maybe the biggest matches of his career, except maybe the match he played here against Agassi. Cincinnati, Shanghai. I've had some big matches against him, also the Olympics where he beat me. We go way back. We always used to practice a lot together, have good times on tour. So I'll miss him, but he's probably going to stay around tennis some. That's good to hear. I think it's always a pity when you leave the game entirely and you never see the guy again. With James, I hope he'll stay around.	5318_4.a	2013-08-27	M	5318	nan	Roger Federer	With James Blake announcing yesterday his plans to retire after this tournament, what are your thoughts on what he's meant to the game?	5318_4.q	7.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
5318_5	I mean, I've always been a big fan of James. I think it's ranked one of the greatest shots out there because his takeback is extremely quick. You cannot see where he hits it. He can also hit it moving backwards or forwards. He can pull the trigger. So you're never quite safe when you go to that side. It doesn't matter if it's pulled out to the forehand or insideout forehand. With his footwork, he got to many balls that you would think he would just get to, but he would hit a screaming winner off it. That's what made him so dangerous and so hard to play for so many years. For me it's one of the great forehands out there.	5318_5.a	2013-08-27	M	5318	nan	Roger Federer	Can you talk specifically about James' forehand. How would you compare it with the other big ones you've faced as a weapon?	5318_5.q	7.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
5318_6	Just rhythm. Hardly had any rallies today. Decided to go and just work out some more on the practice courts, yeah.	5318_6.a	2013-08-27	M	5318	nan	Roger Federer	(Question about practicing after match today.)	5318_6.q	7.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
5318_7	Don't know. I mean, right now I love it.	5318_7.a	2013-08-27	M	5318	nan	Roger Federer	James is at a stage in his life where he doesn't have the passion to want to continue. It's not physical. With yourself, is it unforeseeable right now for you to say you would ever lose the passion to play this game or do you see that day someday coming?	5318_7.q	7.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
5318_8	Yeah, I think so. Clearly when you win everything, it's fun. That doesn't necessarily mean you love the game more. You just like winning, being on the front page, lifting trophies, doing comfortable press conferences. It's nice. But that doesn't mean you really actually love it, love it. That maybe shines through maybe more in times when you don't play that well. For me, I knew it, winning or losing, practice court or match court, that I love it. So I've been around for too long. Clearly when I had, you know, my two girls, I also wasn't sure right off the bat how it was going to be after that. Was I going to be able to play the same schedule? Was my love for the game as big? Were we going to be able to cope with the whole thing, having twins or not? Managed it totally fine. They were at the court today. I'm so happy to see them before and after the match. I'm in a good spot right now. I want to enjoy it as long as it lasts, yeah.	5318_8.a	2013-08-27	M	5318	nan	Roger Federer	Is your passion as high as it's ever been?	5318_8.q	7.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
5318_9	Don't remember much of the Rome match to be honest. It's one of those matches I don't remember. But I think he's a very good player. He's got good intensity, forehand and backhand. Can play on the baseline. He's actually really improved a lot on the slower hard courts. This is maybe a tiny bit faster. If we play at night, I think it might suit him a little better. We'll see when they schedule us. He's a fit guy, you know. Trained with him a lot in Rome, in Madrid. We know each other's game pretty well, so we know what to expect. Yeah, he's just been in Switzerland playing TeamTennis over there, winning it. So he's super confident I guess right now.	5318_9.a	2013-08-27	M	5318	nan	Roger Federer	What do you think about Berlocq? You played against him once in Rome. What do you think about the Thursday match?	5318_9.q	7.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
5318_10	Yeah, I mean, I don't know. I mean, I think they're learning as we go long automatically, just getting to meet so many different people, cities and countries and languages, places and travels. You know, I think just by traveling by itself, it's unbelievable how much you learn. Being more independent. I'm still learning still today I feel, even though I know my way pretty much around, what works, what doesn't work. But, you know, I was a very emotional kid. Every kid is emotional, too. I feel I can always relate to kids. If that makes me maybe a good or a bad father, I don't know. I try to teach them right values. So far, so good. But it's clearly rocky, no doubt about that.	5318_10.a	2013-08-27	M	5318	nan	Roger Federer	Like a father, which lesson do you take from sports after so many years which you would like to give to your daughters?	5318_10.q	7.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1683_0	Maybe a little bit. I was nervous going onto the court because I never saw her play before so I didn't know what to expect. I thought I can slowly, get into the match, and she played completely different than I expected. She was serving extremely well and hitting very powerful shots. So I really struggled and made too many unforced errors and my serve was not working really well. Obviously, it's very frustrating, because I know I can play so much better. This was very, very disappointing loss for me, but it's something that I have to accept, you know, especially with everything that has happened in the past probably month or two months. I couldn't expect myself to, you know, to maybe even play better.	1683_0.a	2008-08-28	F	1683	Julie Coin	Ana Ivanovic	Julie said that she felt out there today that she felt you almost seemed nervous. Some errors on the forehand, the double faults. She doesn't know what's in your head, but she said from her perspective it seemed that you were nervous. Maybe playing with the No.1 ranking might have been a lot of pressure for you. Is that a fair assessment of the way you felt today?	1683_0.q	1.0	0	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1683_1	No. I see that as reward because, you know, I think I deserve that position. You know, I won a Grand Slam and I was playing really well. Obviously if you would ask me at the moment if I'm playing like No.1 probably not, but I can't judge too much on that because I really haven't had chance to practice. This kind of loss I had today is just incentive to work harder, to go back on the court and to keep working hard and practicing and improving. Because I think I have possibility to maintain No.1 for a long time and to win a Grand Slam. So I just had a little, you know, unfortunate with injury, and I just have to go back on the court and keep working hard.	1683_1.a	2008-08-28	F	1683	Julie Coin	Ana Ivanovic	Since winning Roland Garros you had a tough Wimbledon and a tough tournament here, both at No.1. I just wonder, do you feel the pressure of No.1, or does that make you play a little different?	1683_1.q	1.0	0	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1683_2	Today I didn't feel it, and also last match was good. So, you know, I'm just happy to be back on track without pain. Now all I have to do is put some hard yards on the court and go back out there and work hard. Because also today I had lots of misshits on my forehand. I think it's also, you know, shows a little bit lack of practice and lack of maybe confidence in that area.	1683_2.a	2008-08-28	F	1683	Julie Coin	Ana Ivanovic	You mentioned the thumb. How badly did the thumb bother you today?	1683_2.q	1.0	0	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1683_3	Yes.	1683_3.a	2008-08-28	F	1683	Julie Coin	Ana Ivanovic	I think you said the other day you went from Beijing to Australia for physio.	1683_3.q	1.0	0	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1683_4	Like I said, I had very tough last couple of months. It's now behind me and, you know, I have to look at the positives. We struggled a lot to find what was wrong with my hand. I couldn't actually practice, so that was obviously frustrating. Obviously now we found solution for it and I feel better. For me, that's really, really good, and that's incentive to now go back on the court and keep working hard, and hopefully with a little bit less traveling.	1683_4.a	2008-08-28	F	1683	Julie Coin	Ana Ivanovic	And then obviously playing in the States prior. I mean, that's a lot of travel. How much do you think that that factored in, having all that travel?	1683_4.q	1.0	0	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1683_5	Her serve was very consistent and very, very strong. She's not such a tall girl, and she was serving really strong and powerful serves. Yeah, had a lot of first serves in as well. It was very hard to get rhythm because I tried couple times, you know, to make longer rally, to slowly get into the match, but she didn't give me options. She was going for her shots and she was playing really well today. And still, I think in the third set I created a lot of opportunities for myself. Just, yeah, didn't quite use them. That was very, very frustrating.	1683_5.a	2008-08-28	F	1683	Julie Coin	Ana Ivanovic	What about Julie's game surprised you the most? Like you said earlier, you didn't know what to expect.	1683_5.q	1.0	0	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1683_6	It was very, very hard, probably the hardest thing about today's match. Okay, if I didn't create those opportunities she was just better. But I think I had lot of chances, and just not being able to use them was very frustrating. Maybe I was a little bit also too hard on myself at some moments. But, you know, I just have to look positive, that I'm pain-free and able to play, and to now go back on court and work hard.	1683_6.a	2008-08-28	F	1683	Julie Coin	Ana Ivanovic	How hard was that for you? Because, I mean, obviously you're used to being able to execute shots. You're out there, No.1 player in the world, and you can't do what you want to do.	1683_6.q	1.0	0	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1683_7	In the third set I had couple. At 2-All, 40-Love, three breakpoints. And also first game of the third set, I think I had breakpoint in that game, too. I had opportunity to step up and put pressure on her straight from the beginning in the third set but couldn't quite use it.	1683_7.a	2008-08-28	F	1683	Julie Coin	Ana Ivanovic	Which one has been your biggest opportunity you think you missed in the match?	1683_7.q	1.0	0	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1683_8	Well, I have to speak with my team and make a plan. We didn't have a chance to do that yet. Obviously, I'm very, very motivated to go straight back on the court. Honestly, I don't need any time off, because I had plenty of it without tennis. I'm ready to get back on the court and keep practicing. I don't know, maybe even leave tomorrow already and get straight back into it.	1683_8.a	2008-08-28	F	1683	Julie Coin	Ana Ivanovic	I know it's not quite easy to ask because it's just after the game, but do you have any specific plans to go back home and regroup and maybe get back to regain the No.1 position, because you may lose it?	1683_8.q	1.0	0	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1683_9	It's very hard. I think Williams sisters, I think they have a pretty good chance. Yeah, I think the top half of the draw, it's quite strong.	1683_9.a	2008-08-28	F	1683	Julie Coin	Ana Ivanovic	Who do you think will win this tournament, and why?	1683_9.q	1.0	0	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1683_10	Well, I think what I experienced so far is girls, when they play against higher-ranked players, they have nothing to lose so they go for their shots. Many times they play matches of their life. Not only in women's tennis, also in men's. When I watch Rafa or Roger or Nole, the players that come up with shots against them is just amazing. They feel no pressure and they're so relaxed to play these kind of shots. She managed, like she said, to stay calm and to play the same until the end.	1683_10.a	2008-08-28	F	1683	Julie Coin	Ana Ivanovic	Julie said that happened when she was out there she didn't feel nervous. It was just another game until it got to the match points. Were you surprised with the poise that she showed out there?	1683_10.q	1.0	0	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1683_11	I know she's very good player and she's very talented girl. But to tell you the truth, I don't know much about the draw or any opponents or who she's playing. Yeah, she's very young, and I'm sure she has good possibility.	1683_11.a	2008-08-28	F	1683	Julie Coin	Ana Ivanovic	How do you see the chances for Caroline Wozniacki to win this tournament, or at least get into the final?	1683_11.q	1.0	0	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
5133_0	Yeah. I actually expected a very tough match. I think it was very tough first round. We had some battles in the past, but I really started well and I was aggressive. You know, I tried to do the things I worked on sort of to translate onto the match court, and I did that well today. I felt like I was doing like lot of damage with my forehand, so I tried to keep that game plan.	5133_0.a	2013-02-11	F	5133	Tamira Paszek	Ana Ivanovic	It looked like you were pretty much in control out there. Maybe talk about the match.	5133_0.q	13.0	1	1st Round	QATAR TOTAL OPEN	Premier
5133_1	I smell like heat cream. (Smiling.) I have to still take care of my shoulder and do treatments every day, but it's been already sore in Pattaya and I kind of tried to push through there. I felt like it was too much risk playing Fed Cup as well with a sore shoulder. I tried to take some time off and come healthy here. And still, it's a process, but it's feeling a lot better.	5133_1.a	2013-02-11	F	5133	Tamira Paszek	Ana Ivanovic	You had to withdraw from the Fed Cup last weekend. How does your shoulder feel well?	5133_1.q	13.0	1	1st Round	QATAR TOTAL OPEN	Premier
5133_2	I actually didn't, because I was here and I couldn't get it on the stream, but I was watching live score and that third rubber was definitely an epic.	5133_2.a	2013-02-11	F	5133	Tamira Paszek	Ana Ivanovic	Did you have time to watch some of the match?	5133_2.q	13.0	1	1st Round	QATAR TOTAL OPEN	Premier
5133_3	Yeah, you know, it's a new season, and, you know, actually when you look at it, time really flies. I really have been working hard in the offseason and I want to put it together this year. Last year I felt I was in a position a lot of times to do well and to come through deep into tournaments, but I never, you know, broke through. So I really want to do that this year. But, you know, it's a process. I really understand I have to work hard. You know, it's one thing saying, you know, I want to get back there, but I want to go out there and do it and do it time after time.	5133_3.a	2013-02-11	F	5133	Tamira Paszek	Ana Ivanovic	How are you feeling in terms of this whole beginning of the season? Because you have had rough patches in your career and great patches.	5133_3.q	13.0	1	1st Round	QATAR TOTAL OPEN	Premier
5133_4	Yeah, definitely. But, I mean, it's been very tough I think rubber for us, and, you know, it was very tough on the girls because both Jelena and I couldn't perform this time, but I really hope we can come together strong again and do what we did last year.	5133_4.a	2013-02-11	F	5133	Tamira Paszek	Ana Ivanovic	Was it tough to see that Fed Cup result considering that you couldn't be there?	5133_4.q	13.0	1	1st Round	QATAR TOTAL OPEN	Premier
5133_5	It would be huge, you know, even just playing against them and seeing sort of where you're at. I definitely feel my game is coming to the point where I can challenge these top players. That's exciting, you know, because if it wasn't like that, I wouldn't be here. This is my big goal. I really want to get myself in a position to play against these top players, because only playing them time and time again you can break through eventually and finally, you know, win.	5133_5.a	2013-02-11	F	5133	Tamira Paszek	Ana Ivanovic	As a former No.1, as you said, you're getting up to that level again. How do you feel with a process of going against Serena and Sharapova this week and beating them? What would it do for that process?	5133_5.q	13.0	1	1st Round	QATAR TOTAL OPEN	Premier
5133_6	Yeah, definitely. And that's something I have been working really hard on, because I think this is going to be a big step for me, because I know I have a game and I know I'm playing well up to that point, so I put really high expectations, and, you know, I want to play the best match of my life. But I have to understand that I might not need to play the best match of my life. I just have to keep doing the same things. Sometimes in that excitement, you know, I burn out, you know, and then I become flat. This is something that I really want to work on. It's a big goal for this year for me.	5133_6.a	2013-02-11	F	5133	Tamira Paszek	Ana Ivanovic	Do you feel you put yourself too much pressure on the big match like against Radwanska at the Australian Open or in the previous big matches you played? Because it seems your level is there in the early rounds, but when you play the biggest ones it seems like you can't execute that game plan.	5133_6.q	13.0	1	1st Round	QATAR TOTAL OPEN	Premier
3113_0	No, my ankle is much better. I think the fact that I was not able to practice for a couple of days because I really needed to rest it, you know, really affected the way I was moving today. I feel I was really affected by the weather conditions. I was going for the wrong shots all the time. Usually it's not happening to me very often. But, yeah, I'm sure I will play better next match. It was, you know, quite tough experience today. Caroline played very solid, as usually she does this season. For me, it was not a good match.	3113_0.a	2010-10-26	F	3113	Caroline Wozniacki	Elena Dementieva	How is your ankle? Having problems?	3113_0.q	9.0	0	Round Robin	WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS - DOHA 2010	SEC
3113_1	Excuse me?	3113_1.a	2010-10-26	F	3113	Caroline Wozniacki	Elena Dementieva	The weather condition are different before today or not?	3113_1.q	9.0	0	Round Robin	WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS - DOHA 2010	SEC
3113_2	I feel it's been very hot and humid the whole week, since my first day here. It's really difficult, because in this kind of humidity, you just lose your concentration very quickly. It's very difficult to stay focused during the match. But, I mean, it's tough for everyone. I have to -- like I said, today was a bad experience. I'm going to learn from that and play a better match next round.	3113_2.a	2010-10-26	F	3113	Caroline Wozniacki	Elena Dementieva	The weather was different last days, or same?	3113_2.q	9.0	0	Round Robin	WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS - DOHA 2010	SEC
3113_3	Well, I think I wanted to take her from the comfort zone. She's feeling very solid at the baseline. For sure it was not a very good selection of shots to do it every single point. Yeah, I just feel like I was not focused on the game today. I could not provide anything better than that.	3113_3.a	2010-10-26	F	3113	Caroline Wozniacki	Elena Dementieva	You play a lot of dropshots. It was your game plan or just a choice in this moment?	3113_3.q	9.0	0	Round Robin	WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS - DOHA 2010	SEC
3113_4	Well, to be honest, I feel there are two favorites during this tournament: Caroline and Kim, because they both are in a great shape. Kim, she's the one -- she won Cincinnati this season playing pretty much the same conditions, so she knows how to deal with the heat and humidity. So for the rest it will be very tough to compete against them.	3113_4.a	2010-10-26	F	3113	Caroline Wozniacki	Elena Dementieva	You said weather conditions were tough here. Is that the key of who's going to win the tournament, who's the best to cope with that?	3113_4.q	9.0	0	Round Robin	WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS - DOHA 2010	SEC
3113_5	Well, I think when it comes to such a hot temperature and the humidity level, it's very hard to get used to it. There is no way you can get used to it. It's just a combination that's killing you. So you just have to be strong, be tough on the court, and try to play as focused as you can.	3113_5.a	2010-10-26	F	3113	Caroline Wozniacki	Elena Dementieva	But it's not the first time you competed here, so you must be sort of used to the heat here.	3113_5.q	9.0	0	Round Robin	WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS - DOHA 2010	SEC
3113_6	I used to serve this way for quite long time already. This is a new motion that I'm using for this season.	3113_6.a	2010-10-26	F	3113	Caroline Wozniacki	Elena Dementieva	Is this a new style of serving?	3113_6.q	9.0	0	Round Robin	WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS - DOHA 2010	SEC
3113_7	Well, we play couple of times before and we know what to expect. Once again, it's going to be all about mental preparation and physical preparation for that match. I think we're all going to be struggling in these conditions. I know she's physically very fit and she moves well, so it's going to be a tough match for me.	3113_7.a	2010-10-26	F	3113	Caroline Wozniacki	Elena Dementieva	Next match is Francesca Schiavone. Do you think you are ready to play against her?	3113_7.q	9.0	0	Round Robin	WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS - DOHA 2010	SEC
669_0	The way I was playing I guess in the sets that I won.  I mean, you know, I knew it was going to be a tough match going in.  I had a lot of -- I wanted the revenge badly from after the US Open quarterfinal match I lost against him because those kind of matches now for me mean a lot more than maybe, you know, eight, nine years ago. It hurt me a lot there for a couple days after the US Open.  Being in the fifth set down a break, I kind of remembered that feeling.  Just trying to hang tough, trying to make him win the match.  That's what makes me really proud.  Then saving match point, as well.  You know, it couldn't have been a better outcome for me.	669_0.a	2007-01-24	M	669	Nikolay Davydenko	Tommy Haas	Apart from the win, what pleased you most about the match?	669_0.q	12.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
669_1	I really don't know.  Five years ago, in 2002 when I got to the semis, a couple months after that I reached my career high of No.2.  I was playing some really solid tennis there for a good year.  But I don't know how I can compare it to now.  I haven't watched any matches from back then and now. But I think the game is getting stronger and better each year.  So I guess I'm playing better than I have in the past.	669_1.a	2007-01-24	M	669	Nikolay Davydenko	Tommy Haas	How is your form now compared with five years ago, last making the semifinal here?	669_1.q	12.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
669_2	Yeah, a little bit.  As soon as I'm done here, get a little bit of a stretch and massage, I'll go back and watch.  I've been watching them anyway, the other matches as well, but I'll watch the match.	669_2.a	2007-01-24	M	669	Nikolay Davydenko	Tommy Haas	Will you watch this match now?	669_2.q	12.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
669_3	Just got a little bit tight.  Sometimes when you get a little bit tight -- you know, I was stretching out for a ball.  Felt like it was tightening up a little bit.  Sometimes a little bit of hot cream or loosening it up can do magic.  I just thought it was important.  It feels fine.	669_3.a	2007-01-24	M	669	Nikolay Davydenko	Tommy Haas	At one stage you called for the trainer on your right thigh.  What was the story?	669_3.q	12.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
669_4	Yeah, the cold breeze.  Sometimes, I don't know, like my eyes don't do well with that.  They just got really watery.  I was asking to see if they had something to make that go away, which I knew was not going to happen.  I guess with eye drops you can try to see if that happens. I just don't have a good history with eye drops either.  I just asked to have a little bit of small talk.	669_4.a	2007-01-24	M	669	Nikolay Davydenko	Tommy Haas	You also seemed to have something irritating your eyes.	669_4.q	12.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
669_5	Just get watery, like I'm almost crying, a lot of water coming out of my eyes.  Every time I'm trying to focus, closing my eyes a little bit.  That kind of bothered me a little bit.  With the shade coming through, I just felt at times I didn't see as sharp as I wanted to.  Just asked to see if there's anything he can do.	669_5.a	2007-01-24	M	669	Nikolay Davydenko	Tommy Haas	Could you not see the ball when you were playing?	669_5.q	12.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
669_6	Not nuts really.  I thought I was playing really well the first set and a half, dictating play the way I wanted to play.  I had a breakpoint at 2-All.  I just made a forehand error that kind of bothered me.  I lost that game. The next game he came up with some good shots to go down Love-30.  Then he returned two good balls.  I lost the 4-2.  Then I kind of just lost my head just a teeny bit.  He kind of got into a groove. That's then what starts happening.  My eyes got watery.  The shade started coming.  So it was a few things that kept going into my head.  There were pigeons flying around in the stadium.  I was focusing on many other things as I sometimes can do. Yeah, he was just getting better and better, and I just lost a little bit of my confidence and my concentration.  The fourth set, the beginning was really important for me.  Once I started playing well and got the break early, I felt like I was coming back to the way I played in the first set.  Then I knew it was going to be a match.	669_6.a	2007-01-24	M	669	Nikolay Davydenko	Tommy Haas	You were having quite a conversation with yourself at one point when it looked pretty grim.  Nikolay said he thought you were going nuts.  Were you going nuts?	669_6.q	12.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
669_7	I played some good ones at the US Open actually.  Before the US Open, though, I've had a lot of tough five-setters where I've lost, got unlucky at times.  It's been a while before that that I actually won a few. At the US Open I played a couple good ones.  There was tiebreak at 6-All and I got two of them against Ginepri and Safin.  Another one actually against Davydenko, which I lost 6-4 in the fifth.  It was one point away.  Same thing, same kind of result.  I'm really happy that that didn't happen.	669_7.a	2007-01-24	M	669	Nikolay Davydenko	Tommy Haas	When was the last time you played a fifth set that well?	669_7.q	12.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
669_8	Yeah, it's good that way.  Obviously I've been here around much more than other players.  It's nice to see the younger players coming up and getting the attention, besides Roger obviously.  That's totally fine.  I can definitely live with that.  I just go out there, mind my own business, trying to, you know, improve my game, play well, play tough. If I do that, like I said, I think I still got a lot of good game in me.  If I stay injury-free, I can enjoy this game for the next many more years hopefully, so be it.  That's good.	669_8.a	2007-01-24	M	669	Nikolay Davydenko	Tommy Haas	Do you feel like you might have snuck under the radar a little bit so far in the tournament?	669_8.q	12.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
669_9	Another reason why I'm really happy today is now I finally beat a Russian in a big match here.  I lost to Kafelnikov in the semis and to Marat in the semis in '99 and '02.  If I would have lost the quarterfinal here against another Russian, it would have been really like never going back there again. But, you know, it's tough.  Like against Kafelnikov that one year, I think he was just playing incredible.  Against Safin, the rain came in the beginning of the fourth set.  I just went to the locker room for 20 minutes, laid down.  That was totally the wrong call.  Couldn't move any more after that. Now we'll just see.  I've got a little more experience obviously.  I'm really happy, more experienced, more aware of the situation where I'm at.  Now just see who is going to be my next opponent.  Obviously it's not getting any easier.  Just going to try my best.  That's all I can do.	669_9.a	2007-01-24	M	669	Nikolay Davydenko	Tommy Haas	Can you use anything from the memories of the previous two semifinal appearances this time?	669_9.q	12.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
669_10	Laid down?	669_10.a	2007-01-24	M	669	Nikolay Davydenko	Tommy Haas	What do you mean you laid down?	669_10.q	12.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
669_11	In '02, yeah.  The rain came, obviously the Rod Laver roof closes, takes like 20 minutes.  I was laying down just to kind of stay calm.  After that I got up and I had no more legs left.  That was a bad call.	669_11.a	2007-01-24	M	669	Nikolay Davydenko	Tommy Haas	You laid down in the locker room.	669_11.q	12.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
669_12	Yeah, I mean, it's nice.  In the Grand Slams, obviously it's where you want to do well.  At the US Open, I mean, in the quarters against Davydenko, I had a good chance to get to the semis. I didn't make it to play Roger in the semifinals there, which would have been an incredible feeling.  That's why I also said it took me a couple days after that match to really -- actually weeks to recover from that. A lot of things have happened in my career that many other players might not go through.  I don't wish anybody two shoulder surgeries and being away for 15 months, not knowing exactly if you're going to come back or how your shoulder will feel.  I don't think that's an easy task. It happened to me while I was 24, 25 years old.  If it would happen now at 28, 29, it might be a lot different.  It happened to me not too, too bad of a time.  You have to look at that as a positive, I guess.  I'm just happy the way my shoulder's holding up.  I'm enjoying the game.  Just trying to improve.	669_12.a	2007-01-24	M	669	Nikolay Davydenko	Tommy Haas	Do you feel like this result is a long time coming, given everything you've been through, this level of play?	669_12.q	12.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
669_13	Both are playing great tennis, especially these two weeks.  Watched a couple of matches from both of them.  Fernando obviously got a pretty nasty serve, the big forehand.  He's moving well.  Seems like he's trying to use the court much better now that he's been getting some good help from his new coach. Obviously, Nadal, we don't have to talk much about him.  He's a lefty.  That makes him really dangerous.  He fights like crazy and never gives up.  He has a big, big forehand that you can really struggle with, lots of spin. Both of these guys obviously are great players.  Rafael Nadal already having so much experience, desire already, for such a young age is quite phenomenal.	669_13.a	2007-01-24	M	669	Nikolay Davydenko	Tommy Haas	Your thoughts on your potential opponent in the semifinal.	669_13.q	12.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
669_14	Well, it was a great match.  I guess I was the only one that could push him to five sets here last year, which in the end of the day doesn't buy you anything, but makes you feel good, I guess.  It was in the fourth round.  I think I was playing also really good tennis here at the beginning last year to get to the fourth round, playing that match against him. For a little bit of a while there I had a chance to beat him.  At 3-2, just got that unfortunate break to go down 4-2.  He played some good tennis, came up with a lot of winners at the right time.  That's why he is where he is.  There's not much you can really say about Roger's game and how he plays.  We hear it all day and it's true.	669_14.a	2007-01-24	M	669	Nikolay Davydenko	Tommy Haas	Last year, 2-All in the fifth with Roger, when you look back at that match, what do you think happened?	669_14.q	12.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
669_15	Obviously, when you play against top players, maybe you get lucky like you did today every once in a while.  In the end of the day, you can't allow yourself that to happen. But it does make you feel good if it happens and you still come back and win.  Gives you a lot of confidence.  It's the beauty of best-of-five sets.  You can allow yourself maybe a set or two to slip away that way.  At the end of the day, obviously you don't want to that to happen.  We'll have to see who my next opponent is.  Then I really have to focus bit. Obviously, I've played Rafa twice.  It was tough.  Had a few chances in Cincinnati I think in the first set, a couple set points.  I really have to look at it and see how I have to play. Same against Gonzlez, also a tough player.  Doesn't matter.	669_15.a	2007-01-24	M	669	Nikolay Davydenko	Tommy Haas	Nikolay said in his press conference he thought you had a good chance in the semifinal, but he also said you wouldn't be able to go away like you did for the second and third sets and have a chance to win in the semis.	669_15.q	12.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
669_16	Yeah, watched it a little bit.  I think it was a good strategy the way he was playing.  I think Murray is a little bit like me sometimes just losing his head, trying to focus too much what's going on around the game. I think if he can get a clear head and really focus like a Nadal or somebody else, we obviously see what kind of potential he has to go to the top.  Probably no question in my mind he'll be there pretty soon. But it was a great match.  Saw some great rallies.  See the way that Rafa might not be too happy if you play him that way.  At the same time also showed how tough that guy is mentally, that you really have to win the last point to beat him.	669_16.a	2007-01-24	M	669	Nikolay Davydenko	Tommy Haas	If it is Rafa, did you watch Murray the other night?	669_16.q	12.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
669_17	It's one of my biggest matches that I won, for sure.  In the quarterfinals, to save a match point, No.3 player in the world, never beaten him before, coming back from a break down, match point down. Obviously, you know, those are the moments you train for, you work for.  So I let my emotions out obviously.  It was a great, great feeling.  Being here in the semifinals again, you know, eight years later, I mean, it's great.	669_17.a	2007-01-24	M	669	Nikolay Davydenko	Tommy Haas	Very emotional at the end of the match.  Do you think it's a stronger feeling than the last time, last semifinal here?	669_17.q	12.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3904_0	You talk a lot about this match before. I try to stay focus during the last three days about how I wanted to be on the court practicing and everything. And during the match, that was not the same. Much more difficult for me to play. If you want to talk about the atmosphere, it was not as huge as we was waiting for. But it's difficult to talk after losing that match.	3904_0.a	2011-06-21	M	3904	John Isner	Nicolas Mahut	What were your feelings about today's match before, during, and after?	3904_0.q	94.0	0	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3904_1	I think this match change a lot. All my career change after that match. Much more attention. More expectation, as well. As you can see, when the draw was done and when you saw that we were playing each other, we were just talking about this match. I'm sure you're all disappointing about today.	3904_1.a	2011-06-21	M	3904	John Isner	Nicolas Mahut	How did last year's match affect your life?	3904_1.q	94.0	0	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3904_2	It's really difficult to answer in English.	3904_2.a	2011-06-21	M	3904	John Isner	Nicolas Mahut	Last year you were also very disappointed when you lost. Yet it seemed as if you were able to change it into a very positive thing with the book, with everyone giving you such affirmation, telling you how well you did. What changed your view of the match from a disappointment to an achievement?	3904_2.q	94.0	0	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3904_3	You read the book, right?	3904_3.a	2011-06-21	M	3904	John Isner	Nicolas Mahut	It seemed at first you were very disappointed. You felt you let people down by losing that match.	3904_3.q	94.0	0	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3904_4	Yeah, but at first I was really disappointed, but I'm still disappointed. But what we did last year, it's much more than a tennis match, what we show on the court. I'm very proud of it. But this is from last year. Today I just lost the match in three sets. It's a different story.	3904_4.a	2011-06-21	M	3904	John Isner	Nicolas Mahut	Yes. But then you saw that there were many positives to be taken out of it. It seems to us that in many ways you look upon it more fondly than John does, who felt sort of like, I don't want to be known as the guy that won this match, I want to be known for more than that.	3904_4.q	94.0	0	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3904_5	Yeah, I mean, little bit. But I just don't want to talk too much about that. He just played better than me, and that's it.	3904_5.a	2011-06-21	M	3904	John Isner	Nicolas Mahut	John said he thought your movement was hampered by your knee. Can you talk about that. Was it bothering you?	3904_5.q	94.0	0	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3904_6	John, we became very close friends, which is the most important thing for me. And I hope this year he gonna go through the second week.	3904_6.a	2011-06-21	M	3904	John Isner	Nicolas Mahut	What do you feel about John, both from the experience last year and the year in between and today?	3904_6.q	94.0	0	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3904_7	Yeah, of course I would like to. Not first round. You know, I just lost in Wimbledon. It's in one year right now. So I'm really disappointing about the results. I just don't want to think about next year. It's very far away.	3904_7.a	2011-06-21	M	3904	John Isner	Nicolas Mahut	Do you want to play with John next year maybe once again in the first round here?	3904_7.q	94.0	0	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3904_8	I didn't say he played well. I said he played better than me. I think he could play much better than he did. I think he will do it in the next round because I'm sure that was not that easy for him, as well, to play today against me.	3904_8.a	2011-06-21	M	3904	John Isner	Nicolas Mahut	You said John played very well today. Can you describe what you saw in John today.	3904_8.q	94.0	0	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3904_9	You mean?	3904_9.a	2011-06-21	M	3904	John Isner	Nicolas Mahut	Why do you think today was such a different type of match?	3904_9.q	94.0	0	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3904_10	Everything was different. I mean, condition was different. Everything was different. It's another year, another match, another tournament. Was difficult to play this match. We talk about last year during three days. That was not easy. But he handle much better than I did.	3904_10.a	2011-06-21	M	3904	John Isner	Nicolas Mahut	From the last time you played.	3904_10.q	94.0	0	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1672_0	Yeah, I guess so. It would have been nice to have caused her a few more problems. I'm obviously disappointed, but I felt that I had opportunities, and, you know, there was just -- I just felt I hit too many errors on routine points, routine shots. But, you know, I think overall it's been a good week for me. She's the Olympic gold medalist. She's one of the favorites for this tournament. But just for myself, I just feel like I could have done a better job.	1672_0.a	2008-08-29	F	1672	Elena Dementieva	Anne Keothavong	You caused quite a few problems there.	1672_0.q	87.0	0	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1672_1	No, not at all. You know, I've been feeling confident. I was feeling good before the match. Like I said, I think I created opportunities for myself, I just didn't play those points, you know, the way I would have liked to. But like I said, she's the Olympic gold medalist, and she's also feeling very good right now.	1672_1.a	2008-08-29	F	1672	Elena Dementieva	Anne Keothavong	You didn't feel out of place, then?	1672_1.q	87.0	0	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1672_2	Definitely that I can compete with these girls. I don't think the gaps are as big as I once thought. I definitely feel, you know, I know what I need to work on. The best thing about that, I can go back home now and just get stuck in and, you know, work on those things. For me, I do -- I feel like I can climb the rankings. I feel the next stage for me is to breaking into the top 50. That's the next goal for me.	1672_2.a	2008-08-29	F	1672	Elena Dementieva	Anne Keothavong	What's the biggest thing you'll take from this experience this week?	1672_2.q	87.0	0	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1672_3	I don't think -- no, I don't think so. You know, I know I've been working hard. I've been doing a lot of work off the court. I'm in good shape, and, you know, I feel like I'm ready to be amongst these better players.	1672_3.a	2008-08-29	F	1672	Elena Dementieva	Anne Keothavong	So did you surprise yourself this week?	1672_3.q	87.0	0	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1672_4	Yeah, it's nice when it comes together. That match against Schiavone, to get through that in three sets, she's in the top 30 in the world; I think she's been top 22. She's got a lot of experience behind her. Definitely the fact that, you know, over the last couple of weeks, as well, being at the bigger events, tour events, practicing and being amongst the better players. That's given me a lot of confidence, too.	1672_4.a	2008-08-29	F	1672	Elena Dementieva	Anne Keothavong	Has it been a really good week because of the fact you feel you're making progress and you can actually see the progress?	1672_4.q	87.0	0	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1672_5	I'll head home after this and practice for a week or so, and then back out to Asia for a couple of weeks for some tour events out there.	1672_5.a	2008-08-29	F	1672	Elena Dementieva	Anne Keothavong	What will you do? What's your schedule the rest of the year?	1672_5.q	87.0	0	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1672_6	I don't think -- you know, after Wimbledon I made my schedule for the rest of the year. It doesn't change the tournaments I'll be competing in for the rest of the year. They'll be WTA events. I have to look to play in the bigger tournaments. That's where I want to be competing week in and week out.	1672_6.a	2008-08-29	F	1672	Elena Dementieva	Anne Keothavong	Your ranking is going to go up after this obviously. Will that make a difference to the sort of events you're going to be able to play and the number of points you can pick up?	1672_6.q	87.0	0	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1672_7	Well, I haven't put a time deadline on it or anything. At Wimbledon I said I wanted to break into the top 75. You know, I was 76 a couple of weeks ago. I'm sure I'll be inside 75 after this tournament. So obviously the next stage for me, top 50, that's -- I think that's the next realistic goal.	1672_7.a	2008-08-29	F	1672	Elena Dementieva	Anne Keothavong	That top 50 goal, is that for the season?	1672_7.q	87.0	0	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1672_8	We did.	1672_8.a	2008-08-29	F	1672	Elena Dementieva	Anne Keothavong	Did you go to that restaurant last night?	1672_8.q	87.0	0	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1672_9	It was a bit embarrassing last night. It wasn't very busy. A few people sat where we usually sit, so I had to walk out while Claire went and asked them to move. I was too embarrassed to ask myself, but they were very nice about it. Yeah, they moved. (laughter.) Obviously didn't work, though, but you can only ask at the time.	1672_9.a	2008-08-29	F	1672	Elena Dementieva	Anne Keothavong	Did you get the seating plan that you wanted?	1672_9.q	87.0	0	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1672_10	Yeah, definitely. I'm not afraid of these better players, you know. I go out on court and I feel I have a chance against them. Today I definitely feel I had a chance. It just didn't come together in the way I would have liked it to. But again, you know, she's one of the favorites for this tournament, and I'm someone who's ranked 87th in the world right now.	1672_10.a	2008-08-29	F	1672	Elena Dementieva	Anne Keothavong	Do you go away from this now feeling totally comfortable in these surroundings against players like Dementieva, where before you would have had a little bit of worry?	1672_10.q	87.0	0	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1672_11	Yeah, definitely, just being out there on a bigger courts, you know. Obviously more people watching and supporting, it's nice. It's a nice feeling, and it's something, you know, some stage like that is somewhere I want to play and more often. You just have to create the kind of opportunities for yourself to give yourself a chance out there.	1672_11.a	2008-08-29	F	1672	Elena Dementieva	Anne Keothavong	You obviously played at Wimbledon before, as well, but the experience here, has that given you a real taste for playing at this sort of level?	1672_11.q	87.0	0	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1672_12	I guess it was pretty cool. You know, out on -- what was it Court 7, my last match? I felt that was pretty intimate. Today was a bigger court, but I felt in my last match I had quite a bit of support. You know, it's -- again, it's a new experience for me, and I'm learning with each time I'm out there.	1672_12.a	2008-08-29	F	1672	Elena Dementieva	Anne Keothavong	What was it like today compared with playing on the outside courts?	1672_12.q	87.0	0	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1672_13	She was more consistent than I was today. She obviously has a lot more experience in those kind of situations. Everyone told me her serve is her weakness. She didn't give me one point on her serve. I think for her she served pretty well today. Yeah, just playing those bigger points bigger than me.	1672_13.a	2008-08-29	F	1672	Elena Dementieva	Anne Keothavong	What are the differences between you and Elena Dementieva, in a nutshell?	1672_13.q	87.0	0	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1672_14	Definitely. The more I'm around these girls, the more I play against them, the more, you know, I'll learn and the more experience I'll have. You know, most of my career has kind of been made up of ITF tournaments over the last couple of years. You know, I'm now giving myself a chance to go where I want to go.	1672_14.a	2008-08-29	F	1672	Elena Dementieva	Anne Keothavong	Do you think that's something you'll acquire as you play these top players week in and week out?	1672_14.q	87.0	0	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1672_15	Yeah, I guess -- I guess -- I mean, it's the first time we played against each other. You know, I just feel like, yeah, I know I can play better. Yeah, that's just the way it is.	1672_15.a	2008-08-29	F	1672	Elena Dementieva	Anne Keothavong	She was pretty complimentary about you after the match in interview. She said, I thought Anne played really well today. She obviously thought that was your best shot. You didn't think it was your best shot, so I suppose that's quite a positive, really?	1672_15.q	87.0	0	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1595_0	Well, I was just happy because it was a good thing for me to play here in Shanghai. I knew it was a good experience, too. Finally, yeah, I played against Roger the first match. I just wanted to play my chance, and I just wanted to give everything on the court.	1595_0.a	2008-11-10	M	1595	Roger Federer	Gilles Simon	I'm wondering what was your reaction when you found out that you qualified for the event and then that you were playing Federer in the first round? How did you prepare?	1595_0.q	9.0	1	Round Robin	TENNIS MASTERS CUP	Masters Cup
1595_1	Well, I hope I have the game to defeat so many players. It's always hard to win against Federer. I know that I have to play my best tennis. But in another way, it's easier for me because I have just, yeah, I have no question in any head. I just want to give everything, every point to my may best tennis to win. It's easier to play in that way.	1595_1.a	2008-11-10	M	1595	Roger Federer	Gilles Simon	Not many people are able to beat Roger Federer. You've beaten him both teams you played him. Talk about how that feels and also what you think you have in your game to beat him, what bothers him.	1595_1.q	9.0	1	Round Robin	TENNIS MASTERS CUP	Masters Cup
1595_2	Yes, I was really nervous at this time because I had so many opportunities to break him the game before. I lost I think eight points in a row. So it wasn't the best moment of the match for me. But finally I played a good game with a good passing shot and then an ace, then a wonderful lob, too. So I was just happy when I was leading 4-3 in the third because I knew I had just a hard time just before, and then I had the chance to win one more time.	1595_2.a	2008-11-10	M	1595	Roger Federer	Gilles Simon	I would like to ask you in the eighth game in the decider, you were leading, and you were trailing behind and then you came back. What were you thinking about? In the third set, the eighth game of the third set.	1595_2.q	9.0	1	Round Robin	TENNIS MASTERS CUP	Masters Cup
1595_3	Yes, his serve was a little bit slower than unusual. But, like I said, he's not -- he has a good serve, but his serve is not that fast. But he has all the serve. He serve everywhere in the first serve and the second serve, so it's really hard to read. It's never easy to break him because every time it's an important point he always has his first serve. So it was a little bit easier for me, but not that much.	1595_3.a	2008-11-10	M	1595	Roger Federer	Gilles Simon	Could you please compare this match with the Toronto one. Roger said his service is not that powerful because he was conscious with his back. Do you feel so?	1595_3.q	9.0	1	Round Robin	TENNIS MASTERS CUP	Masters Cup
1595_4	Well, like I said, I was first really happy to come here because I was just No. 9. So I knew that I had the opportunity to play. And after when I get into the court, it's to win the match. So I kept that in my mind from the beginning of the match. I felt that I have a chance to win in the second set. I just wanted to do the maximum for that. I defeated him once in Toronto, so it was easier to finish the match. I had no complex when I served in the last game. And, for sure, it was one more time one of the best victory of my career.	1595_4.a	2008-11-10	M	1595	Roger Federer	Gilles Simon	As the one who qualifies for the Masters Cup at the last second, what's your reaction and emotions to make one of the biggest upsets in the history of Masters Cup, to beat Roger, who won here like four times?	1595_4.q	9.0	1	Round Robin	TENNIS MASTERS CUP	Masters Cup
1595_5	A second accident (laughter).	1595_5.a	2008-11-10	M	1595	Roger Federer	Gilles Simon	You beat Roger Federer once. People might call it an accident or surprise. Now it's the second time. What would you call it?	1595_5.q	9.0	1	Round Robin	TENNIS MASTERS CUP	Masters Cup
1595_6	Well, so many questions (smiling). I was, yes, a little bit nervous today because I had really nice sensation when I was practicing this morning, when I was practicing, yeah, yesterday. So I felt that I have a good chance to win. But finally in the first set I didn't play the game I wanted. I was not that much confident on the court because it's never easy to play against Federer. But then, like I said, in the second set I really felt that I have a chance to win, but I didn't manage yet to play my best tennis. So, yeah, I was a little bit nervous when I lost some important points not playing my best tennis.	1595_6.a	2008-11-10	M	1595	Roger Federer	Gilles Simon	I would like to ask you, I notice that during the game a few times you were trying to smash your racquet but you controlled yourself. What were you thinking about? You thought actually you need to be more patient with Roger Federer, considering that he's been suffering from his back pain?	1595_6.q	9.0	1	Round Robin	TENNIS MASTERS CUP	Masters Cup
1595_7	Yes, it's always easier when it's a long match because you lose all your complex and you just play your game when you start to be tired. When it's one hour and a half that you are on the court, you just play your best tennis because you're just thinking about the game. So for sure it helps me. But I didn't wait the beginning of the third set to think that I have a chance to win. Because if you come on the court and if think that you have no chance to win, you just lose in two sets. So I really start to believe in me and my chance to win at the beginning of the match.	1595_7.a	2008-11-10	M	1595	Roger Federer	Gilles Simon	When the game was going to the third set, were you confident that you will win the game? If the match is a bit longer, is it easy for you?	1595_7.q	9.0	1	Round Robin	TENNIS MASTERS CUP	Masters Cup
4271_0	Really normal. I believe that I played a really normal match, nothing special. Nothing very bad, but nothing very good. So just, yeah, normal. That's it. First match on clay after long time, first match after 15 days without touch a racquet, just practicing five, six days. So is happened the normal thing and most important thing is I won 64, 63 in straight sets. Tomorrow I have another chance to keep improving, and that's what I'm going to try.	4271_0.a	2012-04-18	M	4271	Jarkko Nieminen	Rafael Nadal	How did you feel about your performance today?	4271_0.q	2.0	1	2nd Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
4271_1	We'll see, no? We need days to see how all the sensations improve: the knees, the tennis, everything. When you stop for 15 days without practice, physical performance, practice tennis, your body lose a little bit the performance, no? That's something usual. I need practice, and today was a good practice. Tomorrow going to be another tough match against a player who is dangerous. We'll see what's going to happen.	4271_1.a	2012-04-18	M	4271	Jarkko Nieminen	Rafael Nadal	The sensations were pretty good with everything?	4271_1.q	2.0	1	2nd Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
4271_2	The problem is in this sport normally you don't have time. But if happens when you have one month, and you can practice one week and a half, two weeks before a tournament, is not a problem. Two weeks are enough to practice good physical performance, practice hard on court, then the competition. You always need the competition to arrive to the top, no? But in this case I had very short period of time and start one of the most important part of the season for me, so I know that I have to be ready, no? I try to go faster than usual on the recover when you have the problem on the knee to try to be competitive here, and that's what I tried. We'll see if the effort work.	4271_2.a	2012-04-18	M	4271	Jarkko Nieminen	Rafael Nadal	When you have an injury, how long is it usually for you before you can push it 100%, especially with your knee?	4271_2.q	2.0	1	2nd Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
4271_3	I don't think that when I'm playing. I think about the ball. That's enough work for me. And, seriously, I said all day, you know, I feel that I can play with no limitations today. The knee is still there, but is not without impediments to run at every ball. But we'll see. We'll see what's going.	4271_3.a	2012-04-18	M	4271	Jarkko Nieminen	Rafael Nadal	Did you feel you had to be more careful, more cautious?	4271_3.q	2.0	1	2nd Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
4271_4	Normally is strange. Normally is strange to play against Dolgopolov. We'll see. Can be a good match; can be a not very good match. I think Dolgopolov is a funny player, but at the same time he can play at very high level. I played against him few times. Doesn't mean that you play against Dolgopolov will be a funny match because sometimes you go out of rhythm. Can the match become too crazy sometimes. But surely Dolgopolov is inspired and he's playing his best. He's kind of player that is dangerous to play against him. We'll see.	4271_4.a	2012-04-18	M	4271	Jarkko Nieminen	Rafael Nadal	Dolgopolov/Djokovic is the sort of match you would like to watch?	4271_4.q	2.0	1	2nd Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
4271_5	Windy?	4271_5.a	2012-04-18	M	4271	Jarkko Nieminen	Rafael Nadal	Was it particularly breezy out on the court today?	4271_5.q	2.0	1	2nd Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
4271_6	Nothing crazy. On the sea, the sea is in very bad conditions today. But to play tennis, now looks a little bit worst. I saw the David Ferrer match now looks a little bit worst than when I played. But nothing very bad, in my opinion. I played here in very tough conditions.	4271_6.a	2012-04-18	M	4271	Jarkko Nieminen	Rafael Nadal	Yes.	4271_6.q	2.0	1	2nd Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
4271_7	I saw just few games. Nothing. I don't have a really right opinion. I didn't see enough to have an opinion about the match. But sad for him. He's having a fantastic season, so you cannot expect to play your best tennis in every tournament, no? He had a great tournament in Miami, Acapulco, lot of tournaments he play. Auckland, Australia, he had amazing performance, too. Is something that can happen. He had a very bad draw, in my opinion. First round against Bellucci is one of the rounds you don't want to see here. And that happen. But the short period of match that I watched, Bellucci played very aggressive, very hard with his forehand, and was tough to stop him. He has a very good serve and he hit the ball very heavy. Is better to play this match when you have three, four matches in your shoulders on clay, not the first day, and when he already has a match.	4271_7.a	2012-04-18	M	4271	Jarkko Nieminen	Rafael Nadal	Have you seen the match of David?	4271_7.q	2.0	1	2nd Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
4271_8	Was a positive result for us. Last goal was at the last minute, 19th. If you see about the result, I think is nothing negative, no? We'll see. In my opinion, Real Madrid did a good match. Another thing is we scored with 11, my opinion we didn't have enough, I don't know, possession of ball. When we scored 1All, we needed in that moment, because that was the moment  I don't know how to say  to stop the match, have control of the match, have the ball, try to make goals. But we didn't have that chance. Finally had a few opportunities, and we were a little bit unlucky in the last minute. But I feel confident we will go fine.	4271_8.a	2012-04-18	M	4271	Jarkko Nieminen	Rafael Nadal	What did you think of Real Madrid last night?	4271_8.q	2.0	1	2nd Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
4673_0	It was a good match, good first match on grass.	4673_0.a	2013-06-11	M	4673	Benjamin Becker	Bernard Tomic	How did you pull up after that?	4673_0.q	63.0	0	1st Round	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
4673_1	Yeah. I was doing a good job to come back in that third set. He should have won the third set. He should have beat me 62, I think, 63. I was lucky to get back. That's all I can say.	4673_1.a	2013-06-11	M	4673	Benjamin Becker	Bernard Tomic	What were you thinking in that third set when you were down and had to fight back so hard? That must have taken a lot of heart for that comeback.	4673_1.q	63.0	0	1st Round	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
4673_2	Yeah, he was serving well. I knew it was going to be tough. He had more matches than me on grass. He had been playing really well, made the final of the challenger last week. He was a dangerous player to play. Tough tiebreak in the end. I'm happy the way I played. I think it was a good match for my first match on grass and especially back from my injury, so it was good.	4673_2.a	2013-06-11	M	4673	Benjamin Becker	Bernard Tomic	What would you put it down to? He was obviously serving pretty well.	4673_2.q	63.0	0	1st Round	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
4673_3	Last week Thursday, last week Thursday, properly. I was really hitting with one leg for about 20 minutes before that. Still Saturday, Sunday, I wasn't 100% sure, and then Sunday I felt like I could run at 100%, and, you know, didn't really feel it, which was good. It was good news. But probably didn't prepare as good as I should have due to the injury. But close match, came down to one point.	4673_3.a	2013-06-11	M	4673	Benjamin Becker	Bernard Tomic	When were you able to start in again after Paris?	4673_3.q	63.0	0	1st Round	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
4673_4	I didn't see him, to be honest. I didn't look at anything. I wasn't looking anywhere. Funny you spotted him and I didn't. Well, that's interesting.	4673_4.a	2013-06-11	M	4673	Benjamin Becker	Bernard Tomic	Your dad was obviously back in your corner today. Did that help you at all?	4673_4.q	63.0	0	1st Round	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
4673_5	Yeah. Got my best friend working with me now. He's a good mate of mine in Monaco. It's gone good. We will try and see how it goes. Yeah, good first match on grass. I'm happy the way I played. You know, lucky I'm not feeling the leg and I'm getting closer to Wimbledon.	4673_5.a	2013-06-11	M	4673	Benjamin Becker	Bernard Tomic	Have you made any changes to your setup, your coaching staff?	4673_5.q	63.0	0	1st Round	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
4673_6	Yeah. I expected him to be here. I knew he was at my hotel. I saw my dad in the morning. I had breakfast with him. But, you know, it was 50/50 whether he was going to come. I didn't really know he was there today. I wasn't really looking. Wasn't really something I was focusing on.	4673_6.a	2013-06-11	M	4673	Benjamin Becker	Bernard Tomic	You said you didn't know your dad was there. Did you expect him to be here today?	4673_6.q	63.0	0	1st Round	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
4673_7	No, that's just with myself. Yeah, just working with my friend now. Good to have a good relationship with him and my trainer. It's very good. And also my hitting partner that's working with me is very good. So I've got a good team.	4673_7.a	2013-06-11	M	4673	Benjamin Becker	Bernard Tomic	When you said you made changes in your setup in terms of what's happening in Monaco, is that with your management or coaching or...	4673_7.q	63.0	0	1st Round	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
4673_8	Thomas who?	4673_8.a	2013-06-11	M	4673	Benjamin Becker	Bernard Tomic	Can we just clarify with the hitting partner, Thomas Drouet, is that who you're referring to?	4673_8.q	63.0	0	1st Round	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
4673_9	Yeah, that's a good question. No, it's not him. It's another bloke, good friend of mine also from here.	4673_9.a	2013-06-11	M	4673	Benjamin Becker	Bernard Tomic	Drouet.	4673_9.q	63.0	0	1st Round	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
4673_10	Yeah. Yeah, I'm going to play there. Hopefully I can do better there, get a good match, maybe win a match, get some confidence. Should be good.	4673_10.a	2013-06-11	M	4673	Benjamin Becker	Bernard Tomic	Apart from doubles here with Lleyton, what's next week? Eastbourne or what are you doing?	4673_10.q	63.0	0	1st Round	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
3722_0	I think I play a good first set. I had my chances. I couldn't take it. Rafa was -- I think he played good. He didn't do a lot of mistakes, which is normal in his game. I think he played very good, as well.	3722_0.a	2011-09-04	M	3722	Rafael Nadal	David Nalbandian	First of all, what are your thoughts on how Rafa is playing right now? How would you describe the match today?	3722_0.q	76.0	0	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
3722_1	Well, he's a great fighter, so he's gonna fight every day. I believe that Rafa can improve a little bit more, and even during this week. Today was a little windy, a little tough to play sometimes. But I think he can play better.	3722_1.a	2011-09-04	M	3722	Rafael Nadal	David Nalbandian	What are your thoughts about his level in general right now? Obviously he's lost the No.1 ranking to Djokovic. How do you see things shaping up here for the second week at the Open?	3722_1.q	76.0	0	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
3722_2	Yeah, I think he tried to play with first serve today, maybe some tactical things.	3722_2.a	2011-09-04	M	3722	Rafael Nadal	David Nalbandian	About Rafa, forgive me if you addressed this: What do you think of his serve today? How effective was that? It seemed a little more conservative sometimes.	3722_2.q	76.0	0	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
3722_3	Yeah, I think so. Well, I don't know. You have to ask him.	3722_3.a	2011-09-04	M	3722	Rafael Nadal	David Nalbandian	Going for the percentage?	3722_3.q	76.0	0	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
5071_0	Thank you.	5071_0.a	2013-05-10	F	5071	Kaia Kanepi	Maria Sharapova	Wellplayed today.	5071_0.q	2.0	1	Quarterfinals	MUTUA MADRID OPEN	Premier
5071_1	I was just happy to get past the quarterfinals. Feel like I've been stuck in this tournament. So it's nice to be in that stage. I felt like I was facing a really good claycourt player today. A lot of her success has come on clay. Faced her at the French Open where she had really good wins last year, so I know that she's capable. She's playing really well. So I was just really determined. I'm happy that I was able to win with that type of scoreline.	5071_1.a	2013-05-10	F	5071	Kaia Kanepi	Maria Sharapova	Another solid performance. The scoreline suggested it was a fairly straightforward match. How do you feel you played today?	5071_1.q	2.0	1	Quarterfinals	MUTUA MADRID OPEN	Premier
5071_2	Definitely not as slippery as last year. I think it's more slippery than other clay courts, yes.	5071_2.a	2013-05-10	F	5071	Kaia Kanepi	Maria Sharapova	You are moving much better, let's say, every day in clay? What's your opinion of the court? They are slippery like last year or better or how does it suit your game?	5071_2.q	2.0	1	Quarterfinals	MUTUA MADRID OPEN	Premier
5071_3	I don't know. You tell me. (Laughter.)	5071_3.a	2013-05-10	F	5071	Kaia Kanepi	Maria Sharapova	The writing on the camera, I wonder what that was about?	5071_3.q	2.0	1	Quarterfinals	MUTUA MADRID OPEN	Premier
5071_4	Yeah. I think every tournament on the clay is different. I think it's really good adjusting to the circumstances. A week ago I was playing on indoor clay, and this week I'm in a bit of altitude and outdoors. So every week is a new stadium, a new environment. The court plays differently. Even balls play differently. It's really good adjusting. Once you get to the French Open, you give yourself a little bit more time of preparation time to get ready. You know, to have a good few days, maybe a week in Paris, before I play there.	5071_4.a	2013-05-10	F	5071	Kaia Kanepi	Maria Sharapova	Serious things about tennis: Do you think it's a good idea because Madrid has a little altitude to go after to Rome where you have also won? So is it better for the schedule on the way to Paris to play before in Madrid and then Rome?	5071_4.q	2.0	1	Quarterfinals	MUTUA MADRID OPEN	Premier
5071_5	I never thought that day would come. (Laughter.) Where's my trophy?	5071_5.a	2013-05-10	F	5071	Kaia Kanepi	Maria Sharapova	Serious question: I'm sure you're sick of answering questions about how you're good on clay, but when you were younger...	5071_5.q	2.0	1	Quarterfinals	MUTUA MADRID OPEN	Premier
5071_6	Aside from the final a couple years ago and the silver medal last year. No biggie. For some people that's a pretty good achievement. Obviously it's funny when people talk to me it's like, ah, that's not really a great result. I'm like, I don't know. Thinking about that on surgery table, I'll take that any time of the day. You have to be pretty realistic and fortunate. And yes, I lost in the fourth round, and two weeks later I came back at Wimbledon and got to the finals. So that was a great, great week for me. Yeah, I definitely have improved my game on clay and improved myself physically. I also think the grass has changed over the years tremendously. The clay has pretty much stayed the same. But it's not like I woke up one day and said, Yeah, I'm just going to get better and tomorrow I'm going to be better on clay. Instead it took many years and many matches and many practices. And mentally as well just to get myself prepared for long matches and battles and get through them.	5071_6.a	2013-05-10	F	5071	Kaia Kanepi	Maria Sharapova	When you were younger you came on the tour and played well on grass and were really good on grass and not as good on clay. Now it's kind of switched around: You're great on clay and your grass results haven't been as great recently, aside from reaching the silver medal?	5071_6.q	2.0	1	Quarterfinals	MUTUA MADRID OPEN	Premier
5071_7	Yeah, it was in the juniors. I actually played quite a bit of juniors in Europe, along the Czech Republic and Germany. Most of my training was on hard court. A lot of the ITF juniors ended up being on clay. So I did win a few titles. (Laughter.)	5071_7.a	2013-05-10	F	5071	Kaia Kanepi	Maria Sharapova	Going way back, can you remember when you first stepped on a clay court?	5071_7.q	2.0	1	Quarterfinals	MUTUA MADRID OPEN	Premier
5071_8	Absolutely. I think one thing that's interesting about playing today is that you have to realistically think about the generation that's going to be playing after you. I think that was one of the best gifts that Billie Jean King has taught so many players, including myself, was that what you do today will eventually affect the players that you don't even know today in the years to come. That's a very unselfish way to think of it and the very appropriate way to think about what you do and the moves you make on and off the court. Your professionalism, hard work, meetings that you put in that are not exactly convenient. Day before a tournament you're asked to meet with the Grand Slams about prize money, about development of the slams, the future. It's one of the things that you look back on what they did and their motivation and their work, and it helped us today. I think it gives us a pretty good reason to look at it unselfishly for the future. I hope all of us are able to do that for the girls that are young right now.	5071_8.a	2013-05-10	F	5071	Kaia Kanepi	Maria Sharapova	About the 40year anniversary this year of the WTA, and a lot of other anniversaries as well. Battle of the Sexes, for example, with Billie Jean King. When you think back to that time, can you imagine how hard that must have been for those ladies that set up the WTA?	5071_8.q	2.0	1	Quarterfinals	MUTUA MADRID OPEN	Premier
5071_9	Pretty remarkable, really. I remember sitting we had like a fivehour meeting the day before the first round of Istanbul last year, the Championships. I don't think one player in that meeting was really happy about the timing. I will say that every tournament director and a couple of their staff made their way. Craig Tiley flew all the way from Australia just for that meeting. We sat there and they presented kind of their future prize money ideas. Wimbledon, as we all know, is one big secret, so their meeting was the shortest one because they're not really able to give us a lot of information. But everyone made a huge effort. That was really nice to see. But I would say that if it was not for Craig Tiley and his  he happens to be in that first spot of the year, which is not an easy one. When he stepped up, I think that showed the rest that they needed to.	5071_9.a	2013-05-10	F	5071	Kaia Kanepi	Maria Sharapova	At back of that, Maria, what did you think when you saw that Wimbledon were offering almost 40 million pounds in prize money this year?	5071_9.q	2.0	1	Quarterfinals	MUTUA MADRID OPEN	Premier
5071_10	Why start today?	5071_10.a	2013-05-10	F	5071	Kaia Kanepi	Maria Sharapova	On a completely separate subject that has been mentioned today I never thought I would ask this kind of question.	5071_10.q	2.0	1	Quarterfinals	MUTUA MADRID OPEN	Premier
5071_11	Thank you.	5071_11.a	2013-05-10	F	5071	Kaia Kanepi	Maria Sharapova	I sent a tweet yesterday saying I thought signing of the cameras have become one of the most boring things in tennis. You've taken it to a new level in the last couple days.	5071_11.q	2.0	1	Quarterfinals	MUTUA MADRID OPEN	Premier
5071_12	It has been quite spontaneous actually. Some are so spontaneous I don't even know why I'm writing it. (Laughter.) I think I wrote in Palm Springs, Who knows? I wasn't sure why I wrote that. But some other ones have a few meanings, yeah. Yeah, it's fun. I could do the old signature, but for some reason doing something fun and interesting gets people talking about it. Hey, that's why you asked the question. Don't call me a trendsetter now. (Laughter.)	5071_12.a	2013-05-10	F	5071	Kaia Kanepi	Maria Sharapova	Do you think about what you're going to write the day before or the day off? Is it very spontaneous?	5071_12.q	2.0	1	Quarterfinals	MUTUA MADRID OPEN	Premier
5071_13	Just from the WTA? I think Serena would do a pretty good job of that. We all know that. Yeah, she would be a good candidate for it.	5071_13.a	2013-05-10	F	5071	Kaia Kanepi	Maria Sharapova	"Last one on the beginning of the WTA. Billie Jean King told us that day when they met in the hotel to form the WTA, she sent Betty Stover, who was 6'4"", to stand by the door and not let anybody out until they formed it. Who would you put on the door now to stop everyone going out? Who would be security?"	5071_13.q	2.0	1	Quarterfinals	MUTUA MADRID OPEN	Premier
292_0	Well, first match since Australian Open final, so still looking for that rhythm on the court. But I managed to stay mentally tough. Patient in rallies, I thought. As soon as we get through the rally, I have a better chance of winning. He's a very flashy player, aggressive, goes after his shots. Served well. Served well first set. I just utilized my opportunities. His second serve, when his firstserve percentage dropped, I knew that's my chance. I won a lot of those secondserve points. I think that's what decided the match, even though my serve wasn't at the level where I wanted it to be today. So hopefully the next match can be better.	292_0.a	2015-02-24	M	292	Vasek Pospisil	Novak Djokovic	You didn't look entirely comfortable out there this evening.	292_0.q	1.0	1	1st Round	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP500
292_1	Well, of course there is that mental factor for a player, you know, playing against somebody who is, you know, one of the top players on the tour. I remember when I was coming up and playing against Roger, Rafa, in big matches where I felt like the whole tournament I played great, and then against them, for some reason, it doesn't happen the way you want it. That's the pressure of playing against somebody that is so successful and a favorite. I guess coming into the match you already have that mental edge. Doesn't necessarily mean that it's going to stay like that throughout the whole match, so you need to be the one making an impression on the court and showing you are there to win. I guess that's what gives you that push.	292_1.a	2015-02-24	M	292	Vasek Pospisil	Novak Djokovic	Do you feel sometimes when you go on court that players fear you, that they are already beaten before they go on?	292_1.q	1.0	1	1st Round	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP500
292_2	You obviously love him (smiling).	292_2.a	2015-02-24	M	292	Vasek Pospisil	Novak Djokovic	Over the last few days Nadal has sort of been complaining. He says, I'm not the same player I am, I'm tired, my fitness is not good, you know...	292_2.q	1.0	1	1st Round	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP500
292_3	Well, I'm not in his shoes, so I can't really say how he feels. I know him for a long time and I know one thing: that he's a great competitor. He's been struggling with injuries throughout his career, it's obvious. He had couple big injuries that kept him away from the tour for six monthsplus. If he's going to play as well as he did in previous years now in the clay court season or hard court, we don't know. We don't know what tomorrow brings. Obviously he didn't play at the level, you know, that is recognizable for him in Australia. His standard was lower of play. If it is because of the physical fatigue or anything that concerns his physicality, I don't know. I mean, I'm sure that he speaks his mind. But again, an example, he was absent from the tour in 2012 for most of the year and then coming and having his best year of his life, so, you know, you can't really say. It's a bit unpredictable with Rafa because he's such a strong player, and he has a very powerful game so he relies on his strength. He relies on his movement. And if his body is not listening to him, then it's kind of difficult for him to play. But clay court season is coming up. I'm sure that there's where he wants to perform his best. That's the surface that hurts him the least out of all the surfaces on the tour.	292_3.a	2015-02-24	M	292	Vasek Pospisil	Novak Djokovic	Do you think he's bluffing or do you have kind of a thought on his situation?	292_3.q	1.0	1	1st Round	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP500
292_4	They are challenging, but I thought the last two days were quite nice comparing to the weekend. There was a lot of sand in the air, sandstorm and so forth, something that is common for, you know, the desert but is not so common for the time that I spent in Dubai for the last nine years. I haven't seen three days in a row like that. It's a challenge. For us tennis players, we need to be able to adjust very quickly, and that's probably one of the most demanding things about our sport, in sport in general, is the fact that week in, week out, you need to switch from indoor, outdoor, from dry air to humid air, different balls, different surfaces, is that obviously can potentially, if you are not, if you don't have too much time potentially because in the match and in practice it's sort of different movement, can potentially hurt you. It can hurt your groins or shoulder or knees or back and so forth. So I'm not saying it's the toughest sport around, but it's definitely one of the most demanding one in terms of scheduling and the differences of the conditions that we play in.	292_4.a	2015-02-24	M	292	Vasek Pospisil	Novak Djokovic	I don't know whether you are not feeling great. You sound a bit sort of croaky. Have you found the conditions a bit challenging this year?	292_4.q	1.0	1	1st Round	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP500
292_5	I didn't have any special celebration for 40th or 30th, but I think as 50th is something unique, so I'll you know, I'm not sure. It's early to talk about the title here. The tournament just started. Hopefully can happen here, and if it does, then we will make it count.	292_5.a	2015-02-24	M	292	Vasek Pospisil	Novak Djokovic	You could win your 50th career title here. Are you a guy who focuses on these milestones? Will you have a very special celebration?	292_5.q	1.0	1	1st Round	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP500
292_6	I know. I received that information few days ago, and that's why I have a motivation more this week (laughter).	292_6.a	2015-02-24	M	292	Vasek Pospisil	Novak Djokovic	You will also go one more than your coach.	292_6.q	1.0	1	1st Round	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP500
4584_0	Well, what I was thinking about was probably the match still. Wasn't so much about the last time. Not at all actually. I didn't really think about that. It was just, you know, I just had the feeling that there was absolutely nothing I could have done today to have won that match. You know, I just felt, like, my opponent was better on every level. You know, that's all I was thinking about.	4584_0.a	2012-07-02	F	4584	Angelique Kerber	Kim Clijsters	When you walked off the court today knowing it was going to be your last time here at Wimbledon, what was going through your mind and your heart?	4584_0.q	47.0	0	4th Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4584_1	Right now? I don't know. I haven't thought about it properly.	4584_1.a	2012-07-02	F	4584	Angelique Kerber	Kim Clijsters	As you do think about it now, what are your thoughts?	4584_1.q	47.0	0	4th Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4584_2	I won't be sorry about anything. I mean, I know that every time that I've played here I've given my best, and that's the only thing that I can try. You know, some days it's good, some days it's great, and some days it's not good enough. And that's something that I'll never regret. I'll never say that I didn't work hard enough or I didn't practice hard enough. So I don't think I'll feel sorry about anything when I leave.	4584_2.a	2012-07-02	F	4584	Angelique Kerber	Kim Clijsters	What do you think you'll be sorriest to leave behind knowing this is your last Wimbledon?	4584_2.q	47.0	0	4th Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4584_3	I don't think about myself in that way at all. I just try to be myself. You know, I have good friends on tour, and that's what's important to me. I don't think, you know, about what impact I have. I don't look at myself in that way at all.	4584_3.a	2012-07-02	F	4584	Angelique Kerber	Kim Clijsters	What gives you the most satisfaction in terms of the impact you've had on the tour and on the players?	4584_3.q	47.0	0	4th Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4584_4	Yeah, sure. It obviously all started I think from when I was a youngster, being at home even before I was a junior watching Wimbledon during summer holidays from Belgium, watching it on TV. You just kind of felt the magic coming through the television, I think. So that was kind of my first connection with Wimbledon. And then as I got older, when I was able to be here for the first time as a junior, it was just very special. I mean, I think the first year that I played here, I was here just to take it all in. I don't even think I was here to play tennis. I needed to just open my eyes and look at everything. It's so new. It was such, you know, an amazing thing. It was like to me this was like Disneyland to another child. So it was such a beautiful thing. So, yeah, I think the next year or the year after I was able to make the finals here in juniors, and that was a very special moment. I was able to go to the championship ball. Won doubles here. So I have a lot of good memories, a lot of special memories also emotionally with my family and my with my dad. Yeah, it's a nice place to go back to every year.	4584_4.a	2012-07-02	F	4584	Angelique Kerber	Kim Clijsters	This is such a wonderful event in our sport. It's hard to ask, but if you could put a couple of favorite memories about this event.	4584_4.q	47.0	0	4th Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4584_5	I mean, there is a funny one that I think kind of he wouldn't probably come to all my matches. I think he was here for three or four days, and I don't think he saw me play for one minute because it rained for three days in a row. He sat on the side of the courts on the wooden benches. He sat in the rain and waited for the ballkids or the groundsmen to take the covers off because he wanted that seat because he thought that would bring me luck. So he just sat on that seat. The next day again he rushed over to that seat. So that's with him one of the funny ones that I have. Playing Steffi here was for me definitely one of my dreams come true as a young upandcoming player. To be playing Steffi in her last Wimbledon was very, very special.	4584_5.a	2012-07-02	F	4584	Angelique Kerber	Kim Clijsters	Any special memories with your father here?	4584_5.q	47.0	0	4th Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4584_6	It's kind of hard. I think you need to individualize. If I would do that  and it's something that I, you know, probably have been thinking more of in the last few months it's something that I would like to maybe do in the future. But it's hard to kind of just say, Okay, this, this and this. I think it needs to be very individual. I think there's not one advice or one tip that works, you know, for a whole bunch of kids. Everybody's different. Having been around for the second week of Grand Slams, I've been able to see some of the juniors and met some of the juniors. It's a lot different I think than when I was playing juniors. But in a way, yeah, I think for me, you know, I had learned so much from, let's say Sabine Appelmans, when I was able to practice with her. You know, if I can help a junior in any way to share my experience and my knowledge, you know, about anything, any questions, I mean, I would be very happy to help out.	4584_6.a	2012-07-02	F	4584	Angelique Kerber	Kim Clijsters	If you had the opportunity to mentor young girls in the future, what would you be telling them are the important qualities both on and off the court to make it successfully on the tournament?	4584_6.q	47.0	0	4th Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4584_7	What I've noticed is that I've probably explained more to my daughter, as where in the past I was just like, you know, if she wanted to I mean, I did my stuff on court or at the courts, and then whatever she felt like doing little trips here and there. But now I've noticed that I explain to her more about tennis on the road, especially here about Wimbledon, too, about the history a little bit. I've caught myself like explaining to her, yeah, little details that I remember from when I was a child. I tell her those things, and it's fun in a way to pass those things on.	4584_7.a	2012-07-02	F	4584	Angelique Kerber	Kim Clijsters	In the next two months, how much do you think your power of observation, the little things that have made you happy, will be increased? What will you do to savor all the moments over the summer that's ahead?	4584_7.q	47.0	0	4th Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4584_8	The way that she played today, you know, obviously this is the first time I ever played against her, but she played incredible. I think she played close to the perfect match. Like I said, I never had a chance to get into the match or where she kind of dropped her level a little bit. She was on every level just too good: served better, returned better, and just in the rallies was hitting the ball very deep, very fast onto the bounce, anticipating really good as well. It was too good. So I look forward to just watching her here obviously the rest of this tournament and just seeing her in the future, how she does against different players.	4584_8.a	2012-07-02	F	4584	Angelique Kerber	Kim Clijsters	What were your thoughts on the person who beat you today and her future in this tournament?	4584_8.q	47.0	0	4th Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4584_9	There will be a different vibe to that match, two Germans playing each other. I definitely think she's a better mover than Lisicki. Lisicki has a great serve, has a very good kind of first shot. She likes to hit that 12 shot, a good serve, then open up the court with the serve and really hits aggressive. I think Kerber is more of an allaround player, plays really well, anticipates really well, but is a great mover. And I think on grass, you know, yeah, it will be close. Then the whole German situation I think will probably have an effect, too.	4584_9.a	2012-07-02	F	4584	Angelique Kerber	Kim Clijsters	She plays Lisicki next. What do you make of that match?	4584_9.q	47.0	0	4th Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4584_10	No, he had to go home. He didn't see me play.	4584_10.a	2012-07-02	F	4584	Angelique Kerber	Kim Clijsters	What was the punchline to the story you were telling about your dad sitting there?	4584_10.q	47.0	0	4th Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4584_11	No, no. Once in a while like when we get a picture sent to sign to our house. I show her and she's like, Oh, mommy, you won the trophy. No, I don't have pictures of trophies or trophies up in our house. No.	4584_11.a	2012-07-02	F	4584	Angelique Kerber	Kim Clijsters	Obviously that image of your daughter in New York is a great image. Is she aware of that, or have you talked to her about that?	4584_11.q	47.0	0	4th Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4584_12	Yeah, I do think that she, maybe through me obviously and through everybody, even my husband, you feel that it's different here. So I think in that way she does feel that it's a little bit more special I think because it means a lot to us, as well. On the other hand, she's also older again, so it's probably easier for her to understand.	4584_12.a	2012-07-02	F	4584	Angelique Kerber	Kim Clijsters	Does she have any sense how special Wimbledon is?	4584_12.q	47.0	0	4th Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
761_0	One year makes a big difference.  And I think I'm older now.  I think I'm more mature.  I don't know, I just am improving and getting better and better, and that's the biggest difference.	761_0.a	2007-01-15	F	761	Aleksandra Wozniak	Jelena Jankovic	Jelena Jankovic last year and Jelena Jankovic this year are different.  What's the difference?	761_0.q	11.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
761_1	Yes, I think my coach is helping me, and I'm also here with my sparring partner.  It's going really well, and I'm really enjoying my game and playing well.	761_1.a	2007-01-15	F	761	Aleksandra Wozniak	Jelena Jankovic	Big help from your coach now?	761_1.q	11.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
761_2	Yeah, she was a good player, but it's always tough for me the first round because you never know how you'll play.  It's another tournament.  I played so much in the last couple of weeks.  I had 10 matches in 11 days and didn't have much rest.  But I'm happy that I won today and that -- I hope to keep going.	761_2.a	2007-01-15	F	761	Aleksandra Wozniak	Jelena Jankovic	Your opponent today, the Canadian girl, looked good?	761_2.q	11.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
761_3	Yeah, I'm a little bit tired and I felt a little bit slow on the court.  I didn't feel so fresh and so -- I didn't have good energy, but I tried my best, and I'm happy to I won.	761_3.a	2007-01-15	F	761	Aleksandra Wozniak	Jelena Jankovic	And you feel well?	761_3.q	11.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
761_4	Just try to rest as much as possible, and I'll have a like a light hit and a massage and just try to recover my body the best as possible because I had so many tough matches in the last couple of weeks, and it was just so tough on my body.  I need to recover well in order to play well. So I'm trying.  I will just play a little bit tomorrow and try to rest as much as I can.	761_4.a	2007-01-15	F	761	Aleksandra Wozniak	Jelena Jankovic	How do you try to freshen yourself up when you get a day off tomorrow?  What do you do to try to regain some energy?	761_4.q	11.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
761_5	Yeah, I think I believe more in myself.  I know I can compete with the best players and beat them, and hopefully I will join them soon in the rankings because now I'm 11 in the world.  And if I won last week I would have been in the top ten, so that's my goal:  To go in the top ten. My goal is just to get better and better, just to keep improving, and I think nothing is perfect .  You can always get better, and that's my goal, just to get better than I am today.  That's my goal.  Tomorrow I want to be better than I am today.  That's just my goal.	761_5.a	2007-01-15	F	761	Aleksandra Wozniak	Jelena Jankovic	What did you tell yourself after the end of last season to get yourself motivated for this year?  Did you say, Yeah, now I've really turned the corner and I belong with the other players?	761_5.q	11.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
761_6	No, I was playing, and I heard that there was some fights.  But like I said, here in Melbourne it's a little bit strange because I think it's just a sport and people should just come and enjoy the game. It's not about where you're from or -- you either like the player and you'll cheer for them, but you don't have to cheer against them just because they are from some country, and I think that's wrong.	761_6.a	2007-01-15	F	761	Aleksandra Wozniak	Jelena Jankovic	Did you hear about all the fans being thrown out today, the Serbians?	761_6.q	11.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
761_7	I don't know, but I had such a big crowd in New Zealand, in Sydney.  It was just a great atmosphere to play in front of such a crowd when they're cheering.  I think this kind of atmosphere motivates both of the players to show their best tennis, and it's, I think, a lot more fun to watch. But I don't like when they are fighting against each other and kind of booing the other player just because they are from some other country.  I think that's not fair, so that's just my opinion.	761_7.a	2007-01-15	F	761	Aleksandra Wozniak	Jelena Jankovic	Do you think it's more football fans who have gravitated towards tennis because you have players from their countries now?	761_7.q	11.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
761_8	Yeah.  I think the game should just be fair and they should clap for good points and support the player they like, but they shouldn't be really mean and really bad and fight against the other just to make the other one feel bad.	761_8.a	2007-01-15	F	761	Aleksandra Wozniak	Jelena Jankovic	It's hard on the other player if they're booing double faults?	761_8.q	11.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
761_9	Yes, I heard it will be quite tough.  You know, I just hope from will be no fights.  I hope that it will go in a peaceful way.  Because I think just here in Melbourne that there is this kind of problems.  Anywhere else in the world it's fine. When you play a Croatian girl or when there's matches, Serbian and Croatian, it's fine.  But here it's just -- I don't know what it is.	761_9.a	2007-01-15	F	761	Aleksandra Wozniak	Jelena Jankovic	A Serb is actually playing a Croat tomorrow in the men's draw.	761_9.q	11.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
761_10	No, the crowd for me was really great.  I had so many -- the stadium was quite full.  I think full completely, and I had so many Serbian fans and the other fans, as well, and they're just cheering.  It's fun to play in such atmosphere.	761_10.a	2007-01-15	F	761	Aleksandra Wozniak	Jelena Jankovic	How did you find the crowd atmosphere in your game?	761_10.q	11.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
899_0	No, I don't think my hands was a factor.  I think he was just playing steady.  He hit a couple big forehands when he needed to.  But I think most of the time I kind of just gave him a few too many free points off his second serve.  I was trying to go for it a bit more. I had like three breakpoints where I hit the same return long, backhand return long.  I think just the bigger points I wasn't really able to convert them as well. I was up a break twice in the second set, and he was able to break me back both times right after.  In the tiebreak, I was up 3-Love, 4-2, something like that.  You know, I just kind of gave him a few too many points when I was up.	899_0.a	2007-08-06	M	899	Fabio Fognini	Peter Polansky	Do you think he was just a little bit better than you or were there other factors, like your hand, stuff like that?	899_0.q	326.0	0	1st Round	ROGERS MASTERS	Masters
899_1	Yeah.	899_1.a	2007-08-06	M	899	Fabio Fognini	Peter Polansky	On the set point, you missed one of those backhand returns.	899_1.q	326.0	0	1st Round	ROGERS MASTERS	Masters
899_2	You know, I don't know.  Just kind of got up on me a little bit.  I just tried to step in a little bit, caught it a bit late.	899_2.a	2007-08-06	M	899	Fabio Fognini	Peter Polansky	Do you think it was because you were going for too much; he hit a good serve?	899_2.q	326.0	0	1st Round	ROGERS MASTERS	Masters
899_3	On one of my serves in the beginning of the tiebreak, I noticed that when I landed, my calf cramped for a split second.  I was trying to be careful with it.  Then on the approach forehand, when I pushed off, it cramped right on that one.  That's when I kind of knew -- that's when it felt a lot worse, on that one. On the serve, it was tough to push off, so I double-faulted the next point, then I missed that return.	899_3.a	2007-08-06	M	899	Fabio Fognini	Peter Polansky	Towards the end, you seemed to have a cramp in your leg.	899_3.q	326.0	0	1st Round	ROGERS MASTERS	Masters
899_4	Yeah, I mean, you know, right now there's so many things I just wish I could be out there again.  You know, I mean, I just think it was a great experience anyways.  I mean, playing in front of a crowd like this, big tournament like this.  Even though, you know, I knew I could have won today maybe, I know I can compete with these guys. I'm not really out here just kind of trying to, you know, just -- I'm not really just happy to be here.  You know, I actually believe this year, you know, I could have won a couple of rounds if I was playing well. I think everything, this whole thing, has been a learning experience.  It's been great this whole tournament.  I know he was a qualifier.  He's played a couple matches before me, but his ranking was, you know, still 130.  He wasn't one of the higher-ranked guys, but his level is there. It was just an all-around good experience, I think.	899_4.a	2007-08-06	M	899	Fabio Fognini	Peter Polansky	They talk about learning from losses and stuff like that.  What did you learn today?  Can you tell right after a match or is it something you have to think about?	899_4.q	326.0	0	1st Round	ROGERS MASTERS	Masters
899_5	Three days ago I had a blister out of nowhere.  It got better.  But I tried playing with the tape off today.  Near the end of the first set, the blister kind of opened again.  I just got it taped up again.  It wasn't too much of a problem.	899_5.a	2007-08-06	M	899	Fabio Fognini	Peter Polansky	What happened to your hand in the first set?	899_5.q	326.0	0	1st Round	ROGERS MASTERS	Masters
899_6	A little bit, but it's okay (smiling).	899_6.a	2007-08-06	M	899	Fabio Fognini	Peter Polansky	Some bad luck?	899_6.q	326.0	0	1st Round	ROGERS MASTERS	Masters
899_7	I'm just going to take a few weeks off now at home, just rest up and get some fitness done.  I mean, I've been on the road, this is my seventh week in a row.  It's been quite a while since I've been home.  You know, just go home, relax a bit. I'll be playing some challengers again in the States I think in September.	899_7.a	2007-08-06	M	899	Fabio Fognini	Peter Polansky	Where do you go from here?	899_7.q	326.0	0	1st Round	ROGERS MASTERS	Masters
899_8	Well, when I was in Italy, it was all on clay.  You know, I got back and had to go straight to Granby, which is really fast courts.  You know, I don't really feel too worn down.  I mean, it's a little bit tough mentally playing seven weeks in a row, even though I've been feeling great.  I just think, you know, why play eight in a row.  I just thought I'd take some time off. I don't think I was really worn down from it all.  It was all right.	899_8.a	2007-08-06	M	899	Fabio Fognini	Peter Polansky	Do you feel like you're a little worn down, seven straight weeks?	899_8.q	326.0	0	1st Round	ROGERS MASTERS	Masters
899_9	I think so far this year I've been doing really well.  I just started playing more and more challengers these last couple months, been able to qualify for more, winning some rounds now. So, you know, I think my progress, so far I've been doing great.  I know now if I go play challengers, most of guys in the draw I know I can win on any day.  I know they're good players, I won't win them all, but I just believe that I can beat them now.	899_9.a	2007-08-06	M	899	Fabio Fognini	Peter Polansky	How would you sum up your progress so far this year?	899_9.q	326.0	0	1st Round	ROGERS MASTERS	Masters
899_10	Yeah.  Some of them in the States are a little bit tough.  I think my ranking is like 320, 330 now.  I should be able to get into main draw in some of them, maybe be one of the top speeds in quallies if I have to.	899_10.a	2007-08-06	M	899	Fabio Fognini	Peter Polansky	You'll be able to get into a few challengers without qualifying.  Will that make it a little easier?	899_10.q	326.0	0	1st Round	ROGERS MASTERS	Masters
6228_0	I mean, I guess you could say that, yeah. I mean, there was a lot of incredibly long rallies and long games and stuff after that. I mean, he literally barely missed a ball for about a set and a half. Yeah, I couldn't find a way around him. He played just great tennis, especially the last set and a half. The beginning of the second set I still had a couple of opportunities there right at the beginning. But after that, I've got to give it to him, he played fantastically well and deserved to win.	6228_0.a	2014-10-09	M	6228	David Ferrer	Andy Murray	That one break of serve seemed to change the momentum of the entire match. Was that how you saw it?	6228_0.q	11.0	0	3rd Round	SHANGHAI ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
6228_1	It's tough to say. I played him on many different courts, different surfaces. But I know today that he played really, really, really well. I mean, you expect that. He's been one of the top five, six players in the world for a very long time. But I was still hitting the ball pretty clean and making him do a lot of running, making him come up with some very tough shots. He just didn't miss. Even when I had him on the run or in tough positions, he just came up with really good stuff. It was a shame for me, but it was great for him.	6228_1.a	2014-10-09	M	6228	David Ferrer	Andy Murray	Do you feel that's possibly the best he's played against you, that last set and a half?	6228_1.q	11.0	0	3rd Round	SHANGHAI ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
6228_2	Always when you lose, it stings. You wish you could have done a little bit better. I mean, I maybe could have tried to move forward a little bit more when I had him on the run. Even in the last game, tried to come forward a couple of times. It's tough. He came up with a couple of good passing shots, as well. I didn't play as well up at the net today as I had been since I was here in Asia. That was maybe why I was slightly reluctant in the third set to come forward as much. But even still, when you come forward, he's making you play incredibly difficult shots or passing you. It's normal to not keep moving forward as much.	6228_2.a	2014-10-09	M	6228	David Ferrer	Andy Murray	Looking at the match, do you chalk this up as a good day for David or was there more you thought you could do?	6228_2.q	11.0	0	3rd Round	SHANGHAI ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
6228_3	There's still obviously a few more weeks left in the season. I've played some pretty good tennis. I mean, the first set today was great tennis. I played great tennis. I played some really good stuff against Cilic last week. It was a solid match. I didn't necessarily play my best in Shenzhen, but managed to win the tournament there. I played some decent stuff, to be honest. Just, yeah, today was one that I felt like I was playing well enough to win the match, but he was exceptional today. Like I say, he deserved to win. I will go back maybe tonight or tomorrow and take a couple days off, see what the plan is for the next few weeks.	6228_3.a	2014-10-09	M	6228	David Ferrer	Andy Murray	What is your take away over the last few weeks in Asia? How do you think you can build on this run going into the next season, into Australia?	6228_3.q	11.0	0	3rd Round	SHANGHAI ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
6228_4	I'm definitely going to play that week. That was always the plan. I didn't know which one I was going to play. I spoke about that the last few weeks. But I was always planning on playing that week. But, yeah, we'll see over the next few days where I decide to go. Yeah, hopefully I can play well the last couple of tournaments, try and make a push for London.	6228_4.a	2014-10-09	M	6228	David Ferrer	Andy Murray	I take that to mean you might be contemplating Valencia, Basel?	6228_4.q	11.0	0	3rd Round	SHANGHAI ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
6101_0	Ah, okay. Umm, yeah, I'm pretty happy I got through. It was a really tough match. That's all I can say (smiling).	6101_0.a	2014-05-31	F	6101	Kristina Mladenovic	Andrea Petkovic	First time in the second week of a slam since 2011. How does it feel?	6101_0.q	27.0	1	3rd Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6101_1	I feel very bad, I have to say. I feel awful. But I just tried to hang in there, you know. It's a Grand Slam. I just tried to I just told myself, Listen, just shut up and play and try your best. Maybe you're gonna be the winner. I don't know, but just try your best. That's all I could do. Maybe it was a good thing, because I didn't realize the public. I didn't realize anything. I was just sort of, yeah, occupied with myself and my body. Yeah, now, I think I need some time to just settle in, because it was a lot of stuff going on.	6101_1.a	2014-05-31	F	6101	Kristina Mladenovic	Andrea Petkovic	How did you feel physically? Because the doctor went. How do you feel?	6101_1.q	27.0	1	3rd Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6101_2	I'm having a virus since yesterday, a stomach virus. So I have made great friends with the bathroom the past day and night and today. So, yeah, I was just drained. My energy level, it was below zero, I think.	6101_2.a	2014-05-31	F	6101	Kristina Mladenovic	Andrea Petkovic	What was bothering you?	6101_2.q	27.0	1	3rd Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6101_3	Yeah, yeah. Well, you know, sometimes I think it helps also because I had no emotions whatsoever. Normally, you know, I'm a very emotional player. I just didn't realize what was going on at all. I was just sort of playing. The only thing I realized was that I was playing terrible and that I was moving awful. But I just, as I said, I just tried to focus. The thing was when I needed to, I raised my level kind of, and I just played a little better at the important moments. Yeah, and, you know, sometimes you need to be lucky as well.	6101_3.a	2014-05-31	F	6101	Kristina Mladenovic	Andrea Petkovic	Obviously you're feeling terrible. Do you feel more pride surviving, given those circumstances?	6101_3.q	27.0	1	3rd Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6101_4	Yeah, also, because I respect all the players, but I really like Kiki, we have been friends for years. You know, as I said, I just didn't have any emotions. I was just drained energywise, emotionswise. I just I was just surviving. I wasn't playing. I was just surviving. So I didn't even realize I won. Really, it was so weird. So I'm really sorry. It was the weirdest match for me I have ever played.	6101_4.a	2014-05-31	F	6101	Kristina Mladenovic	Andrea Petkovic	Is that why your celebration was a little bit muted in the end? It wasn't big. Was it because you weren't feeling great? Are you good friends?	6101_4.q	27.0	1	3rd Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6101_5	Well, today the thing was that was always coming up, Why do I feel so bad? Why am I not moving better? Try it. Then I was trying and then after long rallies I felt bad again. So that was the only thing that kept going through my mind, Why do I have to feel bad now? You're playing on Philippe Chatrier, it's such a nice atmosphere, the crowd is really into it. Just try and get into this match already. Just try to get some emotions going. And I just couldn't. That was the thing that actually annoyed me most, that I couldn't get into the match emotionally. Because it was a beautiful atmosphere, and I was just sort of like a zombie there. Then when I realized I didn't have a lot of energy, I just told myself, Okay, as I said, just shut up, don't think and try the best you can with all that you have today. Just run for each ball as good as you can. Hit the balls as good as you can and try to jump on your serve. That's all I could do. As I said, in the important moments I was able to raise my level by pure willpower, I guess. I was really lucky I got through in the end.	6101_5.a	2014-05-31	F	6101	Kristina Mladenovic	Andrea Petkovic	You said at one point you said to yourself, Oh, just shut up. Tennis players are out there for hours just with themselves. Must have an incredible inner dialogue just going on. Talk about your own inner dialogue. Sometimes does it get way out of hand where there are some funny moments with that?	6101_5.q	27.0	1	3rd Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6101_6	Well, you know, I have learned to listen to my body more, obviously. I knew, you know, it's a virus, it's going to be gone tomorrow, it's two days, and it's nothing that's going to end my career. But it could have ended my tournament today. So I was pissed at it, you know. Because I wanted to play well and I wanted to play better first time on Chatrier. And I just wasn't able to physically. So I was just annoyed by all the circumstances. And then, you know what helped also? I just told myself, I sort of pushed back that it could have gone for three hours more, because there is no tiebreak. I just sort of said, Listen, you just have to survive. Just 15 minutes more, just 15 minutes more, and then just 10 minutes more, 10 minutes more. And, yeah, as I said, I just survived the match. That's all.	6101_6.a	2014-05-31	F	6101	Kristina Mladenovic	Andrea Petkovic	Is it because you had so many injuries that you said, Okay, that's not your problem today for me?	6101_6.q	27.0	1	3rd Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6101_7	Pressure? I don't feel any pressure. I haven't ever played her. I don't know anything about her. I have never even practiced with her. So I really don't know anything. So I really have to do some catching up now maybe with some videos and just get to know her as a player. Obviously she has nothing to lose. She played some tremendous matches to have come so far. So I'm well aware that I have to be on my top and the first thing I have to get physically ready again. I think this tournament and other tournaments as well, but this tournament especially showed that if you're not on top, even if you are a Grand Slam champion or the No.1 in the world, those girls are going to beat you nowadays. You just have to be on your toes all the time. Everyone is playing super well. I don't feel any pressure. The only pressure I feel is try to play well and do my best and get the best out of it.	6101_7.a	2014-05-31	F	6101	Kristina Mladenovic	Andrea Petkovic	You get Kiki Bertens next as a qualifier. Being in the second week obviously is a big opportunity. I know every player who has gotten there is playing well. But probably as a seed against a qualifier you feel more pressure.	6101_7.q	27.0	1	3rd Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6101_8	Yeah, yeah, it's been really nice. As I said, I have been having good results after my comebacks, but I was lacking the results at the Grand Slams. I was playing bad at the Grand Slams. So now it's nice to be back at the big stages again. It's just what we all dream about and what we all work for. So it's just, you know, it's just also a confirmation for having stuck to my comeback and sort of pushing through the hard times. And actually, one year ago I wanted to stop with tennis because I was awful. I'm here in the fourth round, which is kind of nice. I'm just happy I stuck with my comeback, and I kept trying. Yeah.	6101_8.a	2014-05-31	F	6101	Kristina Mladenovic	Andrea Petkovic	Despite your physical condition, obviously you have been coming back, having some better and better results. Is this kind of a confirmation to get this far at a major tournament like this that you are really back?	6101_8.q	27.0	1	3rd Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6101_9	Always the Grand Slams are a place of highs and lows for me. That's the nice thing about it.	6101_9.a	2014-05-31	F	6101	Kristina Mladenovic	Andrea Petkovic	This is a place of highs and lows for you.	6101_9.q	27.0	1	3rd Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
3911_0	Yes. I think for be my first match since 2009 on grass, it's okay. I can play better. I need to improve many things if I want to still alive in the tournament. But for start, is a nice match.	3911_0.a	2011-06-21	M	3911	nan	Juan Martin Del Potro	Are you satisfied with your game today, and is there more to come?	3911_0.q	21.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3911_1	Yes. He's very fast. He made many slices, dropshots. I'm not top player, so sometimes is going to be difficult. But I served really well today, and I feel confidence with my game.	3911_1.a	2011-06-21	M	3911	nan	Juan Martin Del Potro	Was it tough or...	3911_1.q	21.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3911_2	Really nice. I miss all the tournaments. This one is one of the best of the world. And I came here many days before for be ready for this tournament, trying to learn on grass. Need to improve my volley, my serve, everything. If not this year, maybe the next one. But I'm trying.	3911_2.a	2011-06-21	M	3911	nan	Juan Martin Del Potro	How does it feel being back at Wimbledon after the two-year gap?	3911_2.q	21.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3911_3	No, no, no. We are professional. Here in London, everything with the weather can happen. But we want to play in every way in every surface, and we are here for that.	3911_3.a	2011-06-21	M	3911	nan	Juan Martin Del Potro	Did the rain break disrupt you a lot yesterday?	3911_3.q	21.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3911_4	Today? You think so?	3911_4.a	2011-06-21	M	3911	nan	Juan Martin Del Potro	Is it fair to say that you looked a bit nervous today?	3911_4.q	21.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3911_5	Maybe. Maybe, because he's very dangerous. But I was focused with my serve. Here on grass, if you have a good serve, take your chance, you have many opportunities to win.	3911_5.a	2011-06-21	M	3911	nan	Juan Martin Del Potro	Yes, I think so.	3911_5.q	21.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1889_0	I actually thought I started well. I went up 4-1, you know, was playing solid, but against someone who has his sort of game style, you know, there's going to be points in the match where he's hitting a lot of winners and dictating what's happening on the court because, you know, he plays ultra-aggressive, and has done every time I played against him. He got back into the first set. But, you know, after that I thought I hit the ball really, really well. I took a lot of my chances. I made him do a lot of running and was very confident from the second set onwards.	1889_0.a	2009-01-24	M	1889	Jurgen Melzer	Andy Murray	A slow start, but then you got into almost overdrive. How would you sum up the game?	1889_0.q	4.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1889_1	I mean, the conditions on the court today were very different to what they were the first match that I played. I've been practicing during the day, as well. The ball flies a lot. It tends to be more windy, as well, during the day. On that court, I felt like, you know, tonight you could really swing hard at the ball, and it was pretty heavy conditions. When I played him in the past, he struggled to return his serve. But, you know, he didn't get too many free points off that. Once I got a feeling for the court, like I said, I felt like I could swing really hard at the ball, you know. From early in the second set, I was dictating everything that was happening.	1889_1.a	2009-01-24	M	1889	Jurgen Melzer	Andy Murray	That point, once you held serve early in the second, it seemed like you got really aggressive very quickly. Was that a deliberate thing or was that just the way the match happened to turn?	1889_1.q	4.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1889_2	No, not nerves. If you saw the points, he like swung for three, four games in a row. He was going for huge shots. You know, he made them. He's one of those guys that, when he's behind, he's dangerous because he doesn't think a whole lot. I think when it starts to get close against him and he starts thinking is when he starts to make more mistakes, like at the end of the first set. But, yeah, I wasn't particularly nervous because I knew I was playing well. Even if I had lost the next break, I would have felt confident winning the match.	1889_2.a	2009-01-24	M	1889	Jurgen Melzer	Andy Murray	At the end, was that him hitting out or were there a few nerves?	1889_2.q	4.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1889_3	Well, I mean, like I said, with the serving, I felt like I returned his serve much, much better than I had done in the past. The conditions were slower, which helped me, because he plays very aggressive. He likes to come into the net, take the ball early, sort of rush you. But with the heavy conditions, I wasn't as rushed, and returned the serve better. I mean, I just felt more confident going into the match. I knew if I played well, and the first set was very important, I felt like I could go on to win in three sets if I grabbed the first set. But when he gets ahead, you know, he can start serving well and he can get confident. The start was very important. But I do think I played much better today than at the US Open.	1889_3.a	2009-01-24	M	1889	Jurgen Melzer	Andy Murray	Would you say, Andy, the way you won today, compared with the match at the US Open, would you see that as a measure of how much you've improved since then or did you feel he didn't play as well as he did then?	1889_3.q	4.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1889_4	Just very different matches. I mean, you know, I had a tough start at the US Open. I mean, Llodra is a very tricky player, played well against me. Melzer, obviously I played much better this time. I think I've started here better than I did at the US Open. But, you know, you got to do the same next week, as well.	1889_4.a	2009-01-24	M	1889	Jurgen Melzer	Andy Murray	Can you compare the start you've had here with the US Open, how it feels to you?	1889_4.q	4.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1889_5	Haven't really seen a whole lot of his match. I think Stepanek, I don't know if he had something wrong with him today or not, but he didn't look like he was particularly interested. I mean, against Verdasco, it's very important to use my head. I have a very good record against left-handers. The only one I've lost to on the tour has been Nadal. I need to use my head, make him do a lot of thinking and moving. If I play like I did tonight, I can definitely win that one.	1889_5.a	2009-01-24	M	1889	Jurgen Melzer	Andy Murray	You've had a good run against Verdasco in the past. What have you made of him so far?	1889_5.q	4.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1889_6	Yeah, it was good. I heard someone say they didn't do night sessions on that court beforehand. I don't know if it's just people that turn up and buy tickets that they get in or not. It was, yeah, a very good atmosphere. They were chanting from the first point to the last. Obviously makes a difference when you're playing away from home and you've got great support.	1889_6.a	2009-01-24	M	1889	Jurgen Melzer	Andy Murray	Lively atmosphere in there tonight, lots of Scots.	1889_6.q	4.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1889_7	I mean, I think you need to just sort of settle yourself down before the start of the second week 'cause there's a lot of tennis to be played. The matches are obviously going to get tougher. Verdasco has been playing well so far in the tournament. You know, I'm sure one match in a slam, if you want to go deep, maybe you're not playing your best tennis, you have to try and find a way through to win. I hope it doesn't happen, but if it does, I need to be prepared to try and win a match when I'm not playing my best tennis.	1889_7.a	2009-01-24	M	1889	Jurgen Melzer	Andy Murray	You said you had very good preparation for this. Now you seem to be coming into form. Do you think you're gaining momentum as the tournament goes on?	1889_7.q	4.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1889_8	Yeah, well, Melzer is a test obviously for me. I've had close matches with him in the past. It was a good test to see where my game was at. I was very happy.	1889_8.a	2009-01-24	M	1889	Jurgen Melzer	Andy Murray	Do you think you've been tested enough up to this point for the second week?	1889_8.q	4.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
6461_0	Yeah, especially first two sets. Was a great start. Obviously first official match on a grass court season this year. Coming into Wimbledon with no official matches, it always gives you an extra reason to get that commitment and focus from the start and try to play as best as you can. So that's what I did. Very, very pleased with my performance overall today. You know, in the third, credit to him coming back, playing some good points. But generally it was the match that I had control over, and just happy with the performance.	6461_0.a	2014-06-23	M	6461	Andrey Golubev	Novak Djokovic	You couldn't have started off any quicker than you did. That was dream tennis for the first two sets.	6461_0.q	2.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6461_1	Well, I mean, last year's final was a historical final obviously for Andy and Great Britain. He deserved to win because in the important moments he was the better player. Yes, I haven't played the way I wanted to play or maybe the way I played throughout the tournament. But, you know, he rise up to the occasion. For him it was second or third Wimbledon final, so many expectations, of course pressure to be the first British man to win a Wimbledon title after many years. I've had couple of opportunities in the second and the third set, but generally, you know, he was the more stable player and he deserved to win the title.	6461_1.a	2014-06-23	M	6461	Andrey Golubev	Novak Djokovic	Because of the history, a lot has been written about Andy's 2013 final, not so much about yours. You arguably didn't play your best tennis. Did you want to remind Centre Court what you can do today?	6461_1.q	2.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6461_2	Obviously, going back to the Centre Court of Wimbledon, which is probably most special center court in the world, is always a privilege, is always a pleasure. As I said, because of the fact that I haven't had any official grass court match this year, and also because it's the Centre Court of Wimbledon, of course you want to perform well, you know, and win your matches comfortably.	6461_2.a	2014-06-23	M	6461	Andrey Golubev	Novak Djokovic	But the way you played today suggested...	6461_2.q	2.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6461_3	It's not the first time I have this particular approach to the grass court season, because the last three years was more or less the same where I went far in Roland Garros, had a long clay court season which honestly takes a lot out of you emotionally, physically. So you need a little bit of time to recover. So for me and my team it's more important to take some time off, a few days, and skip the leadup tournament to Wimbledon and just recharge the batteries and come here earlier, practice, get on the court. From one perspective, it can be, you know, dangerous in a way because, I mean, you can play of course some big server in the beginning of the tournament and you can go out early. But it's not the first time, as I said. So the schedule is such that it doesn't allow the players that go that far in clay court Grand Slam in Roland Garros to have few days at least off and then practice and then have a tournament. But from next year I'm looking forward to have that extra week between Roland Garros and Wimbledon. It's going to give more time to whoever does well in Paris to prepare for Wimbledon and, of course, have another official tournament before that.	6461_3.a	2014-06-23	M	6461	Andrey Golubev	Novak Djokovic	How difficult was it for you, knowing that you didn't have any competitive games on grass before the tournament?	6461_3.q	2.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6461_4	It's a combination of feelings that go through my mind. Obviously playing so many years on a high level, coming back to this court, to this tournament, you know, you have the expectations. You're always kind of one of the favorites to go far in the event. You build up on those expectations. So sometimes you think about just winning the match, being comfortable on the court, just not spending too much time. Then again, as I mentioned before, Centre Court in Wimbledon is the most special center court we have in sport. You cannot not notice and just feel the present moment and the experience of being out there. You can feel the history and you can feel the tradition. That's something that is always present and obviously a feeling for a player.	6461_4.a	2014-06-23	M	6461	Andrey Golubev	Novak Djokovic	When you come to Wimbledon, is it more a matter of this is the world's biggest tournament, I have to focus on my matches, or is there a sense that this is the place I dreamed of when I was a kid?	6461_4.q	2.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6461_5	Well, last year I think semifinal I had against Rafa and lost I think 97 in the fifth set took maybe even more emotionally out of me. This year, again, it was a disappointing loss. Got a bit closer. But tennis is such sport that it requires from a player to just recover and come back to the court very quickly in a matter of a week or two, so you don't have much time to think about what's happened. You try to learn the lesson. You try to take that as a necessary experience and a lesson in life and move on. You know, it's not the first time I had this situation. That obvious experience, necessary experience, helps. I think maybe it's even better not to have too much time without an official match so for this thought of losing that final can stay longer. I think actually by winning this match today, by being on the Grand Slam, another big event, it helps me get over it quicker.	6461_5.a	2014-06-23	M	6461	Andrey Golubev	Novak Djokovic	Do you feel mentally you're over that final in Roland Garros?	6461_5.q	2.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6461_6	Yes, he has won against Andy in Queen's just a few weeks ago. You know, Radek is an experienced player. He's somebody that I know very well off the court, as well. We are good friends. We practice with each other a lot. We just actually practiced on Thursday before the event started. This win against Andy in Queen's must have given him a lot of confidence coming into Wimbledon. I always thought that his game is very good for this surface because he has a touch, he anticipates well, he comes to the net. He's one of the very few serveandvolley players nowadays, has this flat forehand. Very good game for this surface. We played here against each other I think two years ago. It was a fourset match. We'll see. I mean, it's not going to be easy definitely. But if I play the way I did today, I think I have a good chance.	6461_6.a	2014-06-23	M	6461	Andrey Golubev	Novak Djokovic	Your opponent today lost his last 10 grass court matches in a row. Your next opponent is very aggressive on grass. He's made it hard for a lot of top players this season.	6461_6.q	2.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6461_7	She played an incredibly important role in my development as a tennis player and my career in general. She rooted all the basic things of tennis, on the court, off the court, my behavior, my shots, my general approach to this sport. Because of her I just have this particular professionalism and dedication to the sport. She was an incredible woman. She was never married, so she put all her passion and love in life to tennis. Few weeks before she died, she was on the tennis court. So, yeah, I mean, I know how much she meant to me. You know, always keep her in my mind.	6461_7.a	2014-06-23	M	6461	Andrey Golubev	Novak Djokovic	Andy obviously did something pretty bold in the hiring of his new coach. Your first coach was Jelena. She was also kind of a life coach, introduced you to classical music, so forth. Do you think that she was a woman who in any way helped you start in your path?	6461_7.q	2.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6461_8	All the coaches that I had?	6461_8.a	2014-06-23	M	6461	Andrey Golubev	Novak Djokovic	Of all the people and the coaches that have touched your career, who has given you the most important piece of advice as a tennis player and what was it?	6461_8.q	2.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6461_9	I can't pick one, to be honest. I'm very grateful to have many knowledgeable and passionate people about tennis and about life in general around me throughout my career. Those times when Serbia was going through war and economical crisis and so forth, embargo, it was very difficult time for a tennis player to develop, to grow up in such an environment. I was fortunate, very fortunate, in those times to be surrounded with people like Jelena Gencic, who was breathing this sport in a way. She wanted to convey every possible advice and message to me that she had in her life from coaching Monica Seles, traveling with Ivanisevic. She was also in handball, so forth. People who really cared about the sport were around me. Of course, from my parents I learned some big life, I would say, steps, advices that helped me to grow into a strong character. All the experiences that I had in that way also shaped up everything around me in this stage.	6461_9.a	2014-06-23	M	6461	Andrey Golubev	Novak Djokovic	People in your life, coaches in your life.	6461_9.q	2.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6461_10	I've been having my offseasons in Dubai and Abu Dhabi for the last five, six years. I love spending time in that part of the world. Winning Dubai and Abu Dhabi also tournament many times in my career. It says enough about how I feel in general spending time there. I just feel like home really. People are very kind. I look forward going there and being part of a new concept, a new league that can change tennis in a way really. Now I know that Nadal and Murray are also a part of that. Hopefully it can have the success that was planned and was intended from the organizers. I think it's a great idea. A combination of world class tennis with entertainment, men's singles, women's singles, legends, mixed doubles, you have it all. You can only serve to promote as well the sport in this part of the world, which is a fastgrowing market. It has a lot of potential for tennis. This can definitely help.	6461_10.a	2014-06-23	M	6461	Andrey Golubev	Novak Djokovic	You've had a lot of success in UAE. How much are you looking forward to representing the new league? Now would you consider having your offseason in Dubai?	6461_10.q	2.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3660_0	Not a whole lot of it, to be honest. I think it certainly -- it kinda went through stages where both of us were in total control, and then it would flip around and the other person was. So I think the first three or four games or something I was really just trying to hang in there. I thought she came out absolutely playing great. And then I was able to kinda stay steady and then I was able to really bump it up and then take control and win that first set. So I think kinda a lot of the match was a bit like that.	3660_0.a	2011-10-29	F	3660	Petra Kvitova	Samantha Stosur	How much did you feel that that match was on your racquet?	3660_0.q	7.0	0	Semifinals	TEB BNP PARIBAS WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS	SEC
3660_1	In the last set?	3660_1.a	2011-10-29	F	3660	Petra Kvitova	Samantha Stosur	Then just three early breaks in all the sets, that was tough to overcome?	3660_1.q	7.0	0	Semifinals	TEB BNP PARIBAS WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS	SEC
3660_2	Yeah, I mean, it's definitely hard to come back from that against a player like Petra. I think that third set, obviously she got away to a really big lead, which is always gonna be hard to come back. But I got it back to, you know, within a couple of games. And then I think, you know, if I was able to get that first point on her last service game, you never know. You know, nerves, you start tightening up and you never know from there. But she played a great forehand down the line for a winner nearly on the line, and it was pretty much done.	3660_2.a	2011-10-29	F	3660	Petra Kvitova	Samantha Stosur	Well, in all three you were down a break pretty early.	3660_2.q	7.0	0	Semifinals	TEB BNP PARIBAS WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS	SEC
3660_3	Oh, absolutely. Yeah, this was definitely my best match against her so far. I guess that's pleasing. And at least I was able to come off the court knowing that I did everything I could. I think I got beaten by a player who played very well today. You know, I'm happy with the way I played. Obviously it's disappointing, but at least it's better to walk off feeling like this than any other way.	3660_3.a	2011-10-29	F	3660	Petra Kvitova	Samantha Stosur	Did you feel like you made some progress, at least? You won a set today. You got much closer than you have in the past.	3660_3.q	7.0	0	Semifinals	TEB BNP PARIBAS WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS	SEC
3660_4	Yeah. Obviously it's had the absolute biggest highs that a player could ever ask for in the US Open and really the whole month leading up to the US Open, and then with the final, finally finishing the way it did, is obviously the biggest, you know, highlight. Then start of the year didn't quite go so well. So it's definitely been a year where I definitely thought I could have done a lot better than I was for the first few months, and then I guess I proved to myself that I was able to do a lot better, and now finishing off here at the Champs has definitely been another really good week for me. So overall I'd have to say I'm very pleased with it.	3660_4.a	2011-10-29	F	3660	Petra Kvitova	Samantha Stosur	Could you assess your season now that it's done, please.	3660_4.q	7.0	0	Semifinals	TEB BNP PARIBAS WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS	SEC
3660_5	Yeah. I mean, certain left-handers can be very tricky, and, you know, I think someone like Petra, she'd be hard anyway regardless whether she's lefty or plays right-handed. But reading that serve, it's a little more difficult and just the fact that there's not as many left-handers out there. I guess that's what makes it the most tricky.	3660_5.a	2011-10-29	F	3660	Petra Kvitova	Samantha Stosur	Is it harder to play against a left-handed opponent for you?	3660_5.q	7.0	0	Semifinals	TEB BNP PARIBAS WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS	SEC
3660_6	Well, I head back home, take, you know, probably a good two, three weeks off and just kinda do whatever I want, and then I'll get stuck into the fitness training for 10 days to two weeks and maybe have the odd hit during that period. And then really from December really start focusing about being on the court and putting most of my energy into on the court rather than off the court. So, yeah, it's gonna be, I'm sure, very busy, because it's the part of the year that I always try and make sure I enjoy and really do whatever I need to do to get prepared for the year ahead.	3660_6.a	2011-10-29	F	3660	Petra Kvitova	Samantha Stosur	What's next for you, sort of the next couple of months?	3660_6.q	7.0	0	Semifinals	TEB BNP PARIBAS WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS	SEC
3660_7	No, it's funny. I already said cooling down in the gym, it was the same thing last year, I got to the Championships and felt like I started playing really well again, almost didn't want to stop. Now I it could probably say the same thing now, but obviously it's been a long year and you always look forward to that break. But certainly it's now makes you eager to do that training and get into the next year.	3660_7.a	2011-10-29	F	3660	Petra Kvitova	Samantha Stosur	With what's happening the last few months, would you almost want the season to continue or are you pretty much ready for that break?	3660_7.q	7.0	0	Semifinals	TEB BNP PARIBAS WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS	SEC
3660_8	Well, I think Petra plays a lot more aggressive. She's, you know, got a lot more visible, I guess, weapons than what Caroline has. But what Caroline, you know, does very, very well is, you know, things that, you know, that a normal tennis fan may not necessarily see. I mean, she moves well, competes extremely hard, and really makes you work for it; whereas Petra, you can see those flashes of great, great tennis. Yeah, two probably different styles, but, you know, I think, you know, Petra is a very exciting player to watch and probably deserves to be in that No.2 spot if she does win.	3660_8.a	2011-10-29	F	3660	Petra Kvitova	Samantha Stosur	If Petra wins tomorrow, she's going to be No.2, and she'll be pretty close to Caroline going into the new year. Could you just compare and sort of contrast their respective games from a player's perspective?	3660_8.q	7.0	0	Semifinals	TEB BNP PARIBAS WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS	SEC
3660_9	Yeah, I think she's definitely capable of being that No.1, in that No.1 position, and, you know, it's funny. She's very, very young, but already from when I first saw her when I played her at the French a couple years ago till now, it's amazing how much she's been able to improve. And even from when I played her at the Aussie Open till now, I think she's taken huge strides. She's got the game where you will see maybe a flurry of errors, but then you'll flip it over and you'll see that streak of winners. So I'm sure as she gets older she will only make that better and better. Yeah, I think she's capable of doing very good things.	3660_9.a	2011-10-29	F	3660	Petra Kvitova	Samantha Stosur	Of the maybe under 23 players that are out there right now, does she look to you, Petra, like the one with the skill? She can be erratic and she plays a high-risk game, but does she look like she has the skills that can really consolidate and be a solid No.1 player?	3660_9.q	7.0	0	Semifinals	TEB BNP PARIBAS WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS	SEC
3660_10	Yeah. I think for sure the last few years I think we've, on the women's side, really got a tournament schedule where, you know, you can make good decisions and make a good schedule and putting good breaks throughout the year so that you do still feel relatively fresh at this point in time. And now, to have two months off, I think it's obviously the best part we've ever been in before. Looking at the guys, I think it's crazy that they still have another month to play. And they go off and do all their XOs in that time as well. They kind of complain about it but don't make the situation any better for themselves, either.	3660_10.a	2011-10-29	F	3660	Petra Kvitova	Samantha Stosur	The men are still talking about the length of their season. You were saying you feel pretty good at this stage. Do you feel that's a sign that the women have got it just about right in terms of length of the year?	3660_10.q	7.0	0	Semifinals	TEB BNP PARIBAS WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS	SEC
3660_11	Oh, I'm sure it was really tough. I'm sure there were people out there that didn't want it and probably players that thought it was not good for them and they weren't going to get on court and weren't going to get points, weren't going to get money and whatever else. I think in the big scheme of things -- I don't think you'd find too many players disputing the way it's gone ahead. And I was a big, you know, advocate for shortening the season to where it is now, and I think it's pretty much perfect.	3660_11.a	2011-10-29	F	3660	Petra Kvitova	Samantha Stosur	But looking back, do you think it was a tough decision for the women to make to cut the year?	3660_11.q	7.0	0	Semifinals	TEB BNP PARIBAS WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS	SEC
3660_12	I haven't really thought about that too much right, you know, just yet, but I think there's always things you can always look to improve. And I have had times of the year where everything's really come together, and that's, you know, almost as good as what you could ask for. So I guess one of the goals would be to try to do that more often. It's not really necessarily working on one particular shot as such, but I'm sure once I sit down and really think hard about it, there will always be things you want to get better at.	3660_12.a	2011-10-29	F	3660	Petra Kvitova	Samantha Stosur	You've obviously improved a lot in the course of the season. Is there any part of your game you're going to look at during the offseason to improve even more?	3660_12.q	7.0	0	Semifinals	TEB BNP PARIBAS WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS	SEC
3660_13	Yeah, I don't know. I guess we'll see, but, you know, I don't think there's going to be any welcome home party at the airport this time. I guess I might be able to slip under the radar a little bit in that regard. I don't know. We'll see. If I do, then that's good. And if I don't, then that's okay, too. I'll take whatever comes. But it's obviously gonna be exciting, and I'm just looking forward to getting back.	3660_13.a	2011-10-29	F	3660	Petra Kvitova	Samantha Stosur	What are you expecting when you get back? You only had that four or five days after the US Open. Are you going to be bombarded with attention, do you think?	3660_13.q	7.0	0	Semifinals	TEB BNP PARIBAS WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS	SEC
3660_14	Well, that and probably go to the beach a little bit, try and see some friends, I'll get back up and see my family. So, I mean, not that much. It all sounds pretty mundane, but life on the road is kind of what you look forward to.	3660_14.a	2011-10-29	F	3660	Petra Kvitova	Samantha Stosur	What will you do in your down time? Sit up in your house and what else?	3660_14.q	7.0	0	Semifinals	TEB BNP PARIBAS WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS	SEC
3660_15	Yeah, I definitely want to try and see more of the city than what I have so far. So depending when my flight home is gonna be, I'll definitely try to see some more of Istanbul. If I happen to make it back here next year, then I will definitely be very excited to come back. I think it's been a great tournament, and, yeah, certainly I'm sure it can only get better next year. Once the first year is done, I'm sure there's always things you can look to improve.	3660_15.a	2011-10-29	F	3660	Petra Kvitova	Samantha Stosur	Are you planning to make sightseeing next couple of days? Are you excited to come back in next year in Istanbul?	3660_15.q	7.0	0	Semifinals	TEB BNP PARIBAS WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS	SEC
3660_16	No, it's not. I only found out about that this morning. I was quite happy about it.	3660_16.a	2011-10-29	F	3660	Petra Kvitova	Samantha Stosur	Your flight is not with Qantas, is it?	3660_16.q	7.0	0	Semifinals	TEB BNP PARIBAS WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS	SEC
1799_0	You could look at it that way, yeah.	1799_0.a	2008-06-24	F	1799	nan	Maria Sharapova	One down, six more to go?	1799_0.q	2.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1799_1	Yeah, it was definitely a good start, considering I didn't have a warmup tournament like I usually do. My main goal is just to go out there, get a feel for it as fast as I could and get the job done.	1799_1.a	2008-06-24	F	1799	nan	Maria Sharapova	Feel comfortable out there?	1799_1.q	2.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1799_2	Thank you.	1799_2.a	2008-06-24	F	1799	nan	Maria Sharapova	Quite an eye-catching outfit.	1799_2.q	2.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1799_3	I do. I usually wear-test it in one practice. But I usually do that like seven months before because, you know, the process takes quite a long time. I mean, I already know what I'm wearing, you know, in the fall 2009. So, you know, yeah, it's pretty far in advance because stuff has to go to retail and all that stuff.	1799_3.a	2008-06-24	F	1799	nan	Maria Sharapova	I'm wondering, how much do you test drive an outfit before you approve it? Is it comfortable to play in? How much did you test it?	1799_3.q	2.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1799_4	I love menswear in general. You know, I love tuxedo jackets. I love things that are actually a little bit baggier and wide. I loved when that whole wide-legged pant trend kind of set in, because I love that. I'm tall and I can pull those things off. So it was fun doing it because, you know, it's hard to do things different with white. You know, there's only so much you could do. I thought, why not do shorts this year? I've never done it at a Grand Slam. You know, if there's one place to do it, it's here.	1799_4.a	2008-06-24	F	1799	nan	Maria Sharapova	What inspired the white tuxedo look?	1799_4.q	2.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1799_5	Oh, goodness (laughter). I still haven't finished the tournament. We've got a lot in store.	1799_5.a	2008-06-24	F	1799	nan	Maria Sharapova	What will you wear next year then, if you already know?	1799_5.q	2.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1799_6	I don't know. A lot of the stuff I wear is actually promo only. Like the jacket's not in stores because the materials are usually brought in from Italy and France a lot of the time. Uhm, and, I don't know actually. I hope it does. It's a beautiful top. It's so well-done. To be able to perform in that, with it being so thin, so mobile, it's really cool.	1799_6.a	2008-06-24	F	1799	nan	Maria Sharapova	With all due respect, that top takes a certain type of body to pull that off. Do you really expect that to be a big seller off the rack?	1799_6.q	2.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1799_7	I didn't see it. I did see Federer's cardigan. I thought that was classic. It was beautiful.	1799_7.a	2008-06-24	F	1799	nan	Maria Sharapova	What did you think of Serena's raincoat and Roger's cardigan?	1799_7.q	2.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1799_8	I love how 10 of the questions are about what we're wearing. It's amazing.	1799_8.a	2008-06-24	F	1799	nan	Maria Sharapova	You spoke in New York with the black dress of your love of Audrey Hepburn, Breakfast at Tiffany's. Talk about tuxedos.	1799_8.q	2.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1799_9	No, I don't (laughter). Every time I get asked about it, it still amazes me.	1799_9.a	2008-06-24	F	1799	nan	Maria Sharapova	Did you expect anything else?	1799_9.q	2.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1799_10	As long as I'm amazed and not bored, you're doing a good job (laughter). I don't know why. Like I said, I think it's very flattering, especially on women, to be able to pull off a look that's basically menswear. You know, from very tailored jackets to things that are a little bit oversized, as well. I didn't wear my pants on court today, but they're very wide-legged and high-waisted. I love that trend. It's very classic. You can't go wrong with it. Like I said, if there's a place to do it, it's definitely Wimbledon.	1799_10.a	2008-06-24	F	1799	nan	Maria Sharapova	That's the point.	1799_10.q	2.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1799_11	You always do that (smiling).	1799_11.a	2008-06-24	F	1799	nan	Maria Sharapova	Not to bore you with a tennis question.	1799_11.q	2.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1799_12	I've had different experiences in Grand Slams. You know, sometimes I feel like I start off slow and I find my rhythm throughout the tournament. I get better and better. In France, even though I lost in the fourth round, I really feel like my level had stepped up from my three rounds. You know, like I said, I was so close to winning the match, and then you end up talking about losing the match. Very thin line between winning and losing. Obviously it's very important to start off the tournament on a good form. I knew my opponent has already played a couple of matches. Going on to Court 1 today, I knew the court would be a little bit different as the practice courts. It's not as worn out, as well. Just wanted to get a feel for it as fast as I could and do the right things and win the match as quickly as I could.	1799_12.a	2008-06-24	F	1799	nan	Maria Sharapova	In Australia you started playing well early, got off to a fast start, played great all the way through. In France, you kind of tried to work your way through. It's clay. Didn't work as well. Today you're playing well. Did you feel like coming in that's important for you to start playing well early, get a feel for the ball, maybe your game will come?	1799_12.q	2.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1799_13	I don't think it's that new. It's been around for a few years.	1799_13.a	2008-06-24	F	1799	nan	Maria Sharapova	Do you think all the attention to the fashion, is it more the players that happen to be at the top now, that you're all sort of fashion conscious and savvy, or is it more marketing by the tour? It's really relatively new that we talk so much about what the people are wearing, especially the women.	1799_13.q	2.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1799_14	Okay, that's new? I think it's great. I mean, look, tennis is not a sport where you have to wear uniforms. It's an individual sport. If you have the relationships with the brands, and I've been with Nike since I was very young and we've gained the trust in each other, you know, where we can go into a room and I can have a voice in what I like, what I don't like, my inspirations, what I feel like wearing, the colors I feel like wearing. It's a collaboration. It really is. If you can do that, why not? I've loved fashion since I was very young. I've loved creating things. I love materials. I loved working with thread and needles, making things on my own. Having Nike behind that, to be able to produce things like what I wore on court today, is incredible.	1799_14.a	2008-06-24	F	1799	nan	Maria Sharapova	I'm saying in the last few years, though.	1799_14.q	2.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1799_15	Absolutely not (smiling).	1799_15.a	2008-06-24	F	1799	nan	Maria Sharapova	Could you sew one yourself, do you think?	1799_15.q	2.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1799_16	Yeah, I have. A few times.	1799_16.a	2008-06-24	F	1799	nan	Maria Sharapova	What do you think of Nike? They really are a little bit of a risk-taker. They work with Federer, Serena. Have you been to their campus in Oregon?	1799_16.q	2.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1799_17	What I love about them is they really think out of the box. They're not one-dimensional. You know, they love experimenting. They love listening to what you feel comfortable with, what's going to work for you. They care about the athlete. That's so important, because they want you to go out and feel comfortable with what you're wearing. I think, you know, we also have to realize that in this world tennis is sort of small compared to soccer and compared to American football in the States. So, uhm, you know, they realize, you know, maybe not as many tennis dresses are going to be sold, but if we can create things that are exciting, that are very well-made... Like I said, they go into factories in little towns in Italy and they try to find the best material, the best buttons and everything in order to create this one look. It's great working with a company like that, that is able to -- you know, that is able to put things on the line and is not afraid of taking chances.	1799_17.a	2008-06-24	F	1799	nan	Maria Sharapova	What are your thoughts about their people and their approach in the market?	1799_17.q	2.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1799_18	Yeah, numerous times, tons of times. We had a meeting a couple months ago. Yeah, there are a lot of times where you don't agree on things, but that's the fun thing of it. It's about creating something special that both of you like.	1799_18.a	2008-06-24	F	1799	nan	Maria Sharapova	On the flipside, have they ever brought in a concept where you shook your head?	1799_18.q	2.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1799_19	I don't think so, no.	1799_19.a	2008-06-24	F	1799	nan	Maria Sharapova	Are you going to carry the flag for Russia at the opening ceremony?	1799_19.q	2.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1799_20	It motivates me on a different level. I'm so proud they got through that. You know, it was kind of nerve-wracking when it was tied five minutes left into the game. We really thought we had it. You know, we're brave. We're strong. We work hard at what we do. Good things happen.	1799_20.a	2008-06-24	F	1799	nan	Maria Sharapova	Speaking of Russia, you were talking about the football team on Saturday. They're through to the semifinals. How does that motivate you?	1799_20.q	2.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1799_21	Prouder? We've always been proud. That's one thing we don't lack.	1799_21.a	2008-06-24	F	1799	nan	Maria Sharapova	Are Russians prouder now than a few years ago?	1799_21.q	2.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
2154_0	Well, it happens in tennis. It's never over until it's over. It showed today. I thought it was a very up-and-down match, obviously. I think I should have won the first and he completely lost his game for an hour there, you know, through the second, the third. It was unfortunate I couldn't serve it up.	2154_0.a	2009-08-14	M	2154	nan	Roger Federer	An adjective to describe what happened if you can, Roger? How do you describe that?	2154_0.q	1.0	0	Quarterfinals	ROGERS CUP	Masters 1000
2154_1	No. I'm used to playing so many matches that that stuff doesn't bother me, you know. He didn't look injured to me. He was just not serving very well, you know. If that then had something to do with his arm or whatever from him falling, I don't know. No, I was just trying to focus on the match and trying to close it out.	2154_1.a	2009-08-14	M	2154	nan	Roger Federer	Do you feel when you wonder if your opponent is injured that it's hard to stay in it in that moment?	2154_1.q	1.0	0	Quarterfinals	ROGERS CUP	Masters 1000
2154_2	No. Yeah, I mean, I didn't serve well in the first serve, but I still thought I should have maybe won it. We had a fun tiebreaker. Then his serve completely went off. But it wasn't too windy out there. Actually it was quite surprising.	2154_2.a	2009-08-14	M	2154	nan	Roger Federer	Was it windy? Because the serve...	2154_2.q	1.0	0	Quarterfinals	ROGERS CUP	Masters 1000
2154_3	Well, I mean, now you talk like this. If I would have won, you don't talk like this. Obviously it's the same for me. All in all I thought it was a decent match. I didn't think it was bad, but it wasn't great, either. It's one of those matches I can live with, you know. Of course I hope I get through them, especially being up a double break and stuff. So it's obviously disappointing, but you know, that's what Jo does. He doesn't make a return for three hours, and then he puts in a few and then all of a sudden he gets back into the match. I never should have allowed it, but it did happen so it's a pity.	2154_3.a	2009-08-14	M	2154	nan	Roger Federer	Are there any elements of last year when you came in and against Simon, maybe you hadn't played enough after Wimbledon. This year you had a longer rest. Does anything like that...	2154_3.q	1.0	0	Quarterfinals	ROGERS CUP	Masters 1000
2154_4	Well, I mean, I thought it was fine. It was great to get some matches in, you know, ahead of Cincinnati and at the US Open, but you know, my goal wasn't really just to play matches here and sort of show up and do press conferences, you know. That was not the point of the whole -- the whole trip here was trying to do well and trying to win the tournament. So obviously I didn't reach that, but it's fine, you know. I've had a lot happening the last few months and so it's not a complete disappointment, because I still thought I played all right.	2154_4.a	2009-08-14	M	2154	nan	Roger Federer	What do you take overall from the tournament and the three matches you got in here?	2154_4.q	1.0	0	Quarterfinals	ROGERS CUP	Masters 1000
2154_5	Closing out a match like that. (laughter.) You can't really work on that, you know. But just go out in the practice courts, you know. Try to work on a few things and just make sure -- to get off a good start over there, because conditions are different again. Who knows? Maybe it will be warmer, maybe more windy, different opponents, different draw. So it's not easy. You know, those Masters Series you can see -- look at the draw today. Top eight players are left, so obviously it's always hard to win any kind of matches like this. Yeah, I'm looking forward to playing next week as well.	2154_5.a	2009-08-14	M	2154	nan	Roger Federer	What will you look to improve for in Cincinnati?	2154_5.q	1.0	0	Quarterfinals	ROGERS CUP	Masters 1000
2154_6	Well, you know, in the moment it just happens. You just try to go game by game, point by point. Next thing you know you're up after you're disappointed, you know, you lost the first set. I thought I should have won that. Then I'm up 5-1 and I end up finding myself at 5-All 10 minutes later. It was a tough match to sort of go through, you know, because either it was very close or very one-sided. That didn't make it easy on the rhythm, obviously.	2154_6.a	2009-08-14	M	2154	nan	Roger Federer	If you forget the first set, it's 6-1, 5-1, can you recall letting one get away like that that you've dominated for that long a period?	2154_6.q	1.0	0	Quarterfinals	ROGERS CUP	Masters 1000
2154_7	Well, I mean, if I look at this match, I guess so, but I think he can do better than that, you know. I don't think he's just a streaky player; otherwise he wouldn't be top 10 in the world. He's got a wonderful serve. His first serve is great. It's hard to read. It's got great pace. He's a great athlete, you know. He's got a good forehand too, and that makes him a dangerous player. I definitely think he's got, you know, much more potential to find in his game to even become a better player, but he's done very well already thus far, and I'm sure we'll see him much more in the future.	2154_7.a	2009-08-14	M	2154	nan	Roger Federer	How difficult a player is he? You played him before, but what are the real challenges for you? Is it streakiness?	2154_7.q	1.0	0	Quarterfinals	ROGERS CUP	Masters 1000
2154_8	Well, I think I got off bad starts on all of my service games towards the end. I think I was down maybe Love-30 in each service game. That was a problem for me. If I maybe just get off 15-Love, 30-15 kind of game, then things might look different, you know. But I didn't, so I had to scramble each time and have to start playing safe a little bit, and that's exactly kind of what he needed because otherwise I was just going to hand it over to him. This way, you know, he made me work for it and he did well to come back. It's not something I go through very often, being up 5-1 and ending up losing, get broken back to back after having not broken especially throughout the whole match. It's tough, you know, but you're still in it with a chance. But in both tiebreaks I served horribly, and I guess that cost me the match in the end.	2154_8.a	2009-08-14	M	2154	nan	Roger Federer	What was going through your head as the games kept slipping away at the end of the third?	2154_8.q	1.0	0	Quarterfinals	ROGERS CUP	Masters 1000
3314_0	Yeah, it was tougher than yesterday. I wished every day would be there with two wins. I thought I played actually well today, in singles and in doubles. Sure, it's a bit of a pity that I couldn't get either one of them, but that's how it goes, you know, when you sign up for doubles. That's what can happen. It's no problem. I thought I played good in the singles. I also thought the week with Stan in doubles was a lot of fun and I really enjoyed it. I just thought Dolgopolov and Malisse played really well today in the final.	3314_0.a	2011-03-19	M	3314	Novak Djokovic	Roger Federer	Can you just sum up this kind of average day? Not a great day, but how did it play out for you?	3314_0.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
3314_1	In the doubles?	3314_1.a	2011-03-19	M	3314	Novak Djokovic	Roger Federer	Have you had a chance to think about what may have happened at 3-2, 40-15, third set?	3314_1.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
3314_2	Just checking. (Laughter.) Just gotta make sure we hit the right match. It's confusing otherwise. At 3-2?	3314_2.a	2011-03-19	M	3314	Novak Djokovic	Roger Federer	No, in the singles.	3314_2.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
3314_3	2-All, 40-15.	3314_3.a	2011-03-19	M	3314	Novak Djokovic	Roger Federer	3-2, 40-15.	3314_3.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
3314_4	Sure, would have been 3-2 and him to serve, so you never know what happens. Scoring in tennis is tough, you know. That's why momentum swings can be quite big. So, no, I mean, I had my chances today in the singles. I thought it was a good match, played at a high level. I know I wasn't far away at all today, because I really had him going. But look, I guess he escaped. I guess confidence is a big thing for him at the moment. I'm sure it's gonna be a good final tomorrow.	3314_4.a	2011-03-19	M	3314	Novak Djokovic	Roger Federer	2-All, yeah.	3314_4.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
3314_5	Well, I mean, he's gone definitely also through ups and downs in his career, which is normal. I remember he played really well - I don't know if it was the same year that he won the World Tour Finals in Shanghai and the Australian Open - but I thought he played extremely well, as well, at the World Tour Finals. Then he obviously switched racquets, and, you know, things were still okay for him, but maybe just not at the very top of the game. Maybe he struggled just a bit more, and things have turned around for him a bit more now. But it's normal that, you know, in your career you go through better and worse spells. It's just important to keep it at the high level, and that's what he's been able to do for many years now.	3314_5.a	2011-03-19	M	3314	Novak Djokovic	Roger Federer	How has his play evolved?	3314_5.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
3314_6	Um, no. That's all in his mind. In his play you don't feel that a ball has a bit more topspin or not. It's coming quick enough regardless, you know. As a young player, when we played early on, I can see that. You know, the first time I played him in Monte-Carlo, I don't think he really probably thought and believed he was gonna beat me. I never thought in my wildest dreams I was gonna lose against him, and still it was a three-set match. I came out of it and I thought he was a good player. But still you just expect yourself to win. Obviously with many matches played at the highest of levels, it's normal that you start believing, you know, more. If he weren't saying that, something is wrong with the guy. So all is completely normal, which is a good thing.	3314_6.a	2011-03-19	M	3314	Novak Djokovic	Roger Federer	He says that before when he played you he was just kind of hoping that he could beat you. Now he actually believes inside that if he plays a little bit more of an aggressive game he can stay with you. Do you notice that?	3314_6.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
3314_7	Um, like a tournament like London when you beat five top guys in a row? That's all right. I was happy with that. I went on vacation feeling pretty good about myself. I don't know if the other guys felt that way. That was a nice time off for me. And, you know, then I played well in Doha; played well in Australia; played well here; played well in Dubai. Just because I have a loss here and there doesn't mean I'm not playing well. I mean, if I were to be playing well not well and feeling I didn't really have the tools or the game or the mindset or the condition, you know, to come through, then it would be an issue, but it's not. That's why I'm not even asking myself that question.	3314_7.a	2011-03-19	M	3314	Novak Djokovic	Roger Federer	Since Paul Annacone joined your team you've played tough tournaments, made the semifinals each time or better. You tend to take the long view. So what is there still to do that's gonna convert semifinals or better into matches like this where you'll be able to get past someone at the top of the game like Djokovic?	3314_7.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
3314_8	Um, it's not frustrating. It's just disappointing, you know. Yeah, there is a different -- frustrating can be quite negative and quite, you know, pulling yourself down. But, no, it's happened before. You know, I remember losing to Murray in a short period of time on a few occasions. It happened against Nadal. That's what I always said. If you get off a good start and start beating one guy, then you play him the same -- you're playing the same guy on few occasions in a short period of time, you can get quite a few wins, you know. I did that at the end of last year against him. He did it now at the beginning of the year against me. That's how it goes, you know. I don't know if I'd rather lose against three multiple different guys, you know, ranked outside of the top 50. I guess not. I'd rather lose against a guy that's ranked very high so I know I'm controlling the rest of the field against top guys. If I'm playing well, I know I can beat them, too. So that's what it is. At the end of the day I can't change it, and I'm happy with my game.	3314_8.a	2011-03-19	M	3314	Novak Djokovic	Roger Federer	Is it doubly frustrating to lose to the same person three times so far this year, or is it a loss is a loss and it's frustrating anyway?	3314_8.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
3314_9	I guess it's part of that. They don't quite know themselves yet what's the best way to play. They decide to come in sometimes; they stay back. It's not classic doubles, even though Xavier can play that well very easily; Alexandr, honestly I've never seen him play doubles before, so it's hard for me to know exactly, you know, what he normally likes to do in the doubles. But, you know, just the way, you know, especially Dolgopolov returns, just goes for broke kind of thing. It's tricky, and it seemed to work. Maybe conditions helped them tonight. It was a bit slower, you couldn't use the kick serve, and the bounce as much. But at the end of the day they won the superbreaker, which is not purely luck. They were good and tough all the way through, you know. We had our chances, but what I liked about them is they had a good attitude, you know, maybe very relaxed. I'm also very relaxed in doubles, but still feel I need a bit more intensity to do well, which was a fun doubles to be part of. I really enjoyed it.	3314_9.a	2011-03-19	M	3314	Novak Djokovic	Roger Federer	You said in the doubles they played an unconventional game. Can you explain it a little bit? What made them difficult to beat? Because they only played just one week together.	3314_9.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
3314_10	It's a great subject. I love talking about that right now.	3314_10.a	2011-03-19	M	3314	Novak Djokovic	Roger Federer	Can I switch topics a bit? The Wayne Odesnik situation, the guy who was suspended for a year.	3314_10.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
3314_11	I didn't know that.	3314_11.a	2011-03-19	M	3314	Novak Djokovic	Roger Federer	But he's been playing a couple months futures, and I'm sure you're aware of that.	3314_11.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
3314_12	I don't know. I don't know the guy. I didn't know he was playing again. Ask someone else. Not me.	3314_12.a	2011-03-19	M	3314	Novak Djokovic	Roger Federer	He talked to the ITF and got the suspension reduced by one year. What do you think the reception is going to be for the guy when he comes back on the tour?	3314_12.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
3314_13	No problem. I've done it many times before. I think I did it at the Olympics. I've done it before in big occasions, as well. It's just part of what we do, you know. I'm not a guy who's disappointed for a long time. Takes me half an hour and I'm all right, or 15 minutes sometimes. So important for me is, you know, I know that I gave 100% out there and I tried. That's all can I do, you know. If I feel like the effort I put in there wasn't the best I could, if I could have done so many things differently and I didn't use those, then it would be very frustrating and disappointing. But it's not the case anymore for me. You know, I always give 100% and I know I left everything out there, so then the turnaround for me is pretty quick. It was more tough I guess physically to some degree, because you come off a big match like that and you cool down, it's like a rain delay, in a way. It's fine. You know, I played pretty good in the doubles, too, and it was okay.	3314_13.a	2011-03-19	M	3314	Novak Djokovic	Roger Federer	How difficult was it to go through a tough loss today and then turn around in just a couple hours and try to bring your focus back to the doubles? Was it hard?	3314_13.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
3523_0	I feel good, but I surprising because I'm in final. Maybe I'm surprising myself, because it's pretty tough, you know, here and just Federer, Nadal, Tsonga. I'm not really top 10, and, you know, for me it's tough tournament. Beat today Nadal, No.1. I know he's last year have good form. I don't know, today he feel different. For sure he was not best form. Normally he's much tougher and plays -- he's stronger. I don't mean tennis; I mean physically. He was completely tired running, fighting for points.	3523_0.a	2011-01-07	M	3523	Rafael Nadal	Nikolay Davydenko	First tournament of the year and another final. How do you feel?	3523_0.q	22.0	1	Semifinals	QATAR EXXONMOBILE OPEN	ATP250
3523_1	Because last year I won because I won London. That's was, for me, I don't care against who I play. I beat also Nadal and Federer in the Masters Cup. Here in Doha, for me, it's like same situation, it was. Last year, if you see after Doha, I didn't win any tournaments. After my injury I play not so good, and I didn't make any semifinal. I have no good result. That's was, for me, really surprising beginning this year. I am again the final, and I hope it's not be my last final, you know, in this year.	3523_1.a	2011-01-07	M	3523	Rafael Nadal	Nikolay Davydenko	But why do you say you're surprised? You certainly have the game, and you've won here in Doha. Why do you say you're surprised?	3523_1.q	22.0	1	Semifinals	QATAR EXXONMOBILE OPEN	ATP250
3523_2	You know, every day is level different, because how you feel just -- you know, how you sleep and you wake up and you feel so comfortable and you are relaxed and not so much nervous and you play easy and fighting for every points and feel good balls. I see already how I, before warmup, starting warmup before the match, and I already know how I play and how I feel, and I know I need to be nervous or not.	3523_2.a	2011-01-07	M	3523	Rafael Nadal	Nikolay Davydenko	What do you think your level is now? Is it similar level to here last year or not?	3523_2.q	22.0	1	Semifinals	QATAR EXXONMOBILE OPEN	ATP250
3523_3	Pretty good, really. Just was not so easy to run here, you know, just very difficult running on this surface here in Doha. I don't know why it's really surprising me. Last year it's was -- physically I was much better and running much faster. Now, you know, maybe my tennis a little bit better, but physically I'm not so strong, you know. Every point running, it's not so easy.	3523_3.a	2011-01-07	M	3523	Rafael Nadal	Nikolay Davydenko	And how did you feel before the match today?	3523_3.q	22.0	1	Semifinals	QATAR EXXONMOBILE OPEN	ATP250
3523_4	For sure, you know, by every match, winning, you know, guys, top 10 players beating on the tournaments, it's confidence coming back, and for sure it's helping me so much, you know, come back. Level, it's also coming, you know, tennis level, and automatically, you know, coming after physically, for sure, because fighting for the points, every points and running. I hope, you know, for Australian Open I can be fit also for five-sets matches.	3523_4.a	2011-01-07	M	3523	Rafael Nadal	Nikolay Davydenko	So do you think your best tennis is still to come?	3523_4.q	22.0	1	Semifinals	QATAR EXXONMOBILE OPEN	ATP250
3523_5	Now I start to be nervous, because you really pushing me, finals, six winning (smiling). Yeah, would be nice winning seven. You know, it's not so bad. But I don't play, you know, against, you know, top 50 guys. I play against, you know, good player, Federer. It's different. I never play final, I think, against Federer. Always play semis or quarters, but the final I play always against Nadal. That's was for me much easier to win. I don't know why. Now it's different situation. That's was I think it would be much tougher.	3523_5.a	2011-01-07	M	3523	Rafael Nadal	Nikolay Davydenko	It doesn't look you have to be nervous for the final. You have such a good record. You won the last six finals, so something special where you go on the last day of the tournament?	3523_5.q	22.0	1	Semifinals	QATAR EXXONMOBILE OPEN	ATP250
3523_6	For sure I want to come back in top 10 this year, because I really good practice and I have good tennis now, and, you know, it's just starting tournaments. Last year my hope was the same. You know, winning Doha, quarterfinals Australia Open was -- yeah, every tournament make result. But, you know, if you injury, and then you cannot play three months, then it already start different situation, and it's like you don't know what's can happen. That's was I don't want to say anything. My goal, it's my goal. I just want to enjoy and not to be injured. If I enjoy tennis, for sure I can make good result.	3523_6.a	2011-01-07	M	3523	Rafael Nadal	Nikolay Davydenko	I'm gonna push it some more. Federer said today that when you're healthy, when you're fit again, that you should be a regular player in the top 5. So what are your goals for this season?	3523_6.q	22.0	1	Semifinals	QATAR EXXONMOBILE OPEN	ATP250
3523_7	Memory, it's like I can win easy and then I lost easy. You know, that's was memory. Yeah, last year I lost in Cincinnati again in semifinal, and, you know, just -- but is already I have different level. You know, now is maybe my tennis level better, and that's was if I still continue like I play today or yesterday before, you know, and just I feel my forehand, backhand I can play good, I have good control, if I still tomorrow the same, you know, level or maybe better, you know, just important for sure I need to have good legs and I need to run and control the ball. Because I saw Federer try to play fast, easy, just two, three points, try to make winners, you don't want to run so much, and that's was for me I need to find this, you know, solution, how I need to play against him tomorrow.	3523_7.a	2011-01-07	M	3523	Rafael Nadal	Nikolay Davydenko	Which memories you have about your match against Roger in Australian Open last year?	3523_7.q	22.0	1	Semifinals	QATAR EXXONMOBILE OPEN	ATP250
3523_8	I never stop with my brother, because he is now have tennis academy and he work with his son. Son plays some Futures every week most this year, and for sure he's come with me now Doha and Australian Open, maybe Rotterdam, but after America, like Indian Wells and Miami, I have another coach, because he want to spend time with his son also on the Futures. A rare mix, but I never change coach, just for time, you know, just for couple tournaments. And then if he see I play bad, he just come back again. He coaching me again. But now we have good time. We are practicing together all December, and he just -- he wanted, you know, because I need to defend points and he want to start with me now here and just see how I play. If I start to play good, he say, Okay. You play good and you can go now alone.	3523_8.a	2011-01-07	M	3523	Rafael Nadal	Nikolay Davydenko	Can you tell us about your coaching situation? I think you had stopped working with your brother last year? Are you back with him? Can you tell us everything behind it?	3523_8.q	22.0	1	Semifinals	QATAR EXXONMOBILE OPEN	ATP250
3523_9	If I was five times quarterfinal, I think so, I have good chance. Just only problem I am not top 8 seeded player. I am already not top 16. That's was is already a different situation. That's was I can play against Nadal, Djokovic, or Federer already in the fourth round or fifth round, yeah? That's was already difficult. You know, just need to see against who I play and how I play.	3523_9.a	2011-01-07	M	3523	Rafael Nadal	Nikolay Davydenko	Of the four Grand Slam tournaments, is the Australian Open the one where you think you have the most chances of going far?	3523_9.q	22.0	1	Semifinals	QATAR EXXONMOBILE OPEN	ATP250
1823_0	Yeah, I'll tell you as much as I know. Obviously we'll know more tomorrow. I met with my trainer and with the doctors. They don't think anything is torn. Like I said, we'll know more, but -- you know, I was just going back after I hit the shot, and there's a difference in height between where the grass court ends and where the concrete goes, and I just unfortunately stepped at a bad angle. It kind of just twisted a little bit. Running straight ahead I was all right; side to side was suspect.	1823_0.a	2009-06-13	M	1823	James Blake	Andy Roddick	How is it? Can you tell us what you've done and what the situation is?	1823_0.q	6.0	0	Semifinals	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
1823_1	Yeah.	1823_1.a	2009-06-13	M	1823	James Blake	Andy Roddick	Kind of a freak accident, isn't it?	1823_1.q	6.0	0	Semifinals	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
1823_2	Yeah, the point was over. I mean, I was laughing at James.	1823_2.a	2009-06-13	M	1823	James Blake	Andy Roddick	You weren't even running?	1823_2.q	6.0	0	Semifinals	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
1823_3	Yeah. I mean, I'm going to do everything I can to play at Wimbledon. We'll know more -- I wish I had more answers for you right now. We're scheduled to get it looked at again tomorrow and do some scans on it and see where we're at, but initial tests showed the stability was okay. Strength was okay. It was just range of motion was limited right now. So that's good as far as -- you know, I'm not walking in here saying I'm going to be out six weeks or anything like that. We're looking at days, not weeks.	1823_3.a	2009-06-13	M	1823	James Blake	Andy Roddick	Is it too early to say about Wimbledon, or must you let it settle down for 24 hours to have a look at it again?	1823_3.q	6.0	0	Semifinals	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
1823_4	Yeah. I mean, a little bit.	1823_4.a	2009-06-13	M	1823	James Blake	Andy Roddick	Is it swollen up at all?	1823_4.q	6.0	0	Semifinals	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
1823_5	Yeah.	1823_5.a	2009-06-13	M	1823	James Blake	Andy Roddick	You've always worn the ankle straps, haven't you?	1823_5.q	6.0	0	Semifinals	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
1823_6	Yeah, I've been lucky. Well, I mean, you can look at it two ways. I've had numerous times on both ankles where you get it, and it's a three-, four-, five-day sprain, but I've never blown it out. Obviously it's providing a little bit -- the brace has provided a little bit of protection. I always seem to catch myself before I go over all the way, but...	1823_6.a	2009-06-13	M	1823	James Blake	Andy Roddick	I guess it makes you think what it might have been if you hadn't had those on?	1823_6.q	6.0	0	Semifinals	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
1823_7	If I'm healthy, I don't think it will affect it at all. I've gotten in three-and-a-half matches, which is what you're looking -- you come to this event and you're looking -- obviously you want to win, but I think more importantly you want to -- you know, I've faced some tough circumstances in my last couple of matches. I felt like I was hitting the ball fine, moving fine, serving really well. It wasn't the first match of the week, so I don't have two weeks to wait before I play match again. So as far as tennis-wise and preparation, I'm not worried about that at this point.	1823_7.a	2009-06-13	M	1823	James Blake	Andy Roddick	Leaving aside Wimbledon and your prospects there, how much of a blow is this? Because you've been looking in such good form this week, hitting the ball great. Your serve has been great.	1823_7.q	6.0	0	Semifinals	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
1823_8	Yeah, well, he had gotten away with one early in the week against Sam. We always joke about his lobs. I tried to hit a lob, and I was kind of almost just back-pedaling. I just misstepped. It could have happened, you know, walking off a sidewalk down a curb. I mean, it's just one of those things, I guess.	1823_8.a	2009-06-13	M	1823	James Blake	Andy Roddick	You say you were laughing at James. Because you had hit the ball through your legs...	1823_8.q	6.0	0	Semifinals	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
1823_9	Yeah. I mean -- yes. You want to play well, and obviously this is the only leadup we have for Wimbledon so it's very important in our calendar. I think more than anything it's just against my nature to be smart about things and not risk further injury for Wimbledon. I mean, I did have 1-All, and it was still -- I was hoping I could walk it off and it would go away, but that wasn't the case. So to kind of walk out of a match is -- I don't like that feeling at all. You know, obviously with the bigger picture in mind, I could only make it worse out there. I wasn't going to help my prospects at Wimbledon at all by going through the motions out there and moving at, you know, 20 or 30% of what I can.	1823_9.a	2009-06-13	M	1823	James Blake	Andy Roddick	You have such a great association with this tournament. Does that add to the frustration of what happened today?	1823_9.q	6.0	0	Semifinals	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
1823_10	It's going to be tough. I think Andy has been in real good form this week. But James has weapons; that's the main difference. He can strike winners off both sides. He's going to -- he'll have to go for his shots. It's just a matter of if he's able to execute.	1823_10.a	2009-06-13	M	1823	James Blake	Andy Roddick	What's your take on James' chances in the final?	1823_10.q	6.0	0	Semifinals	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
1832_0	Yeah, I'm really happy, you know. You know, I beat a guy top 15, so of course I'm really happy, especially here at Queen's. I'm third round, so I want to go further.	1832_0.a	2009-06-10	M	1832	Marin Cilic	Nicolas Mahut	You must be pretty pleased with that after the tough time you've been having?	1832_0.q	146.0	1	2nd Round	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
1832_1	I mean, I don't know what happened. My racquet just disappeared before my match, so I don't know. Maybe a player took it by mistake. I don't know what happened really. We have to find out, but we have to ask two other players.	1832_1.a	2009-06-10	M	1832	Marin Cilic	Nicolas Mahut	Can you talk about what you mentioned on the TV interview about the racquet?	1832_1.q	146.0	1	2nd Round	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
1832_2	No, just one.	1832_2.a	2009-06-10	M	1832	Marin Cilic	Nicolas Mahut	All your racquets?	1832_2.q	146.0	1	2nd Round	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
1832_3	Hopefully I had four more in the bag.	1832_3.a	2009-06-10	M	1832	Marin Cilic	Nicolas Mahut	Just one?	1832_3.q	146.0	1	2nd Round	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
1832_4	I mean, I love this surface so much. You know, since I was junior, I won the Wimbledon title in junior. You know, here is my favorite tournament. I cannot explain how much I like to play on this -- especially on the center court. You know, even if I lost in final with match points two years ago, it's so many good memories from -- I mean, the crowd was just fantastic with me, and I have fun, you know. I cannot explain. I really love play here. You know, I played two good matches, and, you know, the road is really long, but I know the way to go farther.	1832_4.a	2009-06-10	M	1832	Marin Cilic	Nicolas Mahut	How are you feeling on grass this year? You've had a good record here before, and you've got the game to go far.	1832_4.q	146.0	1	2nd Round	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
1832_5	Yeah, I can serve and volley and I can -- I can play really aggressive. It's a good surface for my game.	1832_5.a	2009-06-10	M	1832	Marin Cilic	Nicolas Mahut	Do you think grass is best suited to your game?	1832_5.q	146.0	1	2nd Round	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
1832_6	Maybe this match was really important for my career. From this match, I know I can beat everyone. I can lose, too, but I can beat everyone. So every time I play on this surface, I know I can be really dangerous.	1832_6.a	2009-06-10	M	1832	Marin Cilic	Nicolas Mahut	And you obviously beat Nadal in 2007 here. That must prove to you that you can beat the best players.	1832_6.q	146.0	1	2nd Round	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
1832_7	You know, I don't know. I have to pass through the qualification first, because I'm not in -- I'm not in the main draw with my ranking, so I ask for invitation wildcard, so maybe I will get one. From now, I have to play next Monday qualification. It's too far.	1832_7.a	2009-06-10	M	1832	Marin Cilic	Nicolas Mahut	Do you think you can be a threat at Wimbledon?	1832_7.q	146.0	1	2nd Round	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
4682_0	Well, it happens. It's not the first time. So it's always strange situation, but at the end of the day I just have to focus on the first one. I think it's going to be a tough match against him. He's a very good grass court player, and I think he played a great tournament until now. So I just hope I would play the same kind of tennis as today. Well, just expect a great match tomorrow.	4682_0.a	2013-06-21	M	4682	Andreas Seppi	Gilles Simon	Good win. How do you feel about facing Lopez tomorrow and then again in the first round?	4682_0.q	17.0	1	Semifinals	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	ATP250
4682_1	What do you mean, the length of the match or...	4682_1.a	2013-06-21	M	4682	Andreas Seppi	Gilles Simon	It was pretty convincing out there at times today. Was it comfortable at times?	4682_1.q	17.0	1	Semifinals	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	ATP250
4682_2	Just the way I played? I think he's playing great. He just had a slow start as he had in the match before. I knew it, and I wanted to take advantage of it. I managed to do it. I was 30, double break up. Unfortunately today the conditions were horrible, so it's harder to hold your serve than the other day, and the serve was not very effective for both of us. So it was a real battle from the baseline. Andreas is just a good player. I know him. He won two years ago. He made the final here. He has very good timing, so he's never missing some stupid shots. You have to work, to work, to play great. I think we played a very highlevel second set today.	4682_2.a	2013-06-21	M	4682	Andreas Seppi	Gilles Simon	Just the opponent.	4682_2.q	17.0	1	Semifinals	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	ATP250
4682_3	No, really I said it's horrible week for me just before. I had everything. I was so sick. I twisted my ankle. I broke my neck. I said, Okay, it's too much. I will never play this tournament. (Laughter.) No, it was like week before, and the first match was really complicated. Against Kyle I was feeling terrible on the court, and I'm just happy that I managed to get through this one. And then it was, you know, better after this. It's just good timing, and I'm just lucky that it happened the week before than during the tournament.	4682_3.a	2013-06-21	M	4682	Andreas Seppi	Gilles Simon	It's been quite a week. On Monday you were limping off the practice court. Now you're in the final. Were you unsure at the start of the week whether you could play?	4682_3.q	17.0	1	Semifinals	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	ATP250
4682_4	Yeah, I know how it works. Well, really I just don't know, because I don't know what happened during this match. It was the first match for me on grass. I think already grass is different than the rest of the season. And one more time I was, in a way, playing very relaxed because I was really sick and I couldn't go for more. But then to play relaxed on grass also helps you, and so it's difficult to say. Only thing obviously he's a great player already, very consistent, he has no weaknesses. He has a good serve, good backhand, good forehand. And he's only 18, which is already a good start. (Smiling.) I just don't want to bet on something. I just want to see how he's gonna improve his game. It was already pretty convincing on the court from what I saw. Then you just have to see, you know, month after month.	4682_4.a	2013-06-21	M	4682	Andreas Seppi	Gilles Simon	To go back to Kyle, what was your impression of him? Because obviously there is a lot of buzz about him at the moment.	4682_4.q	17.0	1	Semifinals	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	ATP250
4682_5	It's a tough question, but I think that the game of tomorrow is really important for the match on Monday also, or Tuesday. So it's a tough call, because my of course my objective is, my goal is to be as good as possible in Wimbledon, and to lose in the first round would be disappointing for me, but to win tomorrow would be, I think for me, because I would have won tournaments on every continent on every type of court, which would be good, also. I mean, I won't have any more, any opportunities maybe to win one, and the answer would be tomorrow. Because still I think that if I win tomorrow it's a great advantage for the match after, anyway.	4682_5.a	2013-06-21	M	4682	Andreas Seppi	Gilles Simon	Which game would you rather win, the game tomorrow or the first round Wimbledon game?	4682_5.q	17.0	1	Semifinals	AEGON INTERNATIONAL	ATP250
3984_0	Yeah, actually, wanted to continue my play what I played in the second set, and, I mean, I had a lot of chances to break her. I mean, I didn't do it, and it was really tough to be like concentrate on my serve. I know that all games in the third set I served very well, and then was a game that I didn't really have like first serves or something, and she return very well in this game. Yeah, it was unfortunate for me.	3984_0.a	2012-01-26	F	3984	Maria Sharapova	Petra Kvitova	You seemed to get some momentum in that second set. How did the third set play out to Maria's advantage, do you think?	3984_0.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3984_1	Well, yeah, I mean, she played some break points very well, but, yeah, I mean, I could be more aggressive and more go for the winners and not only waiting, waiting what she's can do.	3984_1.a	2012-01-26	F	3984	Maria Sharapova	Petra Kvitova	Was that the difference? She took advantage of her break point opportunities?	3984_1.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3984_2	No, I don't think so. I mean, actually I don't remember this challenge, so I don't think so (smiling).	3984_2.a	2012-01-26	F	3984	Maria Sharapova	Petra Kvitova	There was a challenge at 4All in the third set that would have given you Love40. Do you think that was a big turning point in the end of the match?	3984_2.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3984_3	Yes, of course I'm disappointed right now. I mean, if I look back, I don't know, in week, for example, it will be good tournament for me, first semifinal in the Australian Open. But, you know, I fight and nothing, nothing at all. So, I mean, yeah, I have to say that Maria play good tennis today. Yeah, so, I mean, now I'm really sad, but in the next days it will be fine.	3984_3.a	2012-01-26	F	3984	Maria Sharapova	Petra Kvitova	Can you talk about how you feel overall? Are you disappointed not to get through today?	3984_3.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3984_4	Where?	3984_4.a	2012-01-26	F	3984	Maria Sharapova	Petra Kvitova	Are you going to the Laureusin London. How do you see your chances there?	3984_4.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3984_5	I don't know, actually. Actually, I don't care now right now about this. We will see. A lot of great sportswomen with me, so it's really tough to say anything. But I'm looking forward to be there, of course.	3984_5.a	2012-01-26	F	3984	Maria Sharapova	Petra Kvitova	How do you see your chances there?	3984_5.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3984_6	You know, it was grass and here is the hard court. So I mean, it's something in change, but still the game what we are playing is the still the same. And, I mean, probably I play more aggressive in the Wimbledon and didn't have like a lot of mistakes what I did today. But, anyway, it's there. I mean, it was fine match for the people, hopefully. I'm looking forward for the next matches.	3984_6.a	2012-01-26	F	3984	Maria Sharapova	Petra Kvitova	Were there any big changes in her performance in this match compared to the Wimbledon final?	3984_6.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3984_7	Well, yeah. I mean, in the future it's can do. Like many of us who is really top can be No.1. Yeah, we are fighting again about the No.1.	3984_7.a	2012-01-26	F	3984	Maria Sharapova	Petra Kvitova	Do you still have some meanings on that No.1? I mean, in the future, you can get it, as well.	3984_7.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3984_8	Maybe tomorrow.	3984_8.a	2012-01-26	F	3984	Maria Sharapova	Petra Kvitova	Are you going to hang around here to watch Adam?	3984_8.q	2.0	0	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4927_0	Yeah, I think so. It was hurting a little bit, but after tape I was okay.	4927_0.a	2013-01-04	M	4927	Alexandr Dolgopolov	Kei Nishikori	You managed to pull it out. Is your knee okay?	4927_0.q	19.0	1	Quarterfinals	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL	ATP250
4927_1	I don't think so.	4927_1.a	2013-01-04	M	4927	Alexandr Dolgopolov	Kei Nishikori	Nothing serious?	4927_1.q	19.0	1	Quarterfinals	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL	ATP250
4927_2	No, it's not that big thing. Just a little tightness.	4927_2.a	2013-01-04	M	4927	Alexandr Dolgopolov	Kei Nishikori	Do you have tendinitis there? Is it chronic pain?	4927_2.q	19.0	1	Quarterfinals	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL	ATP250
4927_3	Yeah, it was good match, I think best match this week. He had a good serve and good return. I was struggling a little bit after his return, but he was making a lot of the good returns. But, yeah, I'm very happy the way I played, really offensive, aggressive, and using my forehand. So I'm looking forward to play next match.	4927_3.a	2013-01-04	M	4927	Alexandr Dolgopolov	Kei Nishikori	How do you feel like you're playing overall? Obviously he's a good player.	4927_3.q	19.0	1	Quarterfinals	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL	ATP250
4927_4	Yeah, he could be next No.1 player so it's going to be tough. I think I lost couple times, three or four times, against him. He always play good. He doesn't give me easy points. You know, hopefully I play good and aggressive and try to go to net more often. Yeah, hopefully play good.	4927_4.a	2013-01-04	M	4927	Alexandr Dolgopolov	Kei Nishikori	There is a chance you could play Andy Murray in the next match. What would you feel going in against the US Open champion?	4927_4.q	19.0	1	Quarterfinals	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL	ATP250
4927_5	Yeah, it's going to be a big step year for me. Try to get top 10 hopefully and stay healthy and stay strong. That's the goal for this year.	4927_5.a	2013-01-04	M	4927	Alexandr Dolgopolov	Kei Nishikori	You're 23 now. Do you consider this year to be very big for you in your career?	4927_5.q	19.0	1	Quarterfinals	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL	ATP250
4927_6	Yeah, I think so. My serve is getting better, getting stronger. I think I have five aces today, so that's good enough for me. Yeah, everything was solid today. It's just first week of the tour, but it's looking good.	4927_6.a	2013-01-04	M	4927	Alexandr Dolgopolov	Kei Nishikori	Do you feel like your game is where you want it to be? It is close?	4927_6.q	19.0	1	Quarterfinals	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL	ATP250
4927_7	Yeah, not big deal for me yet. My next goal to get semis in a Grand Slam. I did good last year Australian Open, so, yeah, that's my next goal, to get to semis.	4927_7.a	2013-01-04	M	4927	Alexandr Dolgopolov	Kei Nishikori	Knowing that Rafa is not going to Melbourne, does that put a bit of a spring in your step knowing there is one less of the big four there blocking everyone's path to potentially the semifinals?	4927_7.q	19.0	1	Quarterfinals	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL	ATP250
4927_8	Yeah. But, you know, I don't have good serve like Raonic or some other guys, so I know I have to run a lot. I play like, you know, David Ferrer, get every ball and try not to less unforced errors. That's how I have to play, I think. So, you know, at the same time I want to be aggressive and using my forehand and try to come to net more often. Yeah, that's the next step.	4927_8.a	2013-01-04	M	4927	Alexandr Dolgopolov	Kei Nishikori	You were saying that your serve has improved. Is one of the things you're working on trying to be more offensive so you're not having to run all the time and playing defense a lot?	4927_8.q	19.0	1	Quarterfinals	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL	ATP250
4927_9	Yeah, I hope so. Raonic is almost there, almost to top 10. For me, I haven't beat those guys yet, top four guys. Yeah, it's important to play with those guys and to try to win, you know. That's big step for us, you know.	4927_9.a	2013-01-04	M	4927	Alexandr Dolgopolov	Kei Nishikori	So do you think that your generation of players, Dolgopolov, Raonic, and Tomic, maybe this year you guys can take the step where you can really challenge Federer and Nadal and Djokovic and Murray?	4927_9.q	19.0	1	Quarterfinals	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL	ATP250
4927_10	I don't know. Experience for sure. They really smart in how they play. They take all the important points and they have good accuracy of serves, good ace. I don't know. If you can have a little more experience and a little more aggressive, then I think we have some chance.	4927_10.a	2013-01-04	M	4927	Alexandr Dolgopolov	Kei Nishikori	What do you think is separating them from you guys?	4927_10.q	19.0	1	Quarterfinals	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL	ATP250
6441_0	It's of course nice to come back. I have still in my mind what happened last year. But, you know, everything depends how I'm going to do this year. (Smiling.)	6441_0.a	2014-06-24	M	6441	Somdev Devvarman	Jerzy Janowicz	Coming back to Wimbledon after how well you did last yeah, how do you feel? Excitement? Pressure? What's the emotion coming back?	6441_0.q	25.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6441_1	I'm a little bit disappointed because actually before the match I felt pretty okay. During the practice I played really good. Today, today I expect from myself a little bit more, but lucky that I pulled it off. We'll see how it's going to be during the next match.	6441_1.a	2014-06-24	M	6441	Somdev Devvarman	Jerzy Janowicz	What were your thoughts on today's victory? You had some periods that were very impressive, and then Devvarman was a very tough opponent. How would you analyze it?	6441_1.q	25.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6441_2	Not on my mind.	6441_2.a	2014-06-24	M	6441	Somdev Devvarman	Jerzy Janowicz	A lot of your ranking right now is built on the semifinal of Wimbledon last year. Does that make you nervous at all?	6441_2.q	25.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6441_3	(Shakes head.)	6441_3.a	2014-06-24	M	6441	Somdev Devvarman	Jerzy Janowicz	No?	6441_3.q	25.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6441_4	Lleyton is really, really good player. He won the Wimbledon, so he has a lot of experience. He's extremely solid. He has a great backhand. He doesn't miss much. He has a really nasty serve. Maybe not that powerful, but it's really accurate. So I'll have to play my best tennis.	6441_4.a	2014-06-24	M	6441	Somdev Devvarman	Jerzy Janowicz	What are your thoughts on facing Lleyton Hewitt next?	6441_4.q	25.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6441_5	What was the toughest part?	6441_5.a	2014-06-24	M	6441	Somdev Devvarman	Jerzy Janowicz	What's been the toughest part of the last 12 months for you? Obviously you had the big result here and not as strong the rest of the year and this year so far.	6441_5.q	25.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6441_6	I lost my skill in Battlefield.	6441_6.a	2014-06-24	M	6441	Somdev Devvarman	Jerzy Janowicz	Yeah.	6441_6.q	25.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6441_7	I lost my ranking a little bit and I had  killing rate was much higher than now. I had 2.2, and now it's 1.8.	6441_7.a	2014-06-24	M	6441	Somdev Devvarman	Jerzy Janowicz	How did you lose your skill on the battlefield?	6441_7.q	25.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6441_8	You have killing statistics and death statistics.	6441_8.a	2014-06-24	M	6441	Somdev Devvarman	Jerzy Janowicz	What do you mean?	6441_8.q	25.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6441_9	Yeah.	6441_9.a	2014-06-24	M	6441	Somdev Devvarman	Jerzy Janowicz	Like a video game?	6441_9.q	25.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6441_10	Yeah, definitely.	6441_10.a	2014-06-24	M	6441	Somdev Devvarman	Jerzy Janowicz	And now you're getting killed more often?	6441_10.q	25.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6441_11	Battlefield.	6441_11.a	2014-06-24	M	6441	Somdev Devvarman	Jerzy Janowicz	Any specific video game that has stat?	6441_11.q	25.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6441_12	Yeah, that's it.	6441_12.a	2014-06-24	M	6441	Somdev Devvarman	Jerzy Janowicz	Oh, just battle field.	6441_12.q	25.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1243_0	Yeah, it's a good start, but season just started.  I have some good matches, but now is tough to say what I'm doing because I'm still in tournament, still in quarterfinal, and we can talk about the start of the season after the Australian Open because you always more what you do.	1243_0.a	2008-01-20	M	1243	Nikolay Davydenko	Mikhail Youzhny	Pretty good start of the season.  How do you assess your game since the beginning of the year?	1243_0.q	14.0	1	4th Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1243_1	I played good today almost everything.  That's why I don't want to tell now what I have to do to beat Nikolay, because we are not last time to play against each other.  And also I don't like to play -- tell everybody what kind of tactic I prefer against players.  That's why -- it's good today.  I beat Nikolay, but, you know, if you play tomorrow, it could happen everything.  That's why today, it's good match for me.	1243_1.a	2008-01-20	M	1243	Nikolay Davydenko	Mikhail Youzhny	Nikolay said he was very upset by your slice.  Do you think it's one of the keys of the match?	1243_1.q	14.0	1	4th Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1243_2	No, Grand Slam is Grand Slam for all players.  No, I cannot say here is relaxed.  No, okay, for me, just four Grand Slams in a year a year.  It's main tournaments I think for all players.  I didn't think any relax or any difference between French Open, Wimbledon or US Open.	1243_2.a	2008-01-20	M	1243	Nikolay Davydenko	Mikhail Youzhny	People talk about this as being the most relaxed Grand Slam, that people are relaxed and confident and happy.  Is that the same for you?  Do you feel very relaxed here?	1243_2.q	14.0	1	4th Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1243_3	Yeah, it may be true, but it is now tough to say something about the year.  It's beginning of the year, and beginning of the year everything could happen.  But if you see last tournaments in the year, also everything could happen. But now it's very tough statistically.  But everybody know is first Grand Slam starting in January.  That's why everybody try to be ready.	1243_3.a	2008-01-20	M	1243	Nikolay Davydenko	Mikhail Youzhny	But sometimes at the start of the year, a surprise player does well here.  It's had a history of someone... .	1243_3.q	14.0	1	4th Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1243_4	No, I really enjoy to play here and I really want to play.  That's why I enjoy, like I say, every point in the game. Now, I like this astrosphere, and that's why maybe looks from outside, it's something happens with me.  But when you good shape or if you have some discomfort or injury or something, when you mind not on court, outside on court, it's very tough to show, you know, good game, good... .	1243_4.a	2008-01-20	M	1243	Nikolay Davydenko	Mikhail Youzhny	You looked very confident on the court, your style of play and right from the start, you looked very pumped.	1243_4.q	14.0	1	4th Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1243_5	You know, it's very tough I think for all players, not only because he's from Russia.  Because actually I don't have full information about this one.  And I know for sure it's really bad for tennis, it's really bad for players.  Now we start to talk about all players, like I said, about all players, the investigation affect the matches or something.  I think is it not true.  And, first of all, it's bad for us, it's bad for tennis.	1243_5.a	2008-01-20	M	1243	Nikolay Davydenko	Mikhail Youzhny	Nikolay is your Davis Cup teammate.  Has it been difficult to watch what's been happening away from the court with him with the investigation?	1243_5.q	14.0	1	4th Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1243_6	I know him long time already.  I remember him when he play like two, three years ago.  After I think he had some injury. But he improve a lot.  Last year he play very well in Bercy, I think.  He was in fourth round or third round, I don't remember.  And here he play really well.  He beat good, very good players.  You know, first round he beat Murray.  Today he beat Gasquet.  He played very well, what I saw by TV.	1243_6.a	2008-01-20	M	1243	Nikolay Davydenko	Mikhail Youzhny	What do you know about Jo-Wilfried Tsonga?	1243_6.q	14.0	1	4th Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1243_7	You know, I have to into court and try to show hundred percent what I can do from my game.  And after we'll see if it will be enough to beat Tsonga, as well.  If not...	1243_7.a	2008-01-20	M	1243	Nikolay Davydenko	Mikhail Youzhny	What do you fear in his game?	1243_7.q	14.0	1	4th Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
2431_0	Yeah, it didn't only look dramatic, it was dramatic, because I had the problem with my knee already in Madrid this year, before Paris, and I didn't play for nine or ten days before Roland Garros. I was able to play there. Made two rounds, you know. After Roland Garros, I twist my ankle, two days after the match when I played a challenger tournament in Prostejov. So I started to practice already three or four days here before Wimbledon. Today at 6-5 it was I think on the breakpoint, when I had a breakpoint, David served a double-fault, and I was just hitting the ball back. When I hit the ball, I felt in the knee something is wrong. But I went to the chair, came back to serve, and already the first serve, my knee didn't respond with me, just broke down. When I tried to serve at 15-All, I couldn't even stand on the leg, so I had to stop and call the physio. It happened to me already I think twice, so I knew where the problem is. There was only the question if they gonna tape my knee and, you know, it's gonna -- the pain's gonna go away or not. I gave myself, you know, if I'm gonna finish the set, the whole set with the pain, then I'm gonna retire. But slowly the pain was leaving. I was able to play with the tape. It was actually very uncomfortable, but, you know, I was able to play. And that was for me the most important thing. And I was trying to do most of it.	2431_0.a	2009-06-27	M	2431	David Ferrer	Radek Stepanek	We thought you were going to retire, but you managed to get on.	2431_0.q	23.0	1	3rd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
2431_1	Hopefully, yes. I just called my doctor, if he can show up tonight right away and try to help me out, you know, to get ready for my match. I believe he can help me out, and I'll be ready to battle again.	2431_1.a	2009-06-27	M	2431	David Ferrer	Radek Stepanek	How confident are you you'll be okay for your next match?	2431_1.q	23.0	1	3rd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
2431_2	From Prague.	2431_2.a	2009-06-27	M	2431	David Ferrer	Radek Stepanek	Where is your doctor coming from?	2431_2.q	23.0	1	3rd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
2431_3	I think Lleyton is playing great tennis right now, especially here in Wimbledon. He won it here, so definitely he's got his best experiences. It's gonna be a tough match. He's a great returner. He's passing great. So it will be an exciting match.	2431_3.a	2009-06-27	M	2431	David Ferrer	Radek Stepanek	How do you feel about Lleyton Hewitt as an opponent?	2431_3.q	23.0	1	3rd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
2431_4	Yeah, definitely. If you're not hundred percent fit, then he's gonna make you run like a horse. So I rather try to do everything possible to be hundred percent ready for the match.	2431_4.a	2009-06-27	M	2431	David Ferrer	Radek Stepanek	Is he particularly difficult if you're not fully fit?	2431_4.q	23.0	1	3rd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
2431_5	Yeah, I think, you know, a lot of players aren't playing with the Bosworth racquet. A lot of players also in the past, you know, they also customized the racquets. So many of the top players in the world been customized by Bosworth and they try to produce their own racquet. You know, last year, before the season started, before the off-season, I got the racquet from my coach, Petr Korda and Ivan Lendl, who is playing with the racquet right now, just to try it, just to see if maybe I'm fine with it. And, you know, I felt great with the racquet, and the service are producing is incredibly professional. Everything what I need to change it's done immediately. I feel great with the racquet, you know. I'm not playing tennis just because how the racquet looks, but how it feels. That's the most important thing for me.	2431_5.a	2009-06-27	M	2431	David Ferrer	Radek Stepanek	Most of the players play with racquets from the major manufacturers. You play with a different racquet. Could you tell us about that and why?	2431_5.q	23.0	1	3rd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
2431_6	You know, I already changed it three times this year. I started with one racquet in Australia, then I took for indoors a lighter one, because the tennis is much faster and I needed to be faster with my hands. So that's why I change it. And now when I played on the clay, then it was again too light. Then we gain some weight. So we are working with the racquet all the time. And that's the great advantage to work with them because they are professional. They've been in the tennis for so many years. You know, the knowledge about the racquet is huge from them. I'm very happy and honored that I can be part of it.	2431_6.a	2009-06-27	M	2431	David Ferrer	Radek Stepanek	What is the key element that they've customized for you?	2431_6.q	23.0	1	3rd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
2431_7	Yeah, definitely. You know, we are definitely both, I believe, focused on what we are doing here in Wimbledon. But definitely once this is over, next thing for us is the Davis Cup where we definitely want to do everything possible to go to semis.	2431_7.a	2009-06-27	M	2431	David Ferrer	Radek Stepanek	You and Tomas are doing very well in this tournament. Does this give you a lot of confidence for the next Davis Cup tie?	2431_7.q	23.0	1	3rd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
2431_8	You know, my knee problem happened just during today's match, so it didn't bother me before the tournament. I had a problem with my twisted ankle. I'm very happy that I'm in the fourth round. You know, getting to the second week of Wimbledon is always a nice thing. I'm gonna do everything possible to win another match.	2431_8.a	2009-06-27	M	2431	David Ferrer	Radek Stepanek	Did you expect to get to the fourth round taking into account your knee problem?	2431_8.q	23.0	1	3rd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
2431_9	It's a pain only when I'm serving. When I toss the ball and I have to put all my weight on the left leg and hold it for a little bit, then the knee just switch off and I don't have the power in it. The leg looks like I'm not controlling it. So that was the problem. But since it got taped, it got tightened up, then it didn't -- I'm not a doctor, but just figuring out that once it's tighten up, then the knee is not moving that much maybe. The pain was going slowly away. But it took three, four games when I was not hundred percent.	2431_9.a	2009-06-27	M	2431	David Ferrer	Radek Stepanek	What is the problem? You say the knee gave way. Something you didn't suffer before. It's a pain?	2431_9.q	23.0	1	3rd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
2431_10	Definitely.	2431_10.a	2009-06-27	M	2431	David Ferrer	Radek Stepanek	If you win this tennis tournament, will you do the worm for us?	2431_10.q	23.0	1	3rd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
5752_0	No, I think we know the team already, and we're going to play. I played three time good match against him, but I'm not thinking I gonna be on the team.	5752_0.a	2014-10-29	M	5752	Roger Federer	Jeremy Chardy	With how well you have played against Roger this year in the three matches, do you think you'd be a good pick for Davis Cup, trying to find the best French player to matchup against him?	5752_0.q	30.0	0	2nd Round	BNP PARIBAS MASTERS	Masters 1000
5752_1	I think that atmosphere was nice. I think I start really well the match. I was really aggressive. He was not so ready at the beginning, so I get 30; after it was a good fight. I didn't miss so much, but the first game in the third set. But against a good player like this, more mistake and you lost the match.	5752_1.a	2014-10-29	M	5752	Roger Federer	Jeremy Chardy	And lastly, when you have one of these close matches against him, how much does the indoor environment here change the intensity of the match?	5752_1.q	30.0	0	2nd Round	BNP PARIBAS MASTERS	Masters 1000
5752_2	I played a very good match. I was able to do everything I wanted to do today and I had opportunities. Even when I was broken back I didn't play a bad game. He was just a little bit better than I was today. I think that was the difference.	5752_2.a	2014-10-29	M	5752	Roger Federer	Jeremy Chardy	How do you react after a match like this, a great match?	5752_2.q	30.0	0	2nd Round	BNP PARIBAS MASTERS	Masters 1000
5752_3	When you win the first set of course it changes, but if I had won that first set I might have lost the second. So you never know. That's just the way the match was. Even if I had won the first set he wouldn't have given up, of course. He would have tried to find solutions to be able to win. I can't think that way.	5752_3.a	2014-10-29	M	5752	Roger Federer	Jeremy Chardy	52, set point, do you believe what happened there had no incidence for the rest of the match?	5752_3.q	30.0	0	2nd Round	BNP PARIBAS MASTERS	Masters 1000
5752_4	Well, in the beginning I was very aggressive from the start and I felt that he was not reacting quickly. He was a bit slow. So this helped me make a break at the beginning. But it's been several times I have been playing against the top players, and I know the beginning of a match is always important. Because if you don't play well from the start, then it becomes much more complicated. So I'm happy that I started that way, but he was trying to find solutions. I think he did that very quickly, unfortunately. But I didn't give up. I tried to stay in there, and I believe the fight was good to watch.	5752_4.a	2014-10-29	M	5752	Roger Federer	Jeremy Chardy	But we felt he was taking time to get into that match. Did you feel he was improving with the match?	5752_4.q	30.0	0	2nd Round	BNP PARIBAS MASTERS	Masters 1000
5752_5	All the matches are difficult to win, and I think he has many goals for this end of season. He has more goals than anybody else. You might want to ask a question to him about that. But he's used to have a lot of goals, a lot of pressure. He has always been up to the expectations, and I think he's able to manage the situation. If he thinks it's too much he wouldn't do it. So I think if he chose to do that, it's because he feels he's able to do it.	5752_5.a	2014-10-29	M	5752	Roger Federer	Jeremy Chardy	He's playing a lot of events right now. How did you feel he was playing?	5752_5.q	30.0	0	2nd Round	BNP PARIBAS MASTERS	Masters 1000
5752_6	Yes. I think it was something I was missing if I wanted to become better and be ranked at a higher level. We are working on this with my coach. I do that better and better during matches right now, but I need to work on that even during the off period. I hope next year will be better at the net and that it will help me win more matches and beat better players.	5752_6.a	2014-10-29	M	5752	Roger Federer	Jeremy Chardy	You have been going up to the net, like in Valencia against Robredo. Is this a change in your game that is there to stay?	5752_6.q	30.0	0	2nd Round	BNP PARIBAS MASTERS	Masters 1000
4212_0	Yeah, I mean, the best things that I want compared to Tokyo were nothing what I did today. I mean, in the beginning it was very close, every game when we played, and it was very tough to keep my serve in the second game. Then just wait and have some good returns. I mean, I improve my serve compared to first serve in Tokyo. Yeah, I mean, I didn't have little mistakes what I did in Tokyo, and I tried to play my game.	4212_0.a	2012-09-29	F	4212	Daniela Hantuchova	Petra Kvitova	I think your performance here today is much better than what you had in Tokyo tournament. In which area did you make some changes?	4212_0.q	5.0	1	1st Round	CHINA OPEN	Premier
4212_1	Yeah, I remember last year I played night session also. It was much colder than tonight. That's why I had the pants. I mean, it's not very comfortable, but it's same for both of us on the court. I try to be still moving and be warm.	4212_1.a	2012-09-29	F	4212	Daniela Hantuchova	Petra Kvitova	It's very much cold in the night of Beijing. Do you think that will influence your performance?	4212_1.q	5.0	1	1st Round	CHINA OPEN	Premier
4212_2	Well, I think the opponent will be in the second round now, so we will see. I'm not sure who I'm playing, so that's surprise for me. (Smiling.)	4212_2.a	2012-09-29	F	4212	Daniela Hantuchova	Petra Kvitova	Do you think what will be the single largest potential opponent for you to find before you're gonna reach the title?	4212_2.q	5.0	1	1st Round	CHINA OPEN	Premier
4212_3	Sorry?	4212_3.a	2012-09-29	F	4212	Daniela Hantuchova	Petra Kvitova	Did that match go exactly how you would have wanted it to?	4212_3.q	5.0	1	1st Round	CHINA OPEN	Premier
4212_4	Against her?	4212_4.a	2012-09-29	F	4212	Daniela Hantuchova	Petra Kvitova	Did the match go exactly how you would have hoped?	4212_4.q	5.0	1	1st Round	CHINA OPEN	Premier
4212_5	Well, I mean, I don't care if I will play three sets and I won. That doesn't matter for me. But it's good I didn't spend plenty of time on the court in the night and in the cold. So, I mean, yeah, it's better to play only two sets and win.	4212_5.a	2012-09-29	F	4212	Daniela Hantuchova	Petra Kvitova	Yeah. You won in straight sets, 62, 63. Is that the best start?	4212_5.q	5.0	1	1st Round	CHINA OPEN	Premier
2840_0	Um, I mean, I thought as long as I try, keep trying, I'll have to make one. Because I think all of the ones I tried before she got to, so I think there were two there that were really important, which was the one where, the one she got to, the one that dropped in and I finished off with the forehand winner down the line. Then the next one was obviously the probably most important one where I broke. Yeah, I mean, you know, I don't know. I mean, it's instinct when you decide to do that, and it worked. I mean, it worked. It was an important point, and I'm happy to get through.	2840_0.a	2010-09-10	F	2840	Venus Williams	Kim Clijsters	Could you talk about the backhand topspin lob and your decision to hit that shot there?	2840_0.q	3.0	1	Semifinals	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2840_1	Yeah, and you can also put a little bit more behind it, because I was hitting against the wind at that time. You can really hit a little bit more -- a little harder than I would usually do, and little flatter, as well. Normally I would like to hit it with more topspin, but here I could just really hit it up and even a little flatter than what I would probably do if there was no wind.	2840_1.a	2010-09-10	F	2840	Venus Williams	Kim Clijsters	Were you thinking about the wind on that shot? Were you thinking it might sit up in the wind a little bit?	2840_1.q	3.0	1	Semifinals	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2840_2	Was I up 5-2 in the second?	2840_2.a	2010-09-10	F	2840	Venus Williams	Kim Clijsters	It was such a roller coaster. You're up 5-2 in the second, and then she storms back; 4-2 in the third, and she storms back. What's going through your head as...	2840_2.q	3.0	1	Semifinals	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2840_3	Yeah, but not 5-2.	2840_3.a	2010-09-10	F	2840	Venus Williams	Kim Clijsters	You were up in the second, right, when she came back?	2840_3.q	3.0	1	Semifinals	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2840_4	No.5-3, maybe.	2840_4.a	2010-09-10	F	2840	Venus Williams	Kim Clijsters	5-3. I will check my notes.	2840_4.q	3.0	1	Semifinals	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2840_5	You're right. (Laughter.)	2840_5.a	2010-09-10	F	2840	Venus Williams	Kim Clijsters	You were up a break. You were up 5-2.	2840_5.q	3.0	1	Semifinals	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2840_6	I guess I wasn't thinking. There's my answer. I wasn't thinking about the score, obviously. It was a lot tougher to serve on this side of the court, so, you know, I was obviously -- I'm happy to hold my serve on this side of the court, because I was seeing the ball well on my return games. I felt I could really put more pressure on my return games when she was on that side. So as long as I felt that I could hold, which wasn't the case at 4-All, but I was able to break her on the easier service side. So that was the big game there, and I think that's probably, to me, where, okay, I gave myself the game to finish it off, which was a lot easier on that side of the court.	2840_6.a	2010-09-10	F	2840	Venus Williams	Kim Clijsters	So I guess you were thinking...	2840_6.q	3.0	1	Semifinals	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2840_7	No, I don't think so. Obviously -- um, not wind-wise. No, I don't think so. But obviously there's heat. You know, in Australia, I mean, you play some really tough matches, but now these days they close the roof and it's really hard. So you don't deal with it that much. So, no, I think the conditions have been really tough. I think that's why I was very happy with the level that we played today.	2840_7.a	2010-09-10	F	2840	Venus Williams	Kim Clijsters	Can you remember a more challenging Grand Slam in terms of conditions, wind?	2840_7.q	3.0	1	Semifinals	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2840_8	Yeah, obviously when you hit with the wind you have to just put a little bit -- you're able to just kind of let that arm flow a little bit more where you have to hit with more spin. That's what I was trying to do. Obviously if you can just go to the lines a little bit, even if it's with more spin, the impact on your opponent is, you know, a lot tougher than it is when you're hitting against the wind. So against the wind you just try to hit a little lower over the net, hit it flat, and you can just kind of go for it a little bit more, really go all out and kind of wind up your rotation and just kind of swing from there. That's what I was able to do.	2840_8.a	2010-09-10	F	2840	Venus Williams	Kim Clijsters	How hard is it to fine tune your game every two games? You cross the net and you have to make fine changes in what you do with the ball.	2840_8.q	3.0	1	Semifinals	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2840_9	Yeah, the hard thing, too, was I think the wind wasn't just coming from the back of the court to the front. It was kind of coming sideways. That's tough moving-wise, as well. You kind of just have to always be on your tippy toes and make sure that you adjust and even step forward, step backwards. That's never that easy. But I mean, I felt that I was hitting well with the wind. I felt that I was, you know, making her move around well. I think that's what I was really trying to focus on.	2840_9.a	2010-09-10	F	2840	Venus Williams	Kim Clijsters	Takes away the instinct from a player. You can't just react. You have to factor in what you've already made your mind up, the way the wind is blowing, think about it.	2840_9.q	3.0	1	Semifinals	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2840_10	Um, I mean, it obviously means a lot to be in the final and to give myself a chance to defend my title from last year. It's a great opportunity. But, um, obviously beating Venus here last year and this year, it's a good feeling knowing that -- you know, I think today was probably one of the best matches that I've played throughout the tournament. So, you know, I was able to raise my level, and that's probably what I'm most pleased about, is obviously that I was able to win a close match like this, but that I was able to kind of rise on the occasion when I had to.	2840_10.a	2010-09-10	F	2840	Venus Williams	Kim Clijsters	How do you feel to be in the finals again? What does it mean that you had to get through Venus Williams?	2840_10.q	3.0	1	Semifinals	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2840_11	I don't know. I don't know. I mean, I always feel good here, so I know that if I play good tennis and if, you know, I can give myself an opportunity to get into that second week and play those big matches -- I mean, this is where I've played some of the best tennis that I've ever played. So if I can give myself those opportunities to play these kind of matches and not get, you know, surprised by opponents in the beginning of the tournament, you know, anything is possible. But what we call this year, I don't know. I'm sure you guys will make up something. (Laughter.)	2840_11.a	2010-09-10	F	2840	Venus Williams	Kim Clijsters	Last year your run here was unexpected and incredibly sweet. What is it this year?	2840_11.q	3.0	1	Semifinals	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2840_12	Venus or Zvonareva?	2840_12.a	2010-09-10	F	2840	Venus Williams	Kim Clijsters	What are your memories from your first match against her back in '01, and how different of a player are you?	2840_12.q	3.0	1	Semifinals	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2840_13	Venus. In '01?	2840_13.a	2010-09-10	F	2840	Venus Williams	Kim Clijsters	Against Venus.	2840_13.q	3.0	1	Semifinals	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2840_14	Oh, really? I don't even remember that. Obviously, I mean, the thing is when I was younger, almost 10 years younger, the impact of the powerful strokes was something that was a lot more powerful at the time obviously because we weren't used to that. I played juniors when I was 13, 14. So then all of a sudden you're playing against Venus, Serena, you know, big girls. And girls -- even Lindsay Davenport, those kind of players. The level is so different and the way they hit their strokes. So that was probably my biggest surprise or the biggest change that I noticed from when I came on tour, was how hard they hit it. You know, they still had moments in there where they made some unforced errors because they sometimes like to go for too much as well. But at that time I wasn't able to deal with it because it was just kind of overwhelming. Now, you know, obviously I've become stronger since then physically, and you learn how to deal with them. We've played, I don't know what they said, 12 times or 13 times now. You obviously know and you get to know your opponents, as well. So that always helps.	2840_14.a	2010-09-10	F	2840	Venus Williams	Kim Clijsters	You were taped up, I remember.	2840_14.q	3.0	1	Semifinals	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2840_15	Well, to me, what I like the most is that I see well. I see a lot better, obviously. You don't have to worry with the sun on one side or, you know, interfering with, you know, serves or... So that's something that you can just -- the blue, it's a good blue. You can -- the yellow stands out well, and I think that's something to me that, yeah, I enjoy that more. I can just really focus on the ball a lot better. So that's something that obviously is an advantage for me, I think. Yeah, and the night matches, too. They're special. The crowd gets into it. Even tonight, I know it wasn't planned as a night match, but it ended up almost being one under the lights and everything. It's fun, and to have the crowd, you know, into it and the support, I mean, there's a different vibe.	2840_15.a	2010-09-10	F	2840	Venus Williams	Kim Clijsters	You have such a great record at night here. You talked earlier in the week about it being a different atmosphere. But how do those differences play into your game, your personality, or whatever?	2840_15.q	3.0	1	Semifinals	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2840_16	No. At one point I'm like -- with the wind you don't even feel like you're sweating because it just dries up straightaway. I think, you know, my shirt normally is soaking wet. I was like, Oh, I'm like Roger Federer; I don't sweat. (Laughter.)	2840_16.a	2010-09-10	F	2840	Venus Williams	Kim Clijsters	Did you feel tired in the third set at all?	2840_16.q	3.0	1	Semifinals	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2840_17	Yeah, I mean, I don't know. Definitely not less. Obviously I think just because of -- you know, I know where I came from. You know, I didn't do anything for a year and a half almost, and just the amount of work that I put in, that's where I look back to. That's where, you know -- that's what me personally -- that's where I like to, you know, not compare, but kind of think back, Okay, this is the amount of work that I've put in. Still, I like to put in a lot of work. I'm probably not the player who practices the most, but I go by feeling. And if I feel good, then I don't feel the need to do too much. These last two weeks I've probably -- my US Open has been completely different these last two weeks than they were last year. Because last year, I mean, I didn't even come out to the courts a few days in between my matches just because, you know, I was hitting the ball well. I was like, Okay, little crazy. I just wanted to be with Jada and with the family, and it was new. Now, you know, here these last two weeks I've been hitting more during off days than I probably would in any Grand Slam just because I never really had that rhythm. So, you know, it's been a little different in that way. You know, I think in a way, yeah, you care more, because the amount of time that I have put in is different now.	2840_17.a	2010-09-10	F	2840	Venus Williams	Kim Clijsters	Compared to when you retired, do you have perspective? You have a child now; you have a daughter. Do you care or do you care more that you're competing for this title? Does winning mean as much as before or less?	2840_17.q	3.0	1	Semifinals	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2840_18	It's fun. Obviously, you know, there's a few people that you focus towards, and they're always there. You know, obviously it's my group, the box. But there's moments when, you know, when it's close and you really get the crowd into it and there's big points. I mean, it's fun. It's fun to play in these kind of situations. I mean, it's a lot more fun than playing at 11:00 with half of the stadium full. Obviously this makes you play better, as well.	2840_18.a	2010-09-10	F	2840	Venus Williams	Kim Clijsters	Were you surprised about how much support you got out there? You're playing an American. Seems to me like you got about 50% of the support.	2840_18.q	3.0	1	Semifinals	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2840_19	Um, I mean, she's very tough opponent. Obviously I've lost my last two matches against her that we've played against each other, so it's gonna be a tough battle. She's a player who doesn't give you much. She's always there, hangs in there. It's not that she has a game that's very unpredictable, but what she does she does extremely well. So it's going to be a lot different match than it was today, I think, just because, you know, she just, yeah, has a really good backhand. She likes to go for it. She's been serving a lot better, you know, in the last few months that I've seen.	2840_19.a	2010-09-10	F	2840	Venus Williams	Kim Clijsters	What are you expecting from Vera tomorrow?	2840_19.q	3.0	1	Semifinals	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
420_0	Yeah, definitely. I thought it was a good match.	420_0.a	2015-05-05	F	420	Elina Svitolina	Ana Ivanovic	This is better than Stuttgart then.	420_0.q	7.0	1	2nd Round	MUTUA MADRID OPEN	Premier
420_1	My approach a little bit to the match. You know, was really some changes. The way I played today I really feel that's my game, and still there were some mistakes that I was not making normally. I feel it's the first match that I really played the way I wanted to play, so that kind of gave my confidence. I knew the mistakes were part of it, so just to go through it and make a lot of winners and be aggressive again, it really gave my lots of confidence.	420_1.a	2015-05-05	F	420	Elina Svitolina	Ana Ivanovic	Pleasing signs of aggression coming back into your game. Talk a little bit about what you think has changed or the last couple weeks.	420_1.q	7.0	1	2nd Round	MUTUA MADRID OPEN	Premier
420_2	Yeah.	420_2.a	2015-05-05	F	420	Elina Svitolina	Ana Ivanovic	Did you feel you had some confidence coming back from such a tight firstround match? Could have gone very badly for you.	420_2.q	7.0	1	2nd Round	MUTUA MADRID OPEN	Premier
420_3	Yeah, definitely. I was really my back against the wall in that first round. She was serving for the match at 65. I thought it was not really great quality match from me, so to break through that one and then back it up with a better performance and better setup of the points and different style of the game, for me, that was big step.	420_3.a	2015-05-05	F	420	Elina Svitolina	Ana Ivanovic	Did that give you a lot more confidence coming into this one?	420_3.q	7.0	1	2nd Round	MUTUA MADRID OPEN	Premier
420_4	Yeah, definitely. You know, after the firstround win, last few days I had time to a little bit think about my game and strategy and practice this a little bit more, sort of more organized a little bit. I felt more confident going on court, and I knew whatever happened I was on the right path. Having a win and having chances again tomorrow, it really means a lot.	420_4.a	2015-05-05	F	420	Elina Svitolina	Ana Ivanovic	This is your best win in terms of ranking of the year. Do you think that this is the confidence boost that you needed for the rest of the clay season?	420_4.q	7.0	1	2nd Round	MUTUA MADRID OPEN	Premier
420_5	Yeah. I mean, yeah, on the weekend we decided to stop. It was better. Sort of we had a little bit different views of my game. That's what I felt made a big difference today, you know, some adjustments in my game. I felt that today on court it was my real game. It's always tough, but, yeah, sometimes you have to make the tough decisions.	420_5.a	2015-05-05	F	420	Elina Svitolina	Ana Ivanovic	Your coach was not there today. Any problem?	420_5.q	7.0	1	2nd Round	MUTUA MADRID OPEN	Premier
420_6	I have a sparring partner with me. Having what happen in the middle of the season, it's not ideal, so I am going to stick with my sparring partner for the moment and try to sort of work on the experience I have and the way I see my game as well. Then I will try to make a good decision, you know, and not rush.	420_6.a	2015-05-05	F	420	Elina Svitolina	Ana Ivanovic	So you're going to go it alone now for the rest of clay court season?	420_6.q	7.0	1	2nd Round	MUTUA MADRID OPEN	Premier
420_7	Yeah, the thing is I have lots of priorities actually at the moment. I really have to work hard on building up the confidence and game the way I see my game, going in that direction. And also, at the same time, trying to find out and think of the right decision and right way to go. It's really tough. It's middle of the season and you have to make some adjustments. You don't really want to try someone for few months and then that doesn't work out. You really have to be smart about that and not rush into it. Obviously we have some offers and opportunities, so we will see how that goes.	420_7.a	2015-05-05	F	420	Elina Svitolina	Ana Ivanovic	Going to try to get somebody in place for the grass court season? You're defending in Birmingham as well.	420_7.q	7.0	1	2nd Round	MUTUA MADRID OPEN	Premier
420_8	Yeah, it was actually amazing atmosphere. Last few years I played on this court I felt it was not as full as today. Today they were really behind me. Even in the last game I felt everyone kind of excited and nervous. I'm like, okay, guys, just calm down now. I'm nervous enough. But it was great. Great atmosphere. So good to see. Lots of young people as well. That's what motivates us. At the end of the day we're here because of them.	420_8.a	2015-05-05	F	420	Elina Svitolina	Ana Ivanovic	How did you feel the crowd today? There was a full stadium and they were going for you.	420_8.q	7.0	1	2nd Round	MUTUA MADRID OPEN	Premier
420_9	Yeah, it's going to be actually a very different match. I think they are both completely different style of game, and it's going to be tough match playing either. Carla has been playing really well lately and making finals in Miami. You know, she's tough opponent. We had some tough matches in the past, especially the one in Rome last year. So I'm prepared for a very heavy match. On the other hand, Julia is a little bit different. She hits a lot more and there are not as many long rallies as probably with Carla. Just happy to see Carla do well. She's local favorite and a very nice girl. I'm sure we'll see a lot of her in the future.	420_9.a	2015-05-05	F	420	Elina Svitolina	Ana Ivanovic	Your next opponent will be Carl Suarez Navarro or Julia Goerges. Opinions about both? Carla has had an amazing year. She's fifth in the race.	420_9.q	7.0	1	2nd Round	MUTUA MADRID OPEN	Premier
420_10	You know, it's very tough. I had different kinds of experiences with coaches, and not many great ones, to be honest. I really, really have to take it one step at a time and sort of try to talk to people and also try to feel it. Because as a player, once you see the energy on the court as well it makes a big difference.	420_10.a	2015-05-05	F	420	Elina Svitolina	Ana Ivanovic	On the topic of your coach, is there any chance at all that you will turn like a lot of the other professionals to a super coach in the future?	420_10.q	7.0	1	2nd Round	MUTUA MADRID OPEN	Premier
420_11	You know, it's tough to say. I think there are a varieties of things. I want to have a coach who will stay with me until the end of my career. I have a fitness coach for four years, and I had one for three years before that. With my management I been forever. I don't like changes. It just always happens like this, because I always feel there is more that I can achieve and that there is more I can do. I need a person who's going to help me do that be behind me and challenge me as well and not  I think, okay, being a top athlete, you have to be a little bit crazy. You need someone who's going to step up to you on the same level and be inspired and motivated and not happy that you reached third or fourth round. Yeah, so I always try to see if I can do more.	420_11.a	2015-05-05	F	420	Elina Svitolina	Ana Ivanovic	We spoke to you last year after you parted with Nigel and you went on to win; you've switched coaches twice now. You're a nice person. What is it about you that is resulting in you and coaches parting company?	420_11.q	7.0	1	2nd Round	MUTUA MADRID OPEN	Premier
420_12	Yeah, it is tough. I have to rely on myself. Today on court I have no one to blame. I have to look into myself and find answers within myself. It's tough. Some people can do it for longer and some for shorter. I really want to find the right person. Like I said, it's very, very hard because it gets very personal. It's very individual, very onetoone. It does get sometimes too comfortable and people take things for granted. That's also another problem in individual sports. I have to find the line and balance between respect and becoming too personal. So there are so many things that have to come together. It's definitely not easy, and I'm not looking forward to making that decision.	420_12.a	2015-05-05	F	420	Elina Svitolina	Ana Ivanovic	In all seriousness though, do you feel it's making you stronger as a person having to go through the adjustments and changes, especially at this point in your career?	420_12.q	7.0	1	2nd Round	MUTUA MADRID OPEN	Premier
420_13	I respect a lot her for her achievements and for what she achieved. I know she's helping Radwanska. I don't know if she still does. No?	420_13.a	2015-05-05	F	420	Elina Svitolina	Ana Ivanovic	Martina Navratilova and Radwanska broke up. Would you ever consider Navratilova to be your coach? Do you think she would bring anything to your game?	420_13.q	7.0	1	2nd Round	MUTUA MADRID OPEN	Premier
420_14	I haven't really thought about it. But then again, the question your colleague asked, will you go that way to get someone who has already been up there or someone who's young and motivated and has knowledge of the game. So it's very, very hard decision. At the moment, honestly, I have to put it a little bit on the side and focus on my tournament. Then hopefully over next few weeks we'll think a little more.	420_14.a	2015-05-05	F	420	Elina Svitolina	Ana Ivanovic	No.	420_14.q	7.0	1	2nd Round	MUTUA MADRID OPEN	Premier
420_15	It's so hard. Obviously would be someone who can sort of work with me until the end of my career. You know, there are so many things that have to come together. You have to be really compatible on the court. Someone who can push me, you know. Also, like I spoke before, this person really needs to be strong and not be afraid to say, Look, you're not doing well. There are many things we don't do well. So not someone who's going to mask everything and say it's perfect. Someone who is going to step up and say, Work on this and this and this if you want to win these tournaments. That's the fact. Because we all have room for improvement.	420_15.a	2015-05-05	F	420	Elina Svitolina	Ana Ivanovic	Who would be ideal if you could have anyone in the world?	420_15.q	7.0	1	2nd Round	MUTUA MADRID OPEN	Premier
4928_0	Yeah, it was a decent match. There was a few long rallies. It was quite a tough time of day to play on this court because of the shadows. It's quite hard to track the ball sometimes. So it was sort of 20minute period where both of us were struggling with timing a little bit. But for the most part, it was pretty good quality. He served well for the majority of the first set, and especially well at the beginning the second. So I didn't really have that many chances on returns, so I needed to serve well today. That helped.	4928_0.a	2013-01-04	M	4928	Denis Istomin	Andy Murray	Held your serve throughout. I guess that's a pretty good match if you don't get broken, I guess.	4928_0.q	3.0	1	Quarterfinals	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL	ATP250
4928_1	Well, yeah, like I said, I was finding it quite tough to track the ball. I had a couple of opportunities and just mishit shots that I wouldn't normally mishit. You want to, if you can, finish matches off in two sets. I had a little opportunity there at the end of the second which I didn't take, so I was frustrated with that because I wasn't timing the ball as I would have liked. But I managed to stay focused in the tiebreak and played a good breaker.	4928_1.a	2013-01-04	M	4928	Denis Istomin	Andy Murray	Looked like a little bit ever frustration out there in the second set getting up to the tiebreaker. Step us through that.	4928_1.q	3.0	1	Quarterfinals	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL	ATP250
4928_2	No, I mean, it happens at a lot of different tournaments. It's just the nature of playing at that time of day really. US Open you get it basically when the sun is coming down over the stadium and half the court is in shadow and half is in sun. It's hard to track the ball when it's coming in and out of different lights. It's on the serve as well, you know, and the crowd, too. So there are a lot of things that can sort of throw your eye off a little bit. In tennis, a split second makes a big difference. No, I don't think they need to reschedule matches, it's just a tricky time to play.	4928_2.a	2013-01-04	M	4928	Denis Istomin	Andy Murray	Is it particularly bad at one end over the other? Is it an issue of maybe they shouldn't be scheduled at that time?	4928_2.q	3.0	1	Quarterfinals	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL	ATP250
4928_3	"Some years I have; this year I didn't really feel that way. I started off my match yesterday very well. It's just more rather than being rusty it's just getting the intensity back. When you're practicing it's hard replicate match situations. You don't have those nerves on the break points or 30All points or the end of sets. You don't have that in practice, and they're the things that take a while to get back into the rhythm of playing. But ""rusty"" wouldn't be the word I would use to describe it normally. I play loads and loads of sets in Miami to build up for it. Yeah, rusty isn't one of the ways I've been feeling this week."	4928_3.a	2013-01-04	M	4928	Denis Istomin	Andy Murray	Given how much you play throughout the year for your lives, are you legitimately rusty going into every new season? Do you feel like, Oh, I haven't played in forever?	4928_3.q	3.0	1	Quarterfinals	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL	ATP250
4928_4	Yeah, especially yesterday. It's just different. Obviously coming over here, you know, a lot players it's a long trip to get over. Takes more than two, three days. Takes a week, ten days before you're feeling absolutely perfect after that. Yeah, start of the new year you have a few aches and pains playing the matches. They go away relatively quickly.	4928_4.a	2013-01-04	M	4928	Denis Istomin	Andy Murray	Probably hurts quite a bit when you start playing matches again.	4928_4.q	3.0	1	Quarterfinals	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL	ATP250
4928_5	Yeah, I played him last year in Melbourne, and I think I also played him in Shanghai a couple years ago. I practice with him quite a bit as well. He was very tired going into the match in Melbourne. He had two or three five setters in a row and was struggling a bit physically that day. But he's playing really well. He won the tournament in Tokyo at the end of last year and probably gained some confidence from that. That was his biggest win to date. He's obviously played some good tennis this week.	4928_5.a	2013-01-04	M	4928	Denis Istomin	Andy Murray	You played Nishikori in Melbourne?	4928_5.q	3.0	1	Quarterfinals	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL	ATP250
4928_6	Yeah, it was important. I mean, the matches that are hardest to get over are the ones where you go out and don't play well and don't feel like you've done yourself justice. That's when it's taken me a solid amount of time to get over that. Like when I lost to him in the final in the Aussie Open and didn't feel like I played particularly well, I struggled for a few months after that with motivation and I was very disappointed. Last year it wasn't the case. I played finals in Miami and final in Dubai as well, and had some good wins. I beat Novak in Dubai, so I played well after that. Yeah, it was a good start to the year for me because I played not just in that match, but I played well here and in the four or five matches before I played Novak in Melbourne.	4928_6.a	2013-01-04	M	4928	Denis Istomin	Andy Murray	That semi you played against Novak last year in Melbourne, how important was that as maybe the tipping point for your faith and a bit of confidence?	4928_6.q	3.0	1	Quarterfinals	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL	ATP250
4928_7	Yeah.	4928_7.a	2013-01-04	M	4928	Denis Istomin	Andy Murray	There was a little bit of grumbling before the Australian Open last year about the prize money and how it's allocated.	4928_7.q	3.0	1	Quarterfinals	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL	ATP250
4928_8	Yeah, I think the problem is when they start changing when I first came on the tour it just basically worked where the first round losers would get $10; second round, $20; third round $40, and just doubles every single round. That seemed to work well, and no one was complaining about how the prize money was allocated. They were just saying they would like more prize money. When more prize money came in and went at the top end, the majority of the players were unhappy with that. I think it's better for the tour as whole if it's balanced up a little better.	4928_8.a	2013-01-04	M	4928	Denis Istomin	Andy Murray	Do you think the increase this year is going to make life a bit more comfortable for players ranked outside of the top 20?	4928_8.q	3.0	1	Quarterfinals	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL	ATP250
4928_9	I'm not sure. I think, to be honest, the issues with tennis go a lot deeper than the ATP Tour. The Challenger Tour prize money hasn't changed in years. Futures tournaments, I don't think their prize money has changed the last 20 to 30 years. That's what is stopping guys playing tennis early rather than the guys that are on the main tour stopping early. It's the guys playing Futures and Challengers where the prize money  you know the $10,000 Futures, that's been the same for I think it's over 25 years. So the problem is not so much with the main tour. It's the smaller events.	4928_9.a	2013-01-04	M	4928	Denis Istomin	Andy Murray	Do you think it'll encourage more people to stay on the tour for longer?	4928_9.q	3.0	1	Quarterfinals	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL	ATP250
4928_10	Well, clearly not because the prize money has stayed the same. I don't know if there are any plans for that to change in the future. But on the main tour, yeah, which is something that I think obviously the players that are playing those events can help control a little bit. Yeah, it's definitely improved over the last couple of years, which definitely helps.	4928_10.a	2013-01-04	M	4928	Denis Istomin	Andy Murray	But the collective power of the players from the top down must be...	4928_10.q	3.0	1	Quarterfinals	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL	ATP250
4928_11	I think there will definitely come a moment when someone is gonna break through. I don't know whether it'll be at the Aussie Open or this year. No one knows. But there will be a time when those guys improve. A lot of them have huge, huge games. There is also variety in the way some of them play. Tomic, I really like the way he plays. I enjoy watching him the most because he plays with a lot of variety. Then you have guys like Raonic who are massive servers and can overpower guys. So there is an opportunity for players to break through. With Rafa not playing as well, that probably enhances that opportunity. But have to wait and see. You never know.	4928_11.a	2013-01-04	M	4928	Denis Istomin	Andy Murray	Do you expect a realistic breakthrough from any of the younger players this year, like Nishikori or Raonic or Tomic? I know there is a lot of talk about it year to year, but none of them have really made the big push like you and Roger and Rafa and Novak did at more or less the same age or younger ages.	4928_11.q	3.0	1	Quarterfinals	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL	ATP250
4928_12	Yes, he did.	4928_12.a	2013-01-04	M	4928	Denis Istomin	Andy Murray	I heard that Jez lost a VersaClimber contest to Lendl; is that right?	4928_12.q	3.0	1	Quarterfinals	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL	ATP250
4928_13	Yeah, probably an 11year age difference. Yeah, they made the bet at the US Open. I guess both of them trained for pretty much three months and then he did it I think on the 10th of December. Yeah, well, you guys will hear about it in Australia, put it that way. One of them has lost a bet.	4928_13.a	2013-01-04	M	4928	Denis Istomin	Andy Murray	That's pretty amazing given Lendl's age.	4928_13.q	3.0	1	Quarterfinals	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL	ATP250
4928_14	Yeah, it kind of changed, but they did ten minutes on. So Jez started ten minutes then Ivan did ten minutes, Jez ten minutes, three times. Yeah, it was basically who went higher. Ivan won fairly comfortably.	4928_14.a	2013-01-04	M	4928	Denis Istomin	Andy Murray	So they did a half hour on the VersaClimber?	4928_14.q	3.0	1	Quarterfinals	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL	ATP250
4928_15	Yeah. He doesn't want to take on challenges that he doesn't know he's going to win. Yeah, that was a good one. Yeah, for his age, he's still in very, very good shape.	4928_15.a	2013-01-04	M	4928	Denis Istomin	Andy Murray	He's still pretty competitive, huh?	4928_15.q	3.0	1	Quarterfinals	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL	ATP250
4928_16	I don't really know, to be honest. A lot of times I get asked sometimes after matches or, you know, can get picked up on the microphone or whatever. No one has mentioned anything to me yet. But the mics at the Aussie Open are all 'round the court, so we'll see.	4928_16.a	2013-01-04	M	4928	Denis Istomin	Andy Murray	There were some quotes a while back about trying to tone down the language on the court maybe. Is that going to plan?	4928_16.q	3.0	1	Quarterfinals	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL	ATP250
4928_17	No. Where it came from was I got asked a question. I was doing an interview over the phone. I got asked about swearing on the court. I said, obviously I don't mean to do it. I don't want to do it. Sometimes you get frustrated and you do. Obviously I will try to stop. I didn't make any promises or guarantees that I was going to. Then it came out that I've said this year I will stop swearing. What I also said was that a lot of players swear on the court and a lot of people say a lot worse things than I say on the court in other languages. It doesn't get picked up on the same. So yeah, where I would obviously love to stop doing it, I try not to, I can't guarantee it.	4928_17.a	2013-01-04	M	4928	Denis Istomin	Andy Murray	Now that you've won a major, does it feel like more after role model thing?	4928_17.q	3.0	1	Quarterfinals	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL	ATP250
4325_0	Well, I know in the first set he just played  you know, his level just, he just wasn't there. He was missing almost every single ball. And then just completely 360ed from there. I guess I had those two break points at 1540 in the first game on his serve in the second set. He held that game, and then I got broken the next game. After that, it was just you can call it a disaster, I guess. Yeah, it wasn't a very good performance on my part.	4325_0.a	2012-08-06	M	4325	Matthew Ebden	Peter Polansky	You cruised through the first set pretty easily, and then things went downhill from there. What happened? What changed?	4325_0.q	157.0	0	1st Round	ROGERS CUP MEN	Masters
4325_1	Yeah, it's very frustrating, especially having a big tournament like this, such a great opportunity. Not just playing in the tournament, but the draw that I had, just so many chances to be had. Just wasn't able to perform today. It's frustrating because it happened last week as well where I was up a set and almost a break, and then the match just turned around a little bit from there. But you got to move on and hopefully learn from this.	4325_1.a	2012-08-06	M	4325	Matthew Ebden	Peter Polansky	How frustrating is it to have that happen here in your own backyard basically?	4325_1.q	157.0	0	1st Round	ROGERS CUP MEN	Masters
4325_2	Yeah, obviously crowd wasn't as big as two years ago. I didn't really think about that. I was just right from the start going out there trying to play my game. I was pretty focused. You know, I did have the crowd behind me in the beginning, and then the match went on and it wasn't great tennis, so I think some of the people weren't as excited into it. But I didn't let their behavior dictate my play.	4325_2.a	2012-08-06	M	4325	Matthew Ebden	Peter Polansky	Two years ago you knock off Jurgen Melzer here. The crowd really got behind you in that match. Was it different today being a day match? Did you feel the same kind of support?	4325_2.q	157.0	0	1st Round	ROGERS CUP MEN	Masters
4325_3	Well, if I watch this match I'll probably say everything. But normally I play pretty well and I've been playing well this year, so just very disappointed how this match turned out. I still need to work on just being more consistent. Not from the groundstrokes, but just my level of play and being able to keep up my good level for three, four matches in a row. I think it's important also just work on those bigger points. Got to be able to convert those bigger points. Like at 60, 1540, if I converted one break point I would have been up a break and whole different story. Maybe he would have kept playing the way he was. I think it's just more playing lots of matches and working on closing out those important games.	4325_3.a	2012-08-06	M	4325	Matthew Ebden	Peter Polansky	What parts of your game do you have to maybe work on going forward in your future?	4325_3.q	157.0	0	1st Round	ROGERS CUP MEN	Masters
4325_4	Maybe a little bit. I did get  I wouldn't say nervous. Maybe just a little bit when I got broken in that game in the second set maybe just deflated a little bit and started to think how he was playing. I mean, he was playing pretty poorly and how I missed a shot, that I got broken there, and now I'm down a break in the second set. Anything can happen. I tried to stay in there. Mentally I was fighting, but I just couldn't  for me it seemed like I couldn't put the ball in the court no matter what I was trying to do. Yeah, trying not to think about that right now.	4325_4.a	2012-08-06	M	4325	Matthew Ebden	Peter Polansky	Anything that went on psychologically that hampered you a bit or you started thinking too much or thinking something was wrong? Anything that went on psychologically that you can point to?	4325_4.q	157.0	0	1st Round	ROGERS CUP MEN	Masters
4325_5	Yeah, not that often. It's pretty rare you see a guy who chips his backhand as much as he did. I mean, he wasn't doing much. He was staying low. I thought I was doing an okay job of keeping him back, but I wasn't taking advantage of it in any way. I was letting him do whatever he wanted with his backhand even though it wasn't hurting me. So for sure I could have put more pressure on him with his backhand, on had his backhand side, but I just wasn't feeling anything today after that first set.	4325_5.a	2012-08-06	M	4325	Matthew Ebden	Peter Polansky	How often do you play a guy that hits that many slice backhands to you?	4325_5.q	157.0	0	1st Round	ROGERS CUP MEN	Masters
4325_6	Yeah, I mean, felt good coming off my racquet, but then just seemed to fly a little bit too much. I don't think I missed it by much, maybe a foot or two. I thought for sure I had him on that one.	4325_6.a	2012-08-06	M	4325	Matthew Ebden	Peter Polansky	And the forehand pass in the last game, you had a really good chance to get back on serve there. Would like to have that one back, I guess.	4325_6.q	157.0	0	1st Round	ROGERS CUP MEN	Masters
4325_7	Yeah, his game is okay. His serve is okay. On the deuce side he mixes it up all right; he goes out wide. On the ad side I think he goes mostly T. He hit a couple big ones out wide on the bigger points. From the back I felt like he wasn't able to hurt me. Most of the time it was just me going for too much and just sailing along.	4325_7.a	2012-08-06	M	4325	Matthew Ebden	Peter Polansky	Generally what do you think of his game? It's a little bit different than most guys.	4325_7.q	157.0	0	1st Round	ROGERS CUP MEN	Masters
1515_0	Well, actually, I think it was not about how hard she was hitting the ball. I think it was all about me losing the opportunity, you know, to win the first set. You know, 5-2 leading, serving for the set, had a set point after such a big fight in the tiebreak. Such a great chance, you know, to finish the set. Maybe then I could finish in two sets. But after losing the first set, it was really difficult to come back, stay focused and try to fight, because she started to play with a lot of confidence. Just a tough match.	1515_0.a	2008-11-08	F	1515	Vera Zvonareva	Elena Dementieva	It seems she was hitting the ball maybe harder than you were?	1515_0.q	5.0	0	Semifinals	SONY ERICSSON CHAMPIONSHIPS	SEC
1515_1	Well, I think with Vera, you know, against someone like her who defends very well, who moves very well, you have to put a lot of pressure. You have to hit, you know, as hard as you can. You have to make sure that you stand inside the court and put the pressure all the time, because she is very good, and then she can go very quickly from defense to defense. So I think it was all about me not playing tactically right, you know, against her today. But all respect to her game. I mean, she's playing really well this week.	1515_1.a	2008-11-08	F	1515	Vera Zvonareva	Elena Dementieva	But you won the second set, so you came back well, and then what happened in the third?	1515_1.q	5.0	0	Semifinals	SONY ERICSSON CHAMPIONSHIPS	SEC
1515_2	I didn't want to lose, you know. I mean, for the first time in my career I just feel sad that the season is over. Usually I feel so tired coming to the Championships. But this time I just wanted to play and play. I just didn't want it to be the last match of the season. So it's very disappointing about it.	1515_2.a	2008-11-08	F	1515	Vera Zvonareva	Elena Dementieva	It just seems that you were in a good mood, because we saw you smiling on the court?	1515_2.q	5.0	0	Semifinals	SONY ERICSSON CHAMPIONSHIPS	SEC
1515_3	Well, I think it's quite entertainment for the crowd. I think it's going to be very helpful for the young players because I think during the match, you know, sometimes to have good advice from your coach or from someone who is with you on the tournament, it's very important. But, well, myself, I don't think I'm going to call someone on the court. I think we have plenty of time to talk about everything just before the match. I mean, I can keep it in my head. I don't need a reminder.	1515_3.a	2008-11-08	F	1515	Vera Zvonareva	Elena Dementieva	On another topic, what do you think of on-court coaching, which we're going to be seeing next year, introduced permanently?	1515_3.q	5.0	0	Semifinals	SONY ERICSSON CHAMPIONSHIPS	SEC
1515_4	I don't think many Top 10 players will be using it. But I'm sure a lot of the young generation will, for sure, will ask their coach to come on the court and help them in a difficult moment of the match.	1515_4.a	2008-11-08	F	1515	Vera Zvonareva	Elena Dementieva	Do you think the players generally support the idea?	1515_4.q	5.0	0	Semifinals	SONY ERICSSON CHAMPIONSHIPS	SEC
1515_5	I think I was ready, you know. We played couple of times this year, and I had some positive results against her. I think it was a tight match, you know. Semifinals of the Championship, and I really wanted to make it. So I think she mixed it up a lot. After hitting hard, she was trying to do some slice and change direction a lot of times. So, yeah, I feel like I did some mistakes, but I mean, there is no excuse for me losing the first set still.	1515_5.a	2008-11-08	F	1515	Vera Zvonareva	Elena Dementieva	You lost lot of easy balls. Do you think you were not ready mentally for the game against Vera?	1515_5.q	5.0	0	Semifinals	SONY ERICSSON CHAMPIONSHIPS	SEC
1515_6	I don't want to -- I just want to play tomorrow. No, players' party tonight (laughing). And then just go home. Going to visit my grandparents and stay with my family, and then get ready for the new season.	1515_6.a	2008-11-08	F	1515	Vera Zvonareva	Elena Dementieva	So now, unfortunately, you're on holidays. So what are you going to do?	1515_6.q	5.0	0	Semifinals	SONY ERICSSON CHAMPIONSHIPS	SEC
1515_7	I think I'm going to start in two weeks.	1515_7.a	2008-11-08	F	1515	Vera Zvonareva	Elena Dementieva	Generally, when do you start working again for next season?	1515_7.q	5.0	0	Semifinals	SONY ERICSSON CHAMPIONSHIPS	SEC
1515_8	Well, actually, he's the coach for the Fed Cup and Davis Cup teams. Well, I've known him for a while, so I've asked him to come with me here and help me out this week and the week before in Luxembourg. We'll see how it goes. If he has some time in the new season, he may come with me again.	1515_8.a	2008-11-08	F	1515	Vera Zvonareva	Elena Dementieva	Is Andrei Olhovsky permanently your coach, or is this sort of a test to see how things went?	1515_8.q	5.0	0	Semifinals	SONY ERICSSON CHAMPIONSHIPS	SEC
163_0	Yeah.	163_0.a	2015-01-07	F	163	Kaia Kanepi	Madison Brengle	Tough day. She's obviously very good player.	163_0.q	91.0	0	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL PRESENTED BY SUNCORP	Premier
163_1	Yeah, I mean, got quite a few matches in. That's kind of like the idea playing these is getting as many matches as I can before. So I'm going to Hobart tomorrow. I'm in quallies there. Hopefully get a few more in and then have a good week in Melbourne.	163_1.a	2015-01-07	F	163	Kaia Kanepi	Madison Brengle	You played recently well the last, what, three days more or less?	163_1.q	91.0	0	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL PRESENTED BY SUNCORP	Premier
163_2	Yeah, very.	163_2.a	2015-01-07	F	163	Kaia Kanepi	Madison Brengle	The way she played today she's a good player, huh?	163_2.q	91.0	0	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL PRESENTED BY SUNCORP	Premier
163_3	Mmhmm, in the second I started maybe to return her serve a little bit better. Because she has really, really good first serve. She places it quite well. So the first set I didn't really get that much of a play on most of her first serves. So that was quite tough. The second set was closer because I got more of them back and I could start the point a little better and I finally broke in that set.	163_3.a	2015-01-07	F	163	Kaia Kanepi	Madison Brengle	Second set was very close.	163_3.q	91.0	0	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL PRESENTED BY SUNCORP	Premier
163_4	That was a lot of matches, yeah.	163_4.a	2015-01-07	F	163	Kaia Kanepi	Madison Brengle	You played a ton last year, huh? Almost every week?	163_4.q	91.0	0	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL PRESENTED BY SUNCORP	Premier
163_5	Yeah. No, I had my best like from Wimby on I kind of had my best section tournamentwise. I mean, it was good. I enjoyed it. I was healthy for a longer section than normal, so that was good.	163_5.a	2015-01-07	F	163	Kaia Kanepi	Madison Brengle	Good thing in a way.	163_5.q	91.0	0	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL PRESENTED BY SUNCORP	Premier
163_6	I mean, I had had some injuries and health injuries so I wasn't able to play that well like continuously. It does make a huge difference, yeah.	163_6.a	2015-01-07	F	163	Kaia Kanepi	Madison Brengle	So you're playing much better how? Physically? Mentally?	163_6.q	91.0	0	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL PRESENTED BY SUNCORP	Premier
163_7	Yeah, but, I mean, just some things just start to click. You get older, you get smarter on court. I mean, I'm enjoying being out there, so...	163_7.a	2015-01-07	F	163	Kaia Kanepi	Madison Brengle	But you been playing since you were a kid?	163_7.q	91.0	0	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL PRESENTED BY SUNCORP	Premier
163_8	Just like certain things in the match, working on certain things. Just getting a little bit more solid off the back, not having kind of one side people can pick on as much. Just working on little things in my game that I felt like I needed to do improve on, they got better in the second half of the year.	163_8.a	2015-01-07	F	163	Kaia Kanepi	Madison Brengle	As far as being smarter, what are you doing?	163_8.q	91.0	0	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL PRESENTED BY SUNCORP	Premier
163_9	Yeah, exactly. Yeah.	163_9.a	2015-01-07	F	163	Kaia Kanepi	Madison Brengle	So you know more, basically.	163_9.q	91.0	0	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL PRESENTED BY SUNCORP	Premier
163_10	Mmhmm. Yeah, no it was good. I was very, very happy to end the year there. Around US Open time I saw like, Okay, what do I need pointwise to get main draw of Australia. So that was kind of my goal working from US Open on, and I made it. So, yeah, I was quite happy. I got to stop a little bit early last year, earlier than I thought I was going to. I had to have a small surgery at the end of the year. So I could get that in earlier and have a longer offseason.	163_10.a	2015-01-07	F	163	Kaia Kanepi	Madison Brengle	So overall you're very happy you're top 100 now for the first time? That must be big, huh?	163_10.q	91.0	0	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL PRESENTED BY SUNCORP	Premier
163_11	I had a touch of skin cancer. They had to take that out of my leg. Sunblock is important.	163_11.a	2015-01-07	F	163	Kaia Kanepi	Madison Brengle	What happened there?	163_11.q	91.0	0	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL PRESENTED BY SUNCORP	Premier
163_12	Yeah, it was on the inside of my knee and you're not allowed to run with that. That was about five weeks I couldn't do much.	163_12.a	2015-01-07	F	163	Kaia Kanepi	Madison Brengle	Yeah, I would imagine. How long were you out? Weeks?	163_12.q	91.0	0	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL PRESENTED BY SUNCORP	Premier
163_13	I could walk but they were just like, Be very careful with it. So I felt...	163_13.a	2015-01-07	F	163	Kaia Kanepi	Madison Brengle	Boy, that's rough. Couldn't run around or walk around?	163_13.q	91.0	0	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL PRESENTED BY SUNCORP	Premier
163_14	I hit like stationary, but I don't think my doctor would've been too happy with me if I broke those stitches. Yeah, she did quite a good job. It doesn't look bad.	163_14.a	2015-01-07	F	163	Kaia Kanepi	Madison Brengle	And you couldn't swim?	163_14.q	91.0	0	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL PRESENTED BY SUNCORP	Premier
163_15	Yeah.	163_15.a	2015-01-07	F	163	Kaia Kanepi	Madison Brengle	So when you got to run again, did it feel okay?	163_15.q	91.0	0	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL PRESENTED BY SUNCORP	Premier
163_16	No. It actually was fine. I had a really good offseason. I was Bradenton and I was quite happy.	163_16.a	2015-01-07	F	163	Kaia Kanepi	Madison Brengle	It wasn't, I'm tired, I'm tired?	163_16.q	91.0	0	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL PRESENTED BY SUNCORP	Premier
163_17	No, not really.	163_17.a	2015-01-07	F	163	Kaia Kanepi	Madison Brengle	Do you work with your mom?	163_17.q	91.0	0	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL PRESENTED BY SUNCORP	Premier
163_18	No.	163_18.a	2015-01-07	F	163	Kaia Kanepi	Madison Brengle	Not at all?	163_18.q	91.0	0	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL PRESENTED BY SUNCORP	Premier
163_19	Yeah, she coached me, but she's up in Delaware and she's a coach up there and couldn't really miss that much work to be able to travel with me and stuff. And I train down at Bollettieri's.	163_19.a	2015-01-07	F	163	Kaia Kanepi	Madison Brengle	But she used to...	163_19.q	91.0	0	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL PRESENTED BY SUNCORP	Premier
163_20	(Shaking head no.) Next week I have a friend coming from Hobart and Melbourne. He'll be my coach for the two weeks, so it'll be good.	163_20.a	2015-01-07	F	163	Kaia Kanepi	Madison Brengle	What about your traveling? USTA people or all by yourself?	163_20.q	91.0	0	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL PRESENTED BY SUNCORP	Premier
163_21	Yeah, but I'll have somebody next week and for Melbourne. He was with me up at US Open, and very, very happy he's coming. It will be good to have somebody there with me.	163_21.a	2015-01-07	F	163	Kaia Kanepi	Madison Brengle	That's not going to be easy, though, right? Almost everyone has a coach.	163_21.q	91.0	0	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL PRESENTED BY SUNCORP	Premier
163_22	Right now kind of thinking to be in a better ranking spot for Indian Wells and Miami. Last year I needed a wildcard to get into quallies of Indian Wells, so I would like to be able to play both of those.	163_22.a	2015-01-07	F	163	Kaia Kanepi	Madison Brengle	What is your goal this year overall?	163_22.q	91.0	0	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL PRESENTED BY SUNCORP	Premier
163_23	I haven't actually looked at like what do you need to be for those. I would like to be able to play both of those and not need a wildcard.	163_23.a	2015-01-07	F	163	Kaia Kanepi	Madison Brengle	Top 80? 70s? Maybe 50?	163_23.q	91.0	0	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL PRESENTED BY SUNCORP	Premier
163_24	Yeah, I mean, I definitely didn't get doubles bageled.	163_24.a	2015-01-07	F	163	Kaia Kanepi	Madison Brengle	But you feel like when you're playing the best players you're close to everyone; you're not getting crushed by them.	163_24.q	91.0	0	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL PRESENTED BY SUNCORP	Premier
163_25	Yeah, I'm in there, and every match I play I feel like I'm learning, Okay, what I do need to do to be able to play against this level player or that level player and just keep working on it. That's kind of the fun of it.	163_25.a	2015-01-07	F	163	Kaia Kanepi	Madison Brengle	You're in there.	163_25.q	91.0	0	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL PRESENTED BY SUNCORP	Premier
163_26	Cool. Thank you.	163_26.a	2015-01-07	F	163	Kaia Kanepi	Madison Brengle	Okay. Good luck next week.	163_26.q	91.0	0	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL PRESENTED BY SUNCORP	Premier
4503_0	Yeah, absolutely. It was a really good match. I started a little nervous, but I got things rolling and was able to get a straightset win. I felt really confident out there, especially toward the end, so it was a really good start.	4503_0.a	2012-08-29	M	4503	Benjamin Becker	Ryan Harrison	Did it feel good to get the first round under your belt and advance through fairly routinely and get comfortable on the surface here?	4503_0.q	61.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4503_1	I mean, I think it's definitely beneficial, but it's not like a do or die. But it certainly helps.	4503_1.a	2012-08-29	M	4503	Benjamin Becker	Ryan Harrison	How important is it to win in straight sets early in a slam?	4503_1.q	61.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4503_2	Well, at the beginning I was serving well. That kind of kept me in it. I got down a break early. I wasn't playing great, but I was serving well enough where it was competitive. He gave me a slight chance at 53 serving for the first set. I took it; I broke him. From then on out I was in pretty good control. My nerves let up on me a lot. I was able to swing out and get in control of things after that. I never really got in any trouble. The only service game I was in trouble was 30, double break up in the third. I was in a comfortable position, he played a good game, but I was able to hold anyway and finish it out.	4503_2.a	2012-08-29	M	4503	Benjamin Becker	Ryan Harrison	Can you tell me what you did well.	4503_2.q	61.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4503_3	Obviously you want to, but I've got a really tough opponent next round. I know I can do well and I know I can win this match if I play well. It's going to be not easy, but I'm looking forward to the challenge. It will be fun.	4503_3.a	2012-08-29	M	4503	Benjamin Becker	Ryan Harrison	Do you have a goal for this Open for yourself?	4503_3.q	61.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4503_4	Well, I hit a good running passing shot. It was not an easy shot and I was able to come up with it. Then he missed a couple first serves and I was able to make a few solid returns. I think he doublefaulted on breakpoint. So a buildup of solid returning made him feel like he had to serve better. He missed a few first serves trying to go for too much.	4503_4.a	2012-08-29	M	4503	Benjamin Becker	Ryan Harrison	Looked like Benjamin had momentum when he had that first set point in that first set. What changed at that moment?	4503_4.q	61.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4503_5	I did. I was in the stands actually. I was like 14 or 15 years old. I heard Agassi's whole speech after that match, too.	4503_5.a	2012-08-29	M	4503	Benjamin Becker	Ryan Harrison	Did you watch him beating Agassi here on TV or...	4503_5.q	61.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4503_6	I think everybody in the crowd was tearing up. It was an impressive speech and one heck of a career.	4503_6.a	2012-08-29	M	4503	Benjamin Becker	Ryan Harrison	Was that emotional?	4503_6.q	61.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4503_7	You don't really think about it. Andre's legacy is so extraordinary that I don't think it's defined by that match he played with Benjamin.	4503_7.a	2012-08-29	M	4503	Benjamin Becker	Ryan Harrison	Does it feel weird to play the same guy?	4503_7.q	61.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4503_8	I mean, hearing the good stuff is always exciting. (Smiling.) But I think that those guys have obviously had such extraordinary careers. They've done so well for U.S. tennis. I've got such a long ways to go. Hearing stuff like that doesn't really come into play. I mean, I've never made third round of a slam. After that you got to get second week. It only gets tougher from there. The closer you get to the top, the more difficult it gets. I have a long ways to go. I do believe I can get there  and I'm going to do my best to get there  but it's not going to be easy.	4503_8.a	2012-08-29	M	4503	Benjamin Becker	Ryan Harrison	Since Agassi and Sampras, Americans have been looking for the one American that can take their spot at the top. People are saying you're the guy with potential. Do you pay attention to any of the stuff being said?	4503_8.q	61.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4503_9	Yeah, I've seen these guys all through juniors. Me and Bradley and Steve Johnson played each other all through juniors. Me and Jack actually never played until we were pros. I was playing with more of Klahn and Johnson and Rhyne Williams, the guy who played Andy. So I know all those guys pretty well. It's good to see them pushing each other and playing good tennis. I think once one of them has a good win, it becomes a realistic thing for everybody. You start playing more composed and more under control, not thinking that these guys are unbeatable. I certainly think for a guy like Bradley, you know, seeing Steve have the success he's had and so many of the matches he wins, he obviously gets out there and is playing good tennis. He has one game to serve this out, so it would be great to see another American go through. I think we've had four or five young Americans win a firstround match, which is great for U.S. tennis. To have this happening here, it gives us a good chance. I think one of the best things about this whole group of guys is how determined and motivated everyone is. You've heard obviously the lack of work ethic and all the chirps that you want to hear about that, but I think all these guys  I can speak especially for Bradley and Steve that they work really hard.	4503_9.a	2012-08-29	M	4503	Benjamin Becker	Ryan Harrison	Does it help you have others like Sock and Johnson who is suddenly having a good tournament here?	4503_9.q	61.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4503_10	It's going to start with my serve. If I serve well, everything kind of becomes a lot less, I guess, pressure on the rest of my game because I can dictate and I can actually swing out on some return games and have a little bit of a crack because there's not as much pressure. It's going to start with that. If things go my way, then I know I can return well enough to where I can put some pressure on him. I play good defense, so with some of his shotmaking, I can make him hit a couple extra balls on some of his service games. Like I said, it's not going to be easy, but I think I have the game to do it.	4503_10.a	2012-08-29	M	4503	Benjamin Becker	Ryan Harrison	Del Po has proven he can win this championship obviously. What are you going to have to do?	4503_10.q	61.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
680_0	Well, it doesn't have much to do with the next match really.  Totally different players, you know.  Conditions were very slow I thought tonight, you know.  And it was windy again, you know.  After a couple matches indoors, it was quite a change.  So I had to adjust to that.  It's going to be nothing like it in the next round.	680_0.a	2007-01-23	M	680	Tommy Robredo	Roger Federer	With a Roddick semifinal next, how did you assess tonight's match?	680_0.q	1.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
680_1	I think so, yeah.  From the one end it was really blowing against you, so it was really hard to get a grip from the baseline.  Plus, you know, he's a tough baseliner so he plays it smart.  I tried to change up a few things.  But didn't quite work.  I wasn't in the rhythm yet.  But I got that crucial actually first break which was against the wind. The wind sort of calmed down midway through the second set and also this is when we could then concentrate on playing the player, not against the wind.	680_1.a	2007-01-23	M	680	Tommy Robredo	Roger Federer	10 service breaks in the match, five in the first set.  Was that due to the wind?	680_1.q	1.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
680_2	Yeah, I mean, it's been a few years now.  I was very happy when he said yes, you know, to work with me.  It's been very interesting, you know.  Especially the first few months where we had to put everything on the table, you know, where he said what he thinks about my game, where he would like to go, that we kind of have the same mindset for the future.  That was quickly found, you know.  We've been working very hard in practice. I was fortunate enough that he always came over to Europe in the summer and I've had now the last three years with Tony in December, which is crucial.  We work very well together.  I don't see an end to it any time soon. But you know, look, he can decide whatever he wants to do really because he doesn't quite need it, you know, any more after all these years with tennis.  But I'm happy if he does, so...	680_2.a	2007-01-23	M	680	Tommy Robredo	Roger Federer	You've been with Tony Roche for a couple years.  Talk a little bit about what he brings to the table for you, and how long you expect that relationship to continue.	680_2.q	1.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
680_3	No, no, it's not all business.  But, I mean, we just have a good relationship.  It's really relaxed, you know.  I think usually tennis players are pretty laid back.  Their coach is usually, too. I think it's important, you know, to have a lot of respect for your coach because that sometimes can go away.  Especially when you make the breakthrough with somebody, you kind of know him before.  You're looking up to the coach before, and all of a sudden the coach is looking up to you.  Kind of changes a lot throughout the career. You know, when we got together, I was No.1 in the world.  I think there's always been a lot of respect for one and the other.  Yeah, it's been a good really relationship we've been in.  Don't see him all the time, you know, but we have decent contact, which was important.	680_3.a	2007-01-23	M	680	Tommy Robredo	Roger Federer	What is your relation like with him in general?  Is it really more like a friendship?  Is there a father figure involved?  Is it all business?	680_3.q	1.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
680_4	Yeah, I think I played pretty well.  The break of serves, they're due to the wind I assume tonight, the conditions, just being really cold, maybe not getting the same effect on the serve.  I had to kind of change my game around a little bit midway through the second set. I think my attacking style really worked out well.  I volleyed really well tonight.  You know, I had to battle much more from the baseline.  That was expected.  I'm really happy to have come through.	680_4.a	2007-01-23	M	680	Tommy Robredo	Roger Federer	Are you satisfied where your game is at at this stage of the tournament?	680_4.q	1.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
680_5	It depends how I play.  In Kooyong I came in a lot.  I doubt it will be that much.  It's important to knock off important volleys and be able to have that option.  I don't think it's going to come down to volleys, but we'll see what happens.	680_5.a	2007-01-23	M	680	Tommy Robredo	Roger Federer	Do you think your volley will be an important part of your game against Roddick?	680_5.q	1.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
680_6	Look, I don't know what his problem really was in terms his success because I always thought he was playing okay.  He just had a couple of shock losses for him really:  first round at the US Open and then the year before, he won a couple of rounds.  That was just very disappointing for him, you know.  That year when he lost to Johansson at the US Open, I thought he was almost like a favorite to win the tournament.  He was playing so well.  All of a sudden he lost in five sets. Yeah, I mean, I think he's really found his serve again.  His serve kind of got lost all of a sudden.  He didn't get the same free points any more.  He couldn't really, yeah, put the pressure on the opponent because it was too easy to return his serve.  I don't know if it's due to change of tactics or change of conditions.  All of a sudden, got really slower.  He's definitely picked that up again.  Ever since, he's been a great player again.	680_6.a	2007-01-23	M	680	Tommy Robredo	Roger Federer	When you played Andy at Kooyong, did he look like a different player to you than he's been since his improvements began?	680_6.q	1.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
680_7	No, no.  As long as I get through, I'm happy.  I think the five-setters and stuff also gives you a lot of information, which now maybe I don't get.  I prefer this scenario.  I'm really fresh coming into the semis.  I mean, that's key, you know.  They always say you can lose a tournament in the first week, but you can't win it.  That's exactly what I've been able to do in I don't know how many Slams now in a row I've been in the semis or in the finals.  I think that's also been a very important key to my success in the Grand Slams.	680_7.a	2007-01-23	M	680	Tommy Robredo	Roger Federer	Your efforts in getting the job done in three sets is outstanding.  Is that your own personal benchmark?  Do you have that in the back of your mind that you don't want to be dropping a set?	680_7.q	1.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
680_8	No.	680_8.a	2007-01-23	M	680	Tommy Robredo	Roger Federer	Do you set that down as a target to say, I want to do it in three all the way through?	680_8.q	1.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
680_9	It's going away.  Today was running more.  Look, I mean, I'm much, much better than, what, five or six days ago.  That's basically over.	680_9.a	2007-01-23	M	680	Tommy Robredo	Roger Federer	Do you have a cold here?	680_9.q	1.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
680_10	Like here?	680_10.a	2007-01-23	M	680	Tommy Robredo	Roger Federer	Given how good you are on grass, do you think the courts are ideal for you generally across the board or would you prefer more faster-court tournaments?	680_10.q	1.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
680_11	Well, I mean, the tour is kind of mainstream, that everybody's got a chance on any surface.  Before grass was really quick, you know, indoors was lightning, outdoors was medium sort of, clay was slow.  It's not that way any more, you know.  We have much more medium-paced outdoor.  Indoors has also been slowed down.  Grass has been really slowed down.  Everybody's got a chance now in a way.  So in a way it makes it more easy but more difficult at the same time. Hard to say.  I mean, I kind of like, you know, medium pace because it gives you the option to do a bit of everything.  But I don't know if it's entirely fair to all the players.  Look, that's just how it is.	680_11.a	2007-01-23	M	680	Tommy Robredo	Roger Federer	Than there are.	680_11.q	1.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
680_12	If it's an advantage for me or him?	680_12.a	2007-01-23	M	680	Tommy Robredo	Roger Federer	Is Roddick at much more of a disadvantage in a three-out-of-five-set match because eventually you figure him out towards the end?	680_12.q	1.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
680_13	Best of three is always a danger.  You can be a set and a break down in no time.  Against Andy especially that could be it.  But, look, that could be against other players, as well. That's the interesting part, especially in Grand Slams, you play more with the mind and the legs, you know, throughout the Slam.  Especially over a best-of-five set match, if that's an advantage for me, I hope it is, but I doubt it really.	680_13.a	2007-01-23	M	680	Tommy Robredo	Roger Federer	For you.  Versus two out of three at Shanghai.	680_13.q	1.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
680_14	I was playing better bit by bit.  I won my first Masters Series in Hamburg in 2002.  That was for me kind of a milestone.  I cracked the top 10, started to give myself more chances also in Grand Slam tournaments, started to make the third, fourth, quarterfinals on a regular basis.  All I really needed was a breakthrough kind of making the semis at a Slam.  I made that at Wimbledon first up.  I mean, I ended up winning the tournament and never looked back. I guess that loss at the French Open against Horna really put me down.  I was really disappointed.  The important was the reaction from then on.  Yeah, it was so important to come to Wimbledon with a good mindset again, and I was able to shake it off in a couple of weeks' time, which was important.	680_14.a	2007-01-23	M	680	Tommy Robredo	Roger Federer	In early '03 people were questioning when or if you would win a Slam.  After 2003 Wimbledon, the rest is tennis history.  What was the critical difference between you in '02 and '03?	680_14.q	1.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
680_15	It's tough.  I mean, I have to say, the media puts a lot of pressure on you as a youngster, as a player.  So I can imagine what the other youngsters are going through, the ones that haven't won slams yet.  Start to, you know, question you.  Shouldn't you be making that breakthrough soon and everything?  You start doubting yourself as well.  It's hard and tough. But, look, that's just the way it is.  When you're young, everybody's interested especially in the tennis game the interest is so much on the youngsters.  Yeah, I'm happy I'm not there any more.	680_15.a	2007-01-23	M	680	Tommy Robredo	Roger Federer	Did you ever get impatient or concerned about your progress in Grand Slams?	680_15.q	1.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
680_16	Yes, I saw from the second set on till the end.  Yeah, I thought it was a very interesting match.  I think Andy did well.  I don't know what happened with his rib or whatever.  Looked like he was totally in control and all of a sudden he just gave it away, then came back. It was a very awkward match.  It was very interesting, I thought.  I mean, Raf is incredibly tough.  I like to watch him just battle it out.  I love seeing that.  I mean, he was so strong in the end.  He deserved to win.  But Murray was really close.  It was great to see a five-setter.	680_16.a	2007-01-23	M	680	Tommy Robredo	Roger Federer	Did you watch any of the Murray/Nadal match last night?  If so, what were your impressions?	680_16.q	1.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
680_17	No, I wasn't.	680_17.a	2007-01-23	M	680	Tommy Robredo	Roger Federer	Were you surprised how hard Andy pushed him?	680_17.q	1.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
680_18	"Well, I mean, ""rival"", absolutely.  I think we've played on so many big occasions against each other, look, I mean, if I wouldn't have been there, maybe look at the success he would have had, in Wimbledon especially, maybe at the US Open as well. Uhm, yeah, I mean, we've had some really close matches.  We're about the same age.  You know, he's been No.1.  I mean, I don't think the record really plays much a role.  Now that we've played over 10 times, I think it gets always very interesting.  I think the record is good for me, but I think it's still a great match with Andy."	680_18.a	2007-01-23	M	680	Tommy Robredo	Roger Federer	When you're 12-1 against a guy, like you are with Roddick, is he a real rival to you?  Do you consider him to be a real rival?	680_18.q	1.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
680_19	No, I've always been very happy.  I switched from 85 to 90 back in 2002 just before I won Hamburg really.  That was for me a big move because I was really shanking a lot of balls.	680_19.a	2007-01-23	M	680	Tommy Robredo	Roger Federer	You're the one out there that plays with the smallest racquet on court.  Did you try a bigger size?  You're playing with a 90.  Did you try a 95 and you didn't like?	680_19.q	1.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
680_20	With the 85.  Then I changed to a 90.  I asked Wilson to make something special for me.  Yeah, I mean, it's a great racquet for me.  Funny, I wanted to play with the racquet of Sampras, now Sampras is playing with the racquet of me.  Kind of weird (smiling).  Look, he changed to mine now as well. I mean, really helped me a lot.  I never really tried a bigger head size racquets.  I don't think it would maybe help me much.	680_20.a	2007-01-23	M	680	Tommy Robredo	Roger Federer	With the 95?	680_20.q	1.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
680_21	Still the smallest, yes.  But the best one (smiling).	680_21.a	2007-01-23	M	680	Tommy Robredo	Roger Federer	It's still the smallest on tour.	680_21.q	1.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
680_22	For me, that worked.  I've seen other players playing the way I do, but mostly play the different way.  I've done that also in 2002 already.  I was actually one of the first to make that switch, breaking so many strings.  It's given me much more control.  I'm happy that it's been working. I think the strings have really also changed the game a little bit because everybody tried to slow down the conditions, so the players had to react in terms of getting control back.  It was not so much the power that made it - how do you say - the effect of winning or losing was more actually not missing.  That's what we have today, that kind of problem, no one is going for enough any more.	680_22.a	2007-01-23	M	680	Tommy Robredo	Roger Federer	The string combination, you have a special string combination, filament and gut.  Usually players have the strings the other way around.	680_22.q	1.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4948_0	Yeah, I think it was really a great match from both of us. It was very tight and every game was very close. I'm just happy that I'm through. And how you said, I played a lot of threesetters this season. When I lost the first set, I still was thinking that I still go to third, so I was still positive.	4948_0.a	2013-10-04	F	4948	Na Li	Petra Kvitova	You had a really hardfought match tonight. You've played a lot of threeset matches this season. What made the difference for you tonight?	4948_0.q	7.0	1	Quarterfinals	CHINA OPEN	Premier
4948_1	Yeah, I think so. I mean, the important points was very tough and it was a lot. And, I mean, I lost them in the first set and I won them in the second; the third was pretty close. I was 31 down and think I just, Okay, I need to play my game again and go for it. I tried to play aggressive the key points, too, so probably she was right.	4948_1.a	2013-10-04	F	4948	Na Li	Petra Kvitova	Congratulations. You are in semifinal of China Open. Li Na just said that you did better on the key points than she did, so that's key of this whole match. Do you agree with that?	4948_1.q	7.0	1	Quarterfinals	CHINA OPEN	Premier
4948_2	If it's big secret I'm not going to tell you, but I don't think that it's secret. I start fitness preparation with my new fitness coach and I feel really good physically on the court. That shows good tennis from me, too, what we are working with David, too. So it's all of these are connecting. The first round in Tokyo was pretty nervous from my side, and then I played better a better every match I played. I feel similar this week here in Beijing. So that's what I want to tell about.	4948_2.a	2013-10-04	F	4948	Na Li	Petra Kvitova	You haven't had this kind of success playing in the Asian season before in your career. What do you think is the secret for this year? You win Tokyo and semifinal here in Beijing. These are very good results.	4948_2.q	7.0	1	Quarterfinals	CHINA OPEN	Premier
4948_3	The first question, yeah, that's true, we are good friends. Almost every week we are practicing before the tournaments, so we know each other very well. But you can't compare practice and match. That's totally different. She knows me as well as I know her. I don't think that it was really advantage for someone. And I will not tell you what we talk about on the net. I just wish her good luck and that we going to see each other in Istanbul.	4948_3.a	2013-10-04	F	4948	Na Li	Petra Kvitova	I was told you and Li Na are very good friends. You train all the time. Can I say that you benefit from the training before and that makes you know her tactics more than other players? One more. What did you say after the game when you were at the net?	4948_3.q	7.0	1	Quarterfinals	CHINA OPEN	Premier
4948_4	Yeah. If I stay in this condition, maybe, but it's still semifinal tomorrow. I play Jankovic and that's not easy. I played her two times already and it's not easy. Big fight. I know what I'm expecting. She's trying to qualify Istanbul and she has a big motivation. So I think it's going to be really tough match tomorrow, and I need to be 100% ready for tomorrow.	4948_4.a	2013-10-04	F	4948	Na Li	Petra Kvitova	Do you think staying and playing at this level like tonight you're going to be a serious contender in China Open and also the Championships?	4948_4.q	7.0	1	Quarterfinals	CHINA OPEN	Premier
4948_5	I don't think so. I mean, 2011 was really incredible season for me and I was really ready for everything. I was ready physically, mentally, and technically, too. Now I'm feeling better than I have felt before, but I played a lot of threesetters since the beginning of the season, too. I don't think that I really felt better physically. Now I feel a little bit better, but still I'm playing threesetters. That's all right. Against Li Na, that's normal. It's no big surprise.	4948_5.a	2013-10-04	F	4948	Na Li	Petra Kvitova	As you said, you played a lot of threesetters this season and you won most of them. Do you think you are physically a better player than when you won Wimbledon?	4948_5.q	7.0	1	Quarterfinals	CHINA OPEN	Premier
4948_6	Yeah, I mean, I was surprised from the beginning when I came here that I have a lot of the fans in China. It's really nice to have them for sure. I'm really glad. It's big thank to them. I was expecting that they will support Li Na today. That's normal. Wasn't a big surprise. But I heard some fans on my side, too, so it was so nice.	4948_6.a	2013-10-04	F	4948	Na Li	Petra Kvitova	All the spectators were cheering for Li Na. Did you hear a group of them were cheering for you all the time? Did you expect that you have so many fans here in China?	4948_6.q	7.0	1	Quarterfinals	CHINA OPEN	Premier
2533_0	The last set, I think he was serving unbelievable that two points. I couldn't do nothing. I put the racquet like this, and the ball fly out.	2533_0.a	2010-01-25	M	2533	nan	Nicolas Almagro	Well done. You survived a couple of breaks in the third and fourth. What happened in the last? How hard was the last set?	2533_0.q	25.0	0	4th Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
2533_1	Maybe. He's in the tournament. Me not. I go home. This is the most important. He's playing well. I think he has many chance to be on the semifinal or in the final.	2533_1.a	2010-01-25	M	2533	nan	Nicolas Almagro	Do you think he has the game to be able to go on and maybe take the title this year?	2533_1.q	25.0	0	4th Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
2533_2	I feel now a little bit sad. No, but I'm happy. I was playing very good in the third and the fourth set. In the fifth I have -- I was very unlucky with that ball. But now I want to think in my person, and my person said I need to go South America to play in clay courts and to be in top 10. But I need to work more now.	2533_2.a	2010-01-25	M	2533	nan	Nicolas Almagro	What about for you? The game was so long. How are you feeling now and is there a bit more belief for you?	2533_2.q	25.0	0	4th Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
114_0	Yeah, it's very big, especially I did not play a lot of matches since the beginning of the season. You know, I'm coming back from an injury. You know, my back injury. Then I tore a muscle in Doha. So I was able to recover very fast and did not really get a lot of practice in before this tournament. So overall, you know, it's very big. Especially Madison is such a tough player, is in form, and has done very well in Australia. She is an up and coming player that is so tough to play against. So very, very happy and pleased that I was able to stay strong and fight, you know, through this match and win.	114_0.a	2015-03-16	F	114	Madison Keys	Jelena Jankovic	How big is this win for you at this point of the season?	114_0.q	21.0	1	3rd Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
114_1	I mean, it was like bombs or bullets constantly coming at me for about twoandahalf hours. I mean, her ball is so strong. It's such a heavy ball. I think she's probably, I mean, maybe with Serena. Probably the hardest hitting player out there in this moment. I mean, she hits the ball at such a high pace. It's unbelievable. It was not easy. I was trying to stay low. I was trying to, you know, get those balls back as much as I could. She did not give me a lot of rhythm. I had a hard time playing my game. I did not have a lot of time to set up or hit my shots at all, so I tried to serve well and hit, you know, a couple of shots and execute as much as I could. My focus had to be really high, and I could not let down, especially the points are going so fast. So overall, it was mentally tough, and physically, as well. I'm really happy I got through this one.	114_1.a	2015-03-16	F	114	Madison Keys	Jelena Jankovic	Can you talk about the pace coming off of the racquet for Madison? What is it like...	114_1.q	21.0	1	3rd Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
114_2	It was so cool. It brings those great memories back. You know, I have had some really, really good times, you know, with my mom. She used to travel with me. She was with me on tour for many, many years. When I won in 2010 she was in the stands, so every time I looked up, I was kind of you know, I kind of had that memory in there. You know, her support means a lot to me. It's nice to have her here.	114_2.a	2015-03-16	F	114	Madison Keys	Jelena Jankovic	How was it to have your mom back courtside?	114_2.q	21.0	1	3rd Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
114_3	She's not going to travel, you know. Because we have a house in SanDiego, so she was up there. My brother came, as well. I have two brothers and my mom with me. So it's nice that they are all here. I mean, I'm very close to my family, and I really appreciate their support.	114_3.a	2015-03-16	F	114	Madison Keys	Jelena Jankovic	Did she miss it, the time away?	114_3.q	21.0	1	3rd Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
114_4	She plays a completely different game. She places the ball and hits a lot of down the lines and kind of takes the ball early. But it's completely different. She makes a lot more balls than Madison. Madison goes for a lot and she executes. She goes for a really huge shots, winners, or she can make mistakes. It's going to be a different match, a different style of play. So hopefully I can recover well and be ready for tomorrow. It's going to be a tough one, as well.	114_4.a	2015-03-16	F	114	Madison Keys	Jelena Jankovic	Kind of a change of pace the next round against Bencic. Can you talk about that, playing her, the change of pace and your thoughts?	114_4.q	21.0	1	3rd Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
114_5	You know, I had my chances. I think I was up 53 in the first set and I think I got tired physically. It was so humid and so hot out there, and somehow I let down, you know. Physically I couldn't keep up. So hopefully, you know, this match will be every match is different match and conditions are different. We will see. Hopefully I can do it.	114_5.a	2015-03-16	F	114	Madison Keys	Jelena Jankovic	What were your memories of that match you guys had last year at the US Open?	114_5.q	21.0	1	3rd Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
114_6	I think I'm staying really positive and I'm just happy to be back on the court. I think that's what matters. I suffered, you know, with my back injury. Then, you know, I tore that muscle against Kvitova. That was disappointing, as well. You know, but with good, positive attitude, I'm hanging there and trying to stay tough and get through, you know, these kind of time periods. You know, once I get back on the court, which I did, I appreciate it a lot more. So I'm enjoying my tennis, having a fun out there, fighting hard, and I cannot ask for more. And I love this place. I love playing in Indian Wells. It's probably, if not my favorite tournament to play, you know, with Rome and a couple of other places. So I really love it here. I'm a California girl now. (Laughter). And I should, right?	114_6.a	2015-03-16	F	114	Madison Keys	Jelena Jankovic	In Brisbane you sounded pretty pessimistic about your back and everything. How are you feeling now? Are you feeling back to good?	114_6.q	21.0	1	3rd Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
114_7	Yeah, but you would take your time too when those balls are coming at you. What else am I supposed to do?	114_7.a	2015-03-16	F	114	Madison Keys	Jelena Jankovic	In the second set it started to look like a lot of psychology out there. It was very interesting to watch. You slowed down the pace of play a lot. You'd walk over to get the towel and walk back. It was interesting to see what you were doing. That kind of played a big factor, especially in the second and third set. She was pumped up and ready to go.	114_7.q	21.0	1	3rd Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
114_8	That was dumb from my side. And I agree. I used my challenges early on in that first set and then I had none. I agree I can be really bad with my challenges sometimes. You know, soon I will need, you know, my glasses. But it's okay, you know. It's part of the game.	114_8.a	2015-03-16	F	114	Madison Keys	Jelena Jankovic	But also you did something I have never seen before. You challenged the second point of the match.	114_8.q	21.0	1	3rd Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
114_9	I probably do. And I agree with you guys. I agree with the stats. I'm not, you know I'm not very accurate. And sometimes I do it, you know, for the sake of it, and sometimes I just really want the ball to be in. Doesn't matter if it's so out, I'm still like, Please, please, somehow... But it's not happening. (Laughter).	114_9.a	2015-03-16	F	114	Madison Keys	Jelena Jankovic	Do you know that you have one of the lowest challenging success rates?	114_9.q	21.0	1	3rd Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
114_10	What do you mean? I have a house right there. Maybe I should get the Californian accent.	114_10.a	2015-03-16	F	114	Madison Keys	Jelena Jankovic	What makes you a California girl? What's the most California thing about Jelena Jankovic?	114_10.q	21.0	1	3rd Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
114_11	How is it?	114_11.a	2015-03-16	F	114	Madison Keys	Jelena Jankovic	Can you do one?	114_11.q	21.0	1	3rd Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
114_12	Dude. Like. I was, like, you know. (Laughter.) Okay. I mean, I don't surf. I mean, not yet. With those injuries I had, I mean, let me get my body place, you know, kind of complete so that I can do all these things. I mean, I have a Californian tan. I'm tan. I don't know. What do you want from me?	114_12.a	2015-03-16	F	114	Madison Keys	Jelena Jankovic	Say dude a lot.	114_12.q	21.0	1	3rd Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
114_13	No.	114_13.a	2015-03-16	F	114	Madison Keys	Jelena Jankovic	Do you complain about traffic a lot?	114_13.q	21.0	1	3rd Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
114_14	I'm fine.	114_14.a	2015-03-16	F	114	Madison Keys	Jelena Jankovic	It's a big thing.	114_14.q	21.0	1	3rd Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
114_15	Yeah.	114_15.a	2015-03-16	F	114	Madison Keys	Jelena Jankovic	You can try doing that.	114_15.q	21.0	1	3rd Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
114_16	I mean, it's not fair to compare players. I mean, they are hardhitting players, but, you know, I can just comment on Madison today. I mean, she's a tough player to play against. Does not give you rhythm. She hits such a hard ball, you know. One of the, you know, probably top three hardhitting players out there with Serena. Probably, I mean, if not the hardest, the second. I don't have the radar or something. I have played all these players, and it's not easy, especially when she gets the ball deep. It's so tough. It's constantly coming like that. Her serve, her groundstrokes. So you have to really stay up there, you know, hang in there at the baseline and try to not get pushed, you know, with those balls and hold your ground and do it the best you can. I mean, if she can execute and make all these balls in, then well done. There is nothing you can do. You know, she's going to make mistakes and she's going to have ups and downs. So you wait for your chances. That's what I did.	114_16.a	2015-03-16	F	114	Madison Keys	Jelena Jankovic	Moving away from the California stereotypes. Going back to Madison, you mentioned her power, comparing it to Serena's power. How does it rate with Petra's power? How does that ball feel when you hit it?	114_16.q	21.0	1	3rd Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
1606_0	A lot of time like this (back and forth). Was very tough match. Very tough mentally.	1606_0.a	2008-06-13	M	1606	Ivo Karlovic	Rafael Nadal	There was a lot of back and forth during the match to see which side his serve was going to go?	1606_0.q	2.0	1	Quarterfinals	THE ARTOIS CHAMPIONSHIPS	International
1606_1	Yeah, very important win, no? At the same time tough win because tonight I have the Friday night in Mallorca (smiling). No, seriously, is a very important win because I beat against one specialist on this surface, big server. I practice my return. I think I return well. But I didn't have lot of chances. When I touch the ball, I return well. I think was very tough mentally match, but at the same time I was very focused all the time, no? I have two Love-30 with my serve, but never I had a breakpoint against, and I have two breakpoints for me. And, you know, on grass, especially these matches, anything is deciding in two balls. So is very important to be prepared, have the best concentration. And today after 7-6 against the first set, I think I was very concentrate all the time. I'm playing important points very well in the tiebreaks, the next two tiebreaks.	1606_1.a	2008-06-13	M	1606	Ivo Karlovic	Rafael Nadal	Your reaction afterwards showed how important it was to win. A good win for you?	1606_1.q	2.0	1	Quarterfinals	THE ARTOIS CHAMPIONSHIPS	International
1606_2	Well, when the match was coming, especially in the third set, in the third set I start to feeling the ball very well with the forehand, no? I have a lot of winners, difficult winners, some very good passing shots, too. I finished the match feeling the ball perfect with the forehand.	1606_2.a	2008-06-13	M	1606	Ivo Karlovic	Rafael Nadal	In the last tiebreak, you looked very comfortable dealing with his slice. Seemed to be like a coaching session for you where you were executing the forehand.	1606_2.q	2.0	1	Quarterfinals	THE ARTOIS CHAMPIONSHIPS	International
1606_3	Is one of my best balls, one of my best shots, no? When the other guy is doing the slice against my forehand, I have a very good shot there - normally, not always (smiling).	1606_3.a	2008-06-13	M	1606	Ivo Karlovic	Rafael Nadal	You were never troubled with the low ball?	1606_3.q	2.0	1	Quarterfinals	THE ARTOIS CHAMPIONSHIPS	International
1606_4	Nothing. Is like a penalty. You have 50% for one place to other place. And after, with this 50%, you have 50%, because if you go to the good place, after you have to try to touch the ball good. And is very difficult, too, no?	1606_4.a	2008-06-13	M	1606	Ivo Karlovic	Rafael Nadal	Can you describe what it is like receiving a serve from Karlovic?	1606_4.q	2.0	1	Quarterfinals	THE ARTOIS CHAMPIONSHIPS	International
1606_5	Yeah. Is impossible wait in the middle, no? Is no chance.	1606_5.a	2008-06-13	M	1606	Ivo Karlovic	Rafael Nadal	Do you have to guess where he is going to hit it?	1606_5.q	2.0	1	Quarterfinals	THE ARTOIS CHAMPIONSHIPS	International
1606_6	I need, no? I was joking in the beginning with the Friday night. But the true, I need three days off, no? Four gonna be amazing (smiling). Yeah, is impossible to play -- well, after this tournament I gonna have. If I lose yesterday, I gonna arrive to Wimbledon on Tuesday. But, you know, I am in semifinals right now. I don't gonna come back before Wednesday if I lose tomorrow. If I play the final, probably Thursday.	1606_6.a	2008-06-13	M	1606	Ivo Karlovic	Rafael Nadal	To be serious, you joked about Friday night in Mallorca. Even for someone like you, who is such a competitor, how difficult is it after a long clay court campaign, you've come to have some good grass court preparation, wouldn't it be nice to have three days' rest?	1606_6.q	2.0	1	Quarterfinals	THE ARTOIS CHAMPIONSHIPS	International
1606_7	Go back.	1606_7.a	2008-06-13	M	1606	Ivo Karlovic	Rafael Nadal	So whatever happens, you are definitely going to go home for a few days?	1606_7.q	2.0	1	Quarterfinals	THE ARTOIS CHAMPIONSHIPS	International
1606_8	I go back. Impossible to be here for more time. I spend like nine days in the last four months at home. I need play golf.	1606_8.a	2008-06-13	M	1606	Ivo Karlovic	Rafael Nadal	You've got to go back?	1606_8.q	2.0	1	Quarterfinals	THE ARTOIS CHAMPIONSHIPS	International
1606_9	No, I only play golf with my friends, my family, and it feel like I am not playing tournament, no? And if I am here, anyway, if I go to play golf, I am thinking I am here for play tournament, no? So I need be there. I need be with the friends, be with the family, and forget the tennis for a few days, no? But I have important match tomorrow in semifinals. For me is going to be important match. Going to be good test. Well, the true, if I win tomorrow and play the final here, is a very good points for me.	1606_9.a	2008-06-13	M	1606	Ivo Karlovic	Rafael Nadal	We do have golf courses here.	1606_9.q	2.0	1	Quarterfinals	THE ARTOIS CHAMPIONSHIPS	International
1606_10	I don't know, no? I just go on court, try my best every game, every point, try to be very focused with myself. That's what I thought before the match. If he has a break, you're finish, no? I said yesterday, wait. When you are returning, wait your chance, because you're never gonna break him, but he can break himself sometimes, no? He can have one double-fault, one volley miss. And if that's happen, and you have one good return in that game, you can do the break. So wait your opportunity, no? You don't gonna have four good returns and you're gonna break him. That's impossible. But sometimes can happen something like this, no? But today I think Karlovic improves a lot in the last time, last months, last years. He is volleying very well. He has very good movements on the volley. And he didn't have a bad forehand, no? And the slice is tough here playing on grass.	1606_10.a	2008-06-13	M	1606	Ivo Karlovic	Rafael Nadal	Did you mentally prepare before the match today it was going to go to tiebreaks, playing a big server?	1606_10.q	2.0	1	Quarterfinals	THE ARTOIS CHAMPIONSHIPS	International
1606_11	No, no, no, I know if I am playing well, I can play well in every surface, and especially here on grass. I played two finals in Wimbledon last two years. First one maybe you can do by chance. But when you have the second one, beating against very tough players on grass, like Soderling, like Fish, like Berdych, Youzhny, Djokovic -- Djokovic retired, but having good chances for win the title against Federer in the final, you believe you can play very good in this surface, no? So I know I can go to Wimbledon and lose in first round because this surface you don't have hundred percent control of the nothing. But at the same time if I am playing well and the draw is a little respect with me, I gonna have chances for have a good tournament, too, no?	1606_11.a	2008-06-13	M	1606	Ivo Karlovic	Rafael Nadal	Does a win like that today show yourself how much you have improved as a grass court player in two, three years?	1606_11.q	2.0	1	Quarterfinals	THE ARTOIS CHAMPIONSHIPS	International
1606_12	Well, you know, no, is a big change play to grass and in one day. So I feel little bit pain in the right knee. But, you know, I start the match feeling the pain, and when the match was coming, I feel much better. Is normal. Normal have little bit pain in the beginning. But hopefully for the next week I have some few days rest. I need this rest. And after I prepare little bit more and arrive physically hundred percent to Wimbledon.	1606_12.a	2008-06-13	M	1606	Ivo Karlovic	Rafael Nadal	Yesterday you complained a bit about your health. How do you feel physically today? How about your knees?	1606_12.q	2.0	1	Quarterfinals	THE ARTOIS CHAMPIONSHIPS	International
877_0	I think in the second set I came back and I won the second set, and I did 3-Love.  And maybe at that time I stepped a little bit back.  I was not hitting as aggressive and hitting the ball in the court.  And she really started playing much better.  She was hitting early.  And I just even at 5-3, I told myself in my head I wanted to be more aggressive, and I just keep playing the way that I was playing in the second set.  So I'm happy that I came back, and I really believe that I could win, and I'm happy that I did.	877_0.a	2007-08-14	F	877	Ai Sugiyama	Stephanie Dubois	So what was your mindset after losing the lead at 3-0, and then falling behind 5-3?  What did you call on to make the comeback at the end?  What did you change?	877_0.q	115.0	1	1st Round	ROGERS CUP PRESENTED BY AMERICAN EXPRESS	1
877_1	No, I don't remember all of her mistakes.  Maybe I think she did some mistakes I'm not sure on her forehand or her backhand, but I think everybody does.  But I think I just keep -- I just keep playing my game, and I think it worked out at the end. Even in the third set was a little bit shaky for me, but I really came back.  And I just believe in my shots and what I can do, and I'm happy that I came back.	877_1.a	2007-08-14	F	877	Ai Sugiyama	Stephanie Dubois	It seemed like she was making a ton of unforced errors on the backhand side, were you focusing primarily to try to push it on that side?	877_1.q	115.0	1	1st Round	ROGERS CUP PRESENTED BY AMERICAN EXPRESS	1
877_2	Yeah, the crowd was amazing.  I love to play in Canada, Montreal, Toronto and here.  It's an amazing people - sorry.  The support really helped me going through that match.  And this means a lot to me because that's my favorite tournament.  It's in Canada.  And since I'm little, I'm watching it and I wanted to play in it, so I'm really happy that I keep going.  And I'll keep focusing on my next match, even if it's a tough one.	877_2.a	2007-08-14	F	877	Ai Sugiyama	Stephanie Dubois	What does it mean to get this result in Canada in front of a crowd that was supporting you so much?	877_2.q	115.0	1	1st Round	ROGERS CUP PRESENTED BY AMERICAN EXPRESS	1
877_3	Yeah, for sure.  I did good last year.  I think I won against -- I played good, and Frank also did well last week in Montreal.  For me to come here and believing in me and win, it means a lot to me, and yeah.	877_3.a	2007-08-14	F	877	Ai Sugiyama	Stephanie Dubois	You had the success last year in Montreal, is that something you can build on even though it's a different venue?	877_3.q	115.0	1	1st Round	ROGERS CUP PRESENTED BY AMERICAN EXPRESS	1
877_4	Yes, I have all my family here except for my brother.  Yeah, and my coach are all here.  They've been so helpful and supporting me, so I thank them.  And I think it's -- it was a great match today, and I'm happy.	877_4.a	2007-08-14	F	877	Ai Sugiyama	Stephanie Dubois	Do you have any friends here or family here watching you today?	877_4.q	115.0	1	1st Round	ROGERS CUP PRESENTED BY AMERICAN EXPRESS	1
877_5	Yeah, for sure, I know where they stand and where they sit.  So, yeah, for sure, I hear them, and it makes me feel better for sure on the court.	877_5.a	2007-08-14	F	877	Ai Sugiyama	Stephanie Dubois	Could you pick out their voices in the crowd when they were cheering or were you aware of them there?	877_5.q	115.0	1	1st Round	ROGERS CUP PRESENTED BY AMERICAN EXPRESS	1
877_6	Well, like with my -- I was going to Montreal and because I'm from Montreal, but I was going to the site and just asking for autographs and signatures.  And I remember Michael Chang, Sanchez even Steffi Graff.  So for me it's nice, it's a tournament that means a lot to me.  I'm really happy that I'm playing in it and I'm winning.  For sure, it's nice.	877_6.a	2007-08-14	F	877	Ai Sugiyama	Stephanie Dubois	You said when you were little you watched this tournament a fair bit.  What are some of your memories of it when you were a young kid, and who did you watch then that you really liked?	877_6.q	115.0	1	1st Round	ROGERS CUP PRESENTED BY AMERICAN EXPRESS	1
877_7	It's one of the biggest, yeah.  She was an amazing player.  She was in the top 10 for I don't know how many years, and now maybe she's dropped a little bit.  But she's been around for a long time and she's really experienced.  Yeah, for sure, it's a great win.  I cannot say -- I don't know the rankings, but I think with the name, it's the biggest win for me.	877_7.a	2007-08-14	F	877	Ai Sugiyama	Stephanie Dubois	Is this the biggest win of your career, do you think?	877_7.q	115.0	1	1st Round	ROGERS CUP PRESENTED BY AMERICAN EXPRESS	1
877_8	Yeah, yeah, so yeah, it's nice.	877_8.a	2007-08-14	F	877	Ai Sugiyama	Stephanie Dubois	She's 27 in the world, so, pretty good?	877_8.q	115.0	1	1st Round	ROGERS CUP PRESENTED BY AMERICAN EXPRESS	1
877_9	Maybe, maybe it's just me.  I'm a little bit I have a personality.  Sometimes you know they make good calls, sometimes bad calls.  But you have the chance to maybe have the point, so, it's just I think it's just fun when you win, it's just funny.	877_9.a	2007-08-14	F	877	Ai Sugiyama	Stephanie Dubois	I noticed you were challenging calls, and when you won them you were pumping your fist as if you just won a shot.  Is that you were just really pumped up in the match?	877_9.q	115.0	1	1st Round	ROGERS CUP PRESENTED BY AMERICAN EXPRESS	1
877_10	Yeah, I think -- oh, yeah, one mistake, I think.  But yeah, it's great when you win the point.	877_10.a	2007-08-14	F	877	Ai Sugiyama	Stephanie Dubois	You got more right today than you got wrong?	877_10.q	115.0	1	1st Round	ROGERS CUP PRESENTED BY AMERICAN EXPRESS	1
877_11	Yes, I've been playing really good these past few weeks.  Didn't have a great start of the year, and I think I've worked really hard on my mental and my physical on the court and keep playing every point.  Really, it was really important for me to be really tough. And my coach, Simon, helped me a lot through this, and all the people around me really helped me to believe more in myself and that's what I did.  They were really supporting with me.  And I thank them, because it helps me a lot.  So I've been working a lot on that side.	877_11.a	2007-08-14	F	877	Ai Sugiyama	Stephanie Dubois	Sort of a slow start for you this season.  I'm just wondering are you feeling a little bit more confident as the season is progressing and your game now?	877_11.q	115.0	1	1st Round	ROGERS CUP PRESENTED BY AMERICAN EXPRESS	1
877_12	Yeah, for sure, I think every point is important.  You have to control yourself.  Sometimes I do, and I think that's what I want to do.  And I just have a little bit of a -- I think I'm really feisty on the court, and it's one of my - not weapon, but it's -- I think if I was not that like this in that match, maybe it would have went the other way, because I really believe in myself and I wanted every point, so I think it's a good thing.	877_12.a	2007-08-14	F	877	Ai Sugiyama	Stephanie Dubois	Was the mental part a little harder to kind of overcome?  Because I noticed you're really hard on yourself if you lose a point.  You kind of shriek or smack yourself or scrape the racquet against the ground.  Is that something your coach wanted you to try to put the point behind and you just kind of focus ahead?	877_12.q	115.0	1	1st Round	ROGERS CUP PRESENTED BY AMERICAN EXPRESS	1
877_13	After here I'll do my stretching and stuff.  But I will -- I will just look in the -- focusing on myself after the match and do my stretching.  And for sure, I will play it like if it was another match.  Even if she's in the top 10 and she's a good player, I will just keep doing my thing that I'm doing with my routine and my coaches.  And I think everything's going to be good.	877_13.a	2007-08-14	F	877	Ai Sugiyama	Stephanie Dubois	What will you be doing to prepare for your mechanics next match?	877_13.q	115.0	1	1st Round	ROGERS CUP PRESENTED BY AMERICAN EXPRESS	1
877_14	For sure it means a lot to me.  I think I gave everything that I had today.  She's a great player, and I had the chance to play against a girl like that, and I just believe in me and my shots. And for sure, playing against another top 10 player, it's really great, and I'm really looking forward to play against her.  For sure it's an opportunity for me.  It's here in Canada, Toronto, and I love to play here, so it's going to be great.  It's going to be a battle tomorrow.	877_14.a	2007-08-14	F	877	Ai Sugiyama	Stephanie Dubois	Well done today.  Can you talk a little about the belief and self confidence that you take out as a result against such an experienced player?  Because I think you're playing Petrova in the next round, so that's another step-up itself.  What does a result like that do to your own self belief as a young and aspiring professional?	877_14.q	115.0	1	1st Round	ROGERS CUP PRESENTED BY AMERICAN EXPRESS	1
877_15	You usually only we say good match to each other.  And she was really nice after the match.	877_15.a	2007-08-14	F	877	Ai Sugiyama	Stephanie Dubois	Did your opponent today say anything after the match to you like congratulations or anything?	877_15.q	115.0	1	1st Round	ROGERS CUP PRESENTED BY AMERICAN EXPRESS	1
6447_0	Well, yeah, I mean, she just kind of got the return back. Goes to show if you get it in play, anything can happen. Unfortunately it clipped the net. But stayed focused in the third set because you got to play it. So that's all I did.	6447_0.a	2014-06-23	F	6447	nan	Venus Williams	You lost the second set on sort of a fluke let cord thing. I know you're trying to save energy and not play three sets. How do you come back from that kind of frustration?	6447_0.q	30.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6447_1	Yeah, it was great. I mean, I think my opponent played amazing. She just was playing so well, going for everything. So it was definitely a challenge today against someone who is just playing such inspired tennis. It's definitely a nice start.	6447_1.a	2014-06-23	F	6447	nan	Venus Williams	How did it feel to get back to winning ways at Wimbledon?	6447_1.q	30.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6447_2	Of course, obviously it feels good to win. I mean, it feels good to, you know, play well against an opponent who is playing well and advance to the next round. That always helps. First match on a new surface.	6447_2.a	2014-06-23	F	6447	nan	Venus Williams	Does it give you confidence to have gotten through quite a tough first set, especially on grass, a surface that you love?	6447_2.q	30.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6447_3	Yeah, I mean, you just get diagnosed when you have symptoms, so that's pretty much it.	6447_3.a	2014-06-23	F	6447	nan	Venus Williams	You looked like your strength is fine, like you've gotten it back. You did an interview with a magazine about the syndrome you had, how difficult it was, how tired you'd get. How do you fight back from that and how was it even diagnosed? I researched it and it's a strange kind of thing.	6447_3.q	30.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6447_4	Yeah, it took a long time. Unfortunately it's not something you had; it's something you have. So on a daily basis I'm trying to get the best out of myself. That's all I can ask, is to get the best out of me. I never compare myself to anybody else.	6447_4.a	2014-06-23	F	6447	nan	Venus Williams	Did it take them a long time for them to figure it out?	6447_4.q	30.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6447_5	I'm doing the absolute best I can. So, yeah, every day.	6447_5.a	2014-06-23	F	6447	nan	Venus Williams	You're treating it in such a way you feel like your strength is back?	6447_5.q	30.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6447_6	It's just absolute focus in this tournament and in all tournaments. Obviously I've done well on this surface. The surface is quite different than before. Now it's more about rallies. The courts are very slow. The ball stays up. So it's very different. I definitely come in with a different mentality than before.	6447_6.a	2014-06-23	F	6447	nan	Venus Williams	Is it still the same coming back every year? Is it different now?	6447_6.q	30.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6447_7	Yeah, I watched all of Serena's matches. That's pretty much what I did. Last year was a crazy year for the men and women, so... It's a whole other year. Most people are determined. For me it was best not to come because I couldn't really serve. You can't really play tennis if you can't really serve. It was in my best interest not to come here. It was pretty clear that I needed to stay home.	6447_7.a	2014-06-23	F	6447	nan	Venus Williams	If you can think back to a year ago, what was it like for you not to be at Wimbledon? How much did you pay attention at all to the tournament?	6447_7.q	30.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6447_8	Well, I tried to spend my time on other things, you know, be productive in other ways if I can't be on the court or at the tournament. If anything, it was a relief because I just played the French Open. It was just terrible having to play like that. Just didn't want to be in that situation again.	6447_8.a	2014-06-23	F	6447	nan	Venus Williams	What was that feeling like? Every year in June you come here. It was the first time you weren't able to come and play.	6447_8.q	30.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6447_9	I don't know. I'm not as up on ladies tennis as some of you are in here. I didn't know they were working together. I'm sorry. I know they are now. It's great. A coach is a coach; it doesn't matter what gender it is. That's my opinion.	6447_9.a	2014-06-23	F	6447	nan	Venus Williams	You've spoken in terms of your work as being in the tradition of Billie Jean in terms of equal opportunity, equal pay. When you heard that this Scottish guy, Andy Murray, hired Amlie to be his coach, what were your thoughts?	6447_9.q	30.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6447_10	Yeah, I was. I was (smiling).	6447_10.a	2014-06-23	F	6447	nan	Venus Williams	Just wondering what the Body issue shoot was like? Sounds like in the article that was attached that you were surprised that it was going to be like that.	6447_10.q	30.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6447_11	Yeah. I just kept cracking jokes and that definitely made it fun. It was interesting, though. I think I'm in better shape now. Hope we can do a reshoot (smiling).	6447_11.a	2014-06-23	F	6447	nan	Venus Williams	Was it fun?	6447_11.q	30.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6447_12	For Wimbledon, I think they always listen to the players. The women have you know, the tour has voiced our opinion on equal coverage on the courts. I don't think we want more or less. It's so wonderful that Wimbledon listens to not only the women's players but the men's players and all the players. It's just wonderful to have that dialogue back and forth.	6447_12.a	2014-06-23	F	6447	nan	Venus Williams	Over the years you and Serena and other women who have had great records here have been put on the outer courts a lot. Tomorrow's schedule came out and there's two women's matches on Centre Court and Court No.1.	6447_12.q	30.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6447_13	Yeah, I'm on the council so I'm always involved in many things that is involved in the majors, all the tournaments. That's pretty much it.	6447_13.a	2014-06-23	F	6447	nan	Venus Williams	You were involved in the prize money discussions here. Was the court placement also something that you were involved with or the WTA council, to your knowledge?	6447_13.q	30.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6447_14	I think I did it because Serena did it, so... I don't know (laughter). I think she was a big influence on me.	6447_14.a	2014-06-23	F	6447	nan	Venus Williams	Back to the Body issue. How were you approached to do this and why did you do it?	6447_14.q	30.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6447_15	No, I don't know who I'm playing yet.	6447_15.a	2014-06-23	F	6447	nan	Venus Williams	Do you have any idea about your next opponent?	6447_15.q	30.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6447_16	Well, I just try to get there myself. I mean, like at the French Open, Serena and I both theoretically should have been in the third round but it didn't happen. At the end of the day you have to get yourself in the round. You have to put the ball in. If you don't, then you're gone. That's my whole thing nowadays: I got to get it in. That's pretty much it.	6447_16.a	2014-06-23	F	6447	nan	Venus Williams	So when you play someone you know almost nothing about, do you usually try to find out about your opponent or just go out and stick to your tennis?	6447_16.q	30.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6447_17	Well, it's definitely different. I mean, the ball sits up a lot. I don't know. I think what I enjoyed about all the surfaces is that they are different and that's what makes it challenging. If you want to be a great grass court player, you have to adjust. If you want to be a great clay court player, you have to adjust. The hard courts, all of them are a little bit different. I do miss having that nuance of here is the challenge, you have to be a diverse player. Unfortunately I think the courts are becoming so similar that it's not encouraging players to play different.	6447_17.a	2014-06-23	F	6447	nan	Venus Williams	How frustrating is it that the courts are so much slower here than they were when you first played here?	6447_17.q	30.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6447_18	I try not to complain too much. No one's going to want to see me coming. There she goes again, she talks too much. I try not to let that be me.	6447_18.a	2014-06-23	F	6447	nan	Venus Williams	You said Wimbledon always listened. Have you made that point and do they listen?	6447_18.q	30.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6447_19	Yeah, trying to conserve is not the right mentality because you really have to go out there and give it your all. You really just have to play smart. I think that's probably a better way to put it, is really play smart, be focused, be intense. Hopefully that helps you get on and off the court. That's never a guarantee. Today I thought I played pretty well. But a shot here, a shot there, the set is over. So you just have to somehow come through.	6447_19.a	2014-06-23	F	6447	nan	Venus Williams	Is it possible to go into a tournament or match and think you'd like to conserve energy? Is that a dangerous thing to think?	6447_19.q	30.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6447_20	More recently, definitely the Olympics here was the best moment.	6447_20.a	2014-06-23	F	6447	nan	Venus Williams	So many years at this place, so many moments. If you could choose one favorite moment from when you were young or more recently, which one would you choose?	6447_20.q	30.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6447_21	It was awesome. That was my whole thing in life at the time, was to be at the Olympics. It just meant a lot for me personally. Of course, to do it with Serena, it's much more special than to win one alone. That's probably the best moment in my career, I would say.	6447_21.a	2014-06-23	F	6447	nan	Venus Williams	What was that like?	6447_21.q	30.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6447_22	I'm not really here to surprise anyone. No one is going to get behind you and pet you and say, It's okay, you can do it. I have to do that for myself. I'm not looking for anyone to believe in me or anything like that. You have to believe in yourself these days. I have nothing to prove, nothing to hide, nothing to lose. So for me it's about continually playing better and getting back up every single time when things might not go my way. It's not going to go the way of 127 people in this draw. It's going to go the way of one person. So you just keep going.	6447_22.a	2014-06-23	F	6447	nan	Venus Williams	When you came off court, you spoke about the need to stay hungry. Do you still have that hunger for the titles inside you? Do you think, I'd love to surprise a few people in this tournament and go as far as you can?	6447_22.q	30.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
535_0	Yeah, you said it. It brings back those memories of a great summer for both of us. Yeah, just all the matches we've played against one another. More importantly for me, yeah, like you said, I'm very happy to be in the semis again. The road is long getting here. But still I feel like I'm fresh and I've got energy left in the tank for hopefully a great match with Andy and then we'll see. But I'm looking forward to it.	535_0.a	2015-07-08	M	535	Gilles Simon	Roger Federer	How does it feel to be back here in the semifinals playing Andy at Wimbledon? Which memories does it bring back from the summer of 2012?	535_0.q	2.0	1	Quarterfinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
535_1	The results really are the ones that are going to answer that question. If I go out in the semis, then definitely not, you know. But if I do make it to the finals, then we can talk about that. It's been good so far. I felt like I played a very solid last year or so, especially on the grass I've done very well. I'm happy to keep it up here now. This is obviously now crunch time when you want to show if your game's really up to par.	535_1.a	2015-07-08	M	535	Gilles Simon	Roger Federer	It's difficult to compare because you played so long, but you look as if you're playing as well and with as much ease as you've ever played. Is that how you feel?	535_1.q	2.0	1	Quarterfinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
535_2	Yeah, the finals, there was a lot on the line with Andy. I think he was going for his first Wimbledon in '12. So obviously it was always going to be tough. He had lost some majors before that. But I knew it was going to be difficult for me, too, because we were both playing very well. Very much at home on Centre Court, on grass. We both play very well. So, yeah, I mean, it was tricky because there was rain, then the roof closed I think midway through the second. I don't remember, maybe the third. So that was tricky I remember. Then the Olympics was just a different vibe altogether. It was I guess tougher to make the finals because it was bestofthree, not bestoffive getting to the finals. Once there, with the epic I had against del Potro, I was just a bit weathered, you know, from that match, but very relieved that I was going to make a medal for Switzerland. I thought Andy played as good of a final as you can play. Never really had a chance. Don't remember even if I had breakpoints or chances in the second. Honestly, it all went by so quickly. He was just better. That was it. I was happy that I played still a good Olympics after all. But there's nothing I could really do. Then I thought World Tour Finals, he came in tired. You know, he had won three tournaments backtobacktoback. He left everything out there, making the World Tour Finals. I think when I played him, he was a bit cooked, to be honest. I played a great match, but it was not the Andy that usually comes up and shows up.	535_2.a	2015-07-08	M	535	Gilles Simon	Roger Federer	The summer of 2012, what are the memories that have stayed with you the most from those matches with the different results against Andy? Then your most recent match in December in the ATP year end?	535_2.q	2.0	1	Quarterfinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
535_3	Yes, I've heard of it. But then again, I don't keep count when I'm out there. I'm just trying to focus on the next service game, on the next point, the next serve. I'm happy it lasted as long as it did. At the same time, I'm also relieved that I did get a break. I guess we're not going to talk about that anymore and I can just focus, even in here, on the normal things. Not whether I'm going to hold serve or not. Because holding serve is not going to really do much for now. But it's been a great streak. It goes to show what I'm doing off the baseline on my serve, or servevolleying, the way I'm hitting it and placing it seems to work, especially on the grass now.	535_3.a	2015-07-08	M	535	Gilles Simon	Roger Federer	You set a record for yourself holding serve for 116 consecutive service games. How pleased are you with your serving? Are you aware of these streaks while you're playing?	535_3.q	2.0	1	Quarterfinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
535_4	No, not really. I mean, it could be great for the first two service games. Next thing you know, you get a bad service game, or the other guy picks the right sides, connects well. You make some mental errors or some unforced errors. You get a little bit unlucky on the grass. That can happen very quickly. So, I mean, let's be honest, the serve is not just the serve. So much more to it. But I know you guys can talk about shot placement of the serve. The serve is only as good as your baseline game after as well, how good you cover the rest. I don't serve 140s, let's be honest. I have to work my way through those service games.	535_4.a	2015-07-08	M	535	Gilles Simon	Roger Federer	If we could continue talking about it for one more moment. Is there something when you're in a match, maybe at the beginning of a match, that lets you know your serve is as good as it can be and that you're going to have a successful day?	535_4.q	2.0	1	Quarterfinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
535_5	I mean, I might probably disagree with you that just because I beat him six in a row now means I love to play the guy. He's a tough player to play against. Swirly out there today. Didn't quite know if that was going to work for my serve and how good does he really return on grass. I hadn't known that before. I've had some tough matches with him at the French and at Australia, as well, over five sets. He's been tough for me. I still feel that even though today was a convincing win, I still think he's tough for me.	535_5.a	2015-07-08	M	535	Gilles Simon	Roger Federer	Against Gilles, you haven't lost to him in a long time. You've beaten him six times in a row. What is it about his game that perhaps suits you? Is it the flat ball that comes to your favorite height level, the speed of the ball, his serve?	535_5.q	2.0	1	Quarterfinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
535_6	So right now I watch quite a bit just because I also kind of want to know what's been going on a little bit. That's why I've been checking scores. I don't know the Djokovic score. Yeah, I try to be aware. I watch it more as a fan than trying to analyze Gasquet now or Cilic or Murray. I really just watch it more because it's nice to watch good matches. Then once the tournament is over, I'm home, I don't watch any tennis at all. It's pretty much in phases. So, yeah, I enjoy it now.	535_6.a	2015-07-08	M	535	Gilles Simon	Roger Federer	There's a photo of you earlier today looking out on some of the matches from a balcony on the grounds. Stan is playing now. How much tennis do you watch during a tournament when you're still active? How much do you watch when you're not active at a tournament?	535_6.q	2.0	1	Quarterfinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
535_7	Not very much. I was sitting next to the president of the club. I checked in and somebody took a picture. It wasn't like I was watching the whole thing. I would have liked to, but it would have been a bit disrespectful toward my soccer team as well.	535_7.a	2015-07-08	M	535	Gilles Simon	Roger Federer	You watched the French Open final on the phone?	535_7.q	2.0	1	Quarterfinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
535_8	I think actually it was good. Good for me. I don't think it's good for anybody. I kept rolling in the first set. Second set, I came out, served great at 65, 15Love. Ran away with it in the beginning of the third, as well. So today I don't want to say it came in handy, but I definitely came out with the right game plans. It's clearly nice also in a rain delay, you can argue the other way, but it's nice to be in the lead so you're more relaxed in the rain delay rather than too concerned. But also when you're down, it can be helpful to just talk to your team. I'm happy I came out and kept serving well. Actually a really good serving day. You're never quite sure if that's going to continue. I had a good rhythm.	535_8.a	2015-07-08	M	535	Gilles Simon	Roger Federer	How did the rain delays affect you?	535_8.q	2.0	1	Quarterfinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
535_9	Well, I just hope the crowd gets into it and enjoys a good match and that we can play well. Yeah, I have received a lot of crowd support over the years, and so has Andy. So it really probably depends a little bit on who is in the crowd there that day and who they prefer to win. But they're always very friendly and fair. I've always enjoyed playing here, even against Andy, of course.	535_9.a	2015-07-08	M	535	Gilles Simon	Roger Federer	When you play Andy, even in London you seem to get a lot of crowd support. How would you expect that to pan out on Friday? How much of a difference does it really make?	535_9.q	2.0	1	Quarterfinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
535_10	We'll see. He's beaten me before with that second serve. Can't be that bad. He's beaten so many guys so many times. You know what I mean? He covers it very well. He's fast on his feet. He reads it well. One of the greatest return players we have in the game. He's got a great first serve. We'll see. I haven't seen enough, like I said, here of Andy, to be quite honest. Some, probably the most against Karlovic. Yeah, it's tough to judge that, you know. He came through convincingly again, so he must be playing well. Plus he won Queen's. He's in full flight right now.	535_10.a	2015-07-08	M	535	Gilles Simon	Roger Federer	During the BBC commentary of Andy's game, there was a debate of whether his second serve was good enough against the top players. That is an area you might target when you play him?	535_10.q	2.0	1	Quarterfinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
535_11	I don't look at it, to be honest, because the trophy, you only get to see it for an hour. That's what we all play for, funny enough (smiling). But there is some boards around with winners' names, and even those I don't look at. I'm very proud of my achievements here, don't get me wrong. But it's not like something I walk around beating my chest saying like, I'm great here. I don't see it that way. I see it more as a privilege being here.	535_11.a	2015-07-08	M	535	Gilles Simon	Roger Federer	You've had the experience seven times of looking at the trophy and seeing your name on it. When you look at that, what goes through your mind?	535_11.q	2.0	1	Quarterfinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
535_12	You make it sound worse than it is (laughter).	535_12.a	2015-07-08	M	535	Gilles Simon	Roger Federer	You played here now in three decades.	535_12.q	2.0	1	Quarterfinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
535_13	Just that tennis always seemed to be doing well, you know. Every champion who won this event has walked away with a memory of a lifetime. Plus even the ones who didn't still felt it was a privilege to play here, still were marked by it. I once said, just by playing Wimbledon alone would have given me so many moments and memories in my life, there would have been plenty. Okay, I went around the world and play another thousand matches around the world. But the matches I played here were always very, very special. In '99 or just today, it's still very cool to play. I feel like the tournament has changed and became more modern, the roof, rebuilt the entire Centre Court, more digital now, more social media now. Everything has come alive. It's changed quite a bit since. New courts have been built. They're really pushing forward and trying to stay up with what's going on in the world. Yeah, but still keeping the tradition, which I think is so important here at Wimbledon.	535_13.a	2015-07-08	M	535	Gilles Simon	Roger Federer	I'm wondering looking back on those years what you see as the most outstanding characters of this tournament venue?	535_13.q	2.0	1	Quarterfinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3385_0	Yeah, it wasn't easy match. Kuznetsova is a great player and such a great champion. I didn't expect to play this well and have this scoreline, but I did execute balls and my shots very good, which I'm very happy about. I was serving well and stayed calm and returning really well and putting her under pressure. I hit a lot of deep balls, which I was very pleased about.	3385_0.a	2011-10-03	F	3385	Svetlana Kuznetsova	Ana Ivanovic	First of all, congratulations. Tonight's opponent is very tough, but you performed very well. Can you summarize tonight's match a little bit? Thank you.	3385_0.q	18.0	1	2nd Round	CHINA OPEN	Premier
3385_1	One of the toughest moments was definitely pulling out of Olympics here back in '08. It was very hard because I was very excited to be here and to play. I was injured and I was struggling for a while. It was just after I won French Open and became No.1. I wasn't able to practice or play and perform, so that was very, very hard.	3385_1.a	2011-10-03	F	3385	Svetlana Kuznetsova	Ana Ivanovic	(Through translation.) I would like to ask what is your toughest moment in your professional career and how did you go through it?	3385_1.q	18.0	1	2nd Round	CHINA OPEN	Premier
3385_2	I always have great support here, and it's so nice to be back. Lots of people come to my practice and they a yell out things even in Serbian. It's amazing how much support I get here. I'm very pleased, and it helps me perform better.	3385_2.a	2011-10-03	F	3385	Svetlana Kuznetsova	Ana Ivanovic	(Through translation.) Just now on court, some Chinese fans have sung some songs to cheer for you. How would you comment on the support of Chinese fans?	3385_2.q	18.0	1	2nd Round	CHINA OPEN	Premier
3385_3	I think it's great for women's tennis and just being a woman in general. So many times we see models in magazines, and that's a little bit different than most of the girls and women look like. I think it's much healthier being strong, and I think in a way that's beautiful. I think that's a great way to promote women's tennis. We are athletes after all, but we are yet women.	3385_3.a	2011-10-03	F	3385	Svetlana Kuznetsova	Ana Ivanovic	(Through translation.) How do you understand the WTA's slogan for this year's Strong is Beautiful campaign?	3385_3.q	18.0	1	2nd Round	CHINA OPEN	Premier
3385_4	Yeah, we did. We played against each other just a few weeks -- a few months ago in San Diego. It was tough match. It was 6-4 in third set. So if I do play her, it's going to be another very tough match. It's such a tough draw. There are no easy matches. I just want to go out there and try to do the best I can and try to perform like I did tonight.	3385_4.a	2011-10-03	F	3385	Svetlana Kuznetsova	Ana Ivanovic	In the next round you will probably play Vera Zvonareva, the Russian top player. Have you ever met on the court before, and can you give us some thoughts on her?	3385_4.q	18.0	1	2nd Round	CHINA OPEN	Premier
3385_5	Beginning of the season was tough for me. I had a few injuries I battled. Since Wimbledon, since I got a new team with me, new coach and fitness coach, things are much better. I really feel I'm on the right path. I did have some great weeks and great tournaments. I can already see progress in my game since I started implementing these things. You know, until the end of the year, I really want to focus on just enjoying my tennis and trying to apply things that I do on the practice court. Then I think next year it's going to be a big one.	3385_5.a	2011-10-03	F	3385	Svetlana Kuznetsova	Ana Ivanovic	Currently we're pretty much at the end of the season. How are you going to assess your whole performance for this year? We know you haven't won any titles this season. How are you going to evaluate this whole season?	3385_5.q	18.0	1	2nd Round	CHINA OPEN	Premier
3385_6	I think it's very tough question. Well, I think we, as girls, we do like to follow fashion. Obviously if you ask any girl, she would tell you that her favorite thing to do is go shopping. I think there are few girls out there that have always very different style. Some of them are really creative, like Mattek. She always comes with crazy outfits. There are other girls that are very nicely dressed, which is good to see.	3385_6.a	2011-10-03	F	3385	Svetlana Kuznetsova	Ana Ivanovic	(Through translation.) I would like to ask you of all the players at WTA Tour, who do think is the most fashionable? In your own life, what do you think of fashion?	3385_6.q	18.0	1	2nd Round	CHINA OPEN	Premier
3385_7	Well, I wish I knew answer to that question, when it's going to happen. I mean, obviously I want it to happen as soon as possible. I really feel I'm playing sometimes really like a top player. Then again, rankings don't lie. I had tough first half of the year. Like I said it's a progress and a process. I have to be patient. But things are falling into place, and I'm really happy the way everything is going. I'm enjoying competing, and that's what makes a big difference, being happy out there and just enjoying competition.	3385_7.a	2011-10-03	F	3385	Svetlana Kuznetsova	Ana Ivanovic	Currently your ranking is No.18. How far do you think you are with the top player, No.1 and No.2? As a former No.1, how long until you'll be back in top 10?	3385_7.q	18.0	1	2nd Round	CHINA OPEN	Premier
3385_8	Well, my best friend is Crstea, Sorana, from Romania. We're really good friends. There are a few other really nice girls. For next year's Olympics, I'm planning to play mixed doubles, so I'm not going to probably play doubles. It's going to be too much.	3385_8.a	2011-10-03	F	3385	Svetlana Kuznetsova	Ana Ivanovic	(Through translation.) On the WTA Tour, who is your best friend? In next year's London Olympics, do you have any plan of playing doubles?	3385_8.q	18.0	1	2nd Round	CHINA OPEN	Premier
3385_9	Probably Zimonjic.	3385_9.a	2011-10-03	F	3385	Svetlana Kuznetsova	Ana Ivanovic	Who is your partner?	3385_9.q	18.0	1	2nd Round	CHINA OPEN	Premier
3748_0	I wouldn't use the word maybe surprised to be necessarily honest. Happy about it, that's for sure. Excited about it. You know, we can sit here probably pretty long and go through the last 16, 17 months again of my tennis career. You know, having a pretty tough surgery to come back from, it's never easy; and the hip is definitely -- it wasn't easy or is not easy. When you get a little bit older and you haven't been around for quite some time, and to re-find your game once again it's quite a challenge that I took up once again because I still feel like I've got some good tennis in me and I want to try to start playing the sport on my own terms. So to be here in the third round once again is a great feeling.	3748_0.a	2011-09-01	M	3748	Alejandro Falla	Tommy Haas	How surprised are you to be here after what recent history has been like for you?	3748_0.q	475.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
3748_1	Yeah, it does definitely. I don't know in what way yet. But, you know, I'm just certainly gonna try to just enjoy this tournament, try to get focused for my next match, and try to play better each time - or try to play to my potential as much as I can and see where it takes me, and then, you know, re-evaluate the situation after this tournament.	3748_1.a	2011-09-01	M	3748	Alejandro Falla	Tommy Haas	Does this comeback have a different feeling from the others?	3748_1.q	475.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
3748_2	It's tough to say exactly where I feel like it is. A lot of ups and downs the last eight tournaments I've played. Some matches I felt like I was improving, and then I played a couple matches where I felt like I wasn't. This tournament, you know, which means probably the most to me, you know, I've slowly improved. I think my first-round match was pretty good at times. Still struggling in a few areas that I need to work on, but today I thought overall was a pretty solid match on my part. I'm pretty happy about that.	3748_2.a	2011-09-01	M	3748	Alejandro Falla	Tommy Haas	Where do you feel your game is now?	3748_2.q	475.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
3748_3	You know, to be honest, when you're a young kid and you have a dream to become a tennis professional and you actually do it for a very long time, I'm very happy and very pleased. Yeah, you know, it's a tough sport. The sport getting more physical each year I feel like. Unfortunately I have had a few surgeries in my career or a few injuries that needed surgery, you know. It's unfortunate in many ways, but I've coped with it quite well. I've come back in better ways than I would have ever imagined. You know, now this, after this hip injury or surgery, you know, being a certain age, it's another challenge that I'm happy to take on as long as I can. I know that one day this tour life that I've always wanted to do is gonna be over, so I'm just gonna try and enjoy it as much as I can and keep playing if my body allows me to.	3748_3.a	2011-09-01	M	3748	Alejandro Falla	Tommy Haas	When you sort of think about your career, do you feel unlucky? Is it something mechanical? Is it biological? How do you sort of make sense of what your career has been like from the injury standpoint?	3748_3.q	475.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
3748_4	It changes your life not only because I'm a tennis professional, but once you have more responsibilities and you look in your baby's eyes, you know, different thoughts come into your mind. It's probably one of the most wonderful things in anybody's life that it happens to. You know, it gives me another reason to work hard and try to achieve some things. You know, my long-time goal would be nice if my daughter could watch me play tennis live which is gonna be hard because she's only nine-and-a-half months. So that means I'm gonna have to be around quite some time. We'll see, you know. You have to have some sort of goals in life, and that's certainly one of them.	3748_4.a	2011-09-01	M	3748	Alejandro Falla	Tommy Haas	How has having a family changed things for you?	3748_4.q	475.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
3748_5	Sure. You know, if you count up all the months I've missed due to injuries or surgeries that I've had, I mean, I'm probably 29 years old really, you know, but like I said, you have to just take everything the way it is and make the best of it and go from there.	3748_5.a	2011-09-01	M	3748	Alejandro Falla	Tommy Haas	Did you feel maybe you bought some time on the back end because you had so many years where you didn't put a lot of mileage on?	3748_5.q	475.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
3748_6	I have two passports.	3748_6.a	2011-09-01	M	3748	Alejandro Falla	Tommy Haas	Can you just give us an update on your citizenship? For a while seemed like you were bouncing around there a little.	3748_6.q	475.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
3748_7	Yeah, just Germany right now. I thought about switching it over to the U.S., especially during this tournament, but, you know, I've had so many other things to think about lately with family and where my game is and if I am ready, a new coach, I'm looking for a physio. There are so many things I didn't have time to maybe focus on who I want to represent here. But I thought about it.	3748_7.a	2011-09-01	M	3748	Alejandro Falla	Tommy Haas	Who are you representing? You're playing here as a German?	3748_7.q	475.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
3748_8	Just one phone call to the ATP and then that's it. They change it, no problem. I'm trying to see if they can put American/German, you know, like present two flags, but I don't think that's gonna happen.	3748_8.a	2011-09-01	M	3748	Alejandro Falla	Tommy Haas	What do you have to do? What's the process?	3748_8.q	475.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
2245_0	Well, the end and the start weren't particularly good, but the middle part was very good. So, you know, obviously happy I managed to close the match out in two sets. I lost my concentration towards the end, but, yeah, I'll, you know, focus on what I did well. Today I hit the ball much better from the baseline than I did in the first match. You know, just make sure that that sort of slip in concentration doesn't happen again.	2245_0.a	2009-03-30	M	2245	Nicolas Massu	Andy Murray	What did you make of that?	2245_0.q	4.0	1	3rd Round	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters 1000
2245_1	Yeah, I mean, providing you can obviously keep winning and upping your game each time you need to. Obviously I was behind in the match today in the first one, and I found a way to come back and played well when I needed to. You know, obviously everyone would want to play their best all the time, but it's not, you know, always going to be the case. If you watched Nadal's match today he struggled a bit, but he finds a way to get through. He gets himself back in the match. That's what you need to do. Hopefully come the later stages of the tournament you're going to be playing your best.	2245_1.a	2009-03-30	M	2245	Nicolas Massu	Andy Murray	You said in the past it's just a case of really getting through these earlier rounds and that sometimes it might not be pretty. But if you're in the fourth round, that is what it's all about.	2245_1.q	4.0	1	3rd Round	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters 1000
2245_2	At the start of the match he was having some huge forehands, and I was directing a bit too many balls sort of towards his backhand. Lost of the Spanish players and Argentinians, they like to hit their forehands from the backhand side of the court. You know, it's a tactic that most guys use on clay. You know, I was giving him that shot a little too often, so I started to play a few more balls into his forehand, and then opened up the rest of court to play to his backhand. Once I got there, I managed to dictate a few more points and play a bit for aggressive when I got the first hit in.	2245_2.a	2009-03-30	M	2245	Nicolas Massu	Andy Murray	Did you tailor what you did specifically to him? You didn't seem to give him much pace, for instance.	2245_2.q	4.0	1	3rd Round	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters 1000
2245_3	It happens sometimes. I mean, I'm sure sometimes when you're sort of writing a story or...	2245_3.a	2009-03-30	M	2245	Nicolas Massu	Andy Murray	You said you lost concentration at the end. In hindsight, have you any idea why?	2245_3.q	4.0	1	3rd Round	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters 1000
2245_4	You know, your mind drifts a little bit, especially when it's coming -- it was obviously a long way -- the standard of the match had gone down a little bit. His head was down, and I just missed a few shots. Sometimes it happens. It's tough to concentrate all the time, and I lost my concentration.	2245_4.a	2009-03-30	M	2245	Nicolas Massu	Andy Murray	No.	2245_4.q	4.0	1	3rd Round	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters 1000
2245_5	No. I didn't even realize he had done.	2245_5.a	2009-03-30	M	2245	Nicolas Massu	Andy Murray	Can you recall the last time a guy served four successive doubles against you?	2245_5.q	4.0	1	3rd Round	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters 1000
2245_6	No, probably hasn't happened for a while. You know, occasionally obviously, you know, guys will serve, you know, a whole game of doubles, and it probably happens once or twice a year. Yeah, first time it's happened to me.	2245_6.a	2009-03-30	M	2245	Nicolas Massu	Andy Murray	The three in the 4-All and then the first game of the second set he served a double, as well.	2245_6.q	4.0	1	3rd Round	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters 1000
2245_7	Well, I mean, they've obviously both -- Monaco, before he got a bad illness last year, you know, was ranked around 40 or 50 in the world and was starting to come back a bit. Obviously it's tough sometimes to close matches out, you know. I think he's a pretty he mentally strong player. Massu, obviously having won Olympics and stuff he can obviously play well in big matches. No, I mean, it's not something that you expect to happen. Sometimes, yeah, guys get a bit nervous towards the end of sets or when you get ahead a little bit, and you just have to make sure that you up your game at that moment. It's not something that you expect to happen. I think if you do that it doesn't -- it's pretty easy to get sort of complacent and get behind.	2245_7.a	2009-03-30	M	2245	Nicolas Massu	Andy Murray	With both these opponents, did you have the sense that both of them could wobble mentally at certain times of the match, and it was a question of drawing the sting and waiting for them to mentally get a bit shaky?	2245_7.q	4.0	1	3rd Round	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters 1000
2245_8	Well, I mean, he's a bit more consistent than he used to be. He's always been a dangerous player. If you look at his results against some of the higher-ranked guys, you know, sometimes he could lose comfortably and sometimes he would have some very close matches. You know, when I played him again at the Australian Open, I mean, I didn't play my best match, but he obviously had a great tournament. You know, I think if you have worked very hard physically it improves -- you sort of mentally -- maybe he's feeling like he can stay in the point a bit longer so he doesn't have to go for huge winners like he used to. But his technique and game and stuff hasn't changed a whole lot. I just think he's just more consistent. He was ranked in the top 20 beforehand, so he's obviously still a very good player. He's just upped it one level.	2245_8.a	2009-03-30	M	2245	Nicolas Massu	Andy Murray	Obviously in the off-season you did a lot of training and got really fit, and so it Fernando Verdasco. Did you notice anything different about Fernando when you played him earlier this year, or maybe in the few years past? Did he improve any way mentally, physically in your opinion?	2245_8.q	4.0	1	3rd Round	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters 1000
2245_9	No, I don't think so. I didn't play particularly well there last year, you know. But, I mean, the first time I played here I was obviously still very, very young. You know, I think I lost to Ancic last year, and then I can't remember what happened the year -- I think I lost in the semis to Djokovic. So I don't know what the indifferent performance was. Maybe the match last year. I had a match point against Ancic, and he's obviously a tough player, but I don't think that the court should make any difference on the outcome of the match.	2245_9.a	2009-03-30	M	2245	Nicolas Massu	Andy Murray	We think you're playing on the grandstand tomorrow against Troicki. I think it's safe to say you've had a couple of indifferent performances out there. Is it much different playing in the boondocks compared to on center?	2245_9.q	4.0	1	3rd Round	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters 1000
2245_10	Yeah.	2245_10.a	2009-03-30	M	2245	Nicolas Massu	Andy Murray	You've played Troicki once before?	2245_10.q	4.0	1	3rd Round	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters 1000
2245_11	Well, he's playing well this week. He obviously had a very good win against Nalbandian. He played well last year I think, as well. Or maybe the year before he had a close match with Roddick. You know, he's quick. He's got a big serve. You know, I'll have to play solid and choose my moments to be aggressive, you know, try and change the pace of the ball. Because if you keep playing the same way against, him he's very solid. I'll have to do that.	2245_11.a	2009-03-30	M	2245	Nicolas Massu	Andy Murray	What do you anticipate the match is going to be like?	2245_11.q	4.0	1	3rd Round	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters 1000
4482_0	I think as the match went on I probably became a little bit more comfortable, got used to her spin and maybe the wind a little bit more. It was tricky out there during the first set, and when it's tight, you know, it's hard to really kick start something. I think once I got that first set then I maybe relaxed a little bit more. Once I got that break and then started to maybe see what was going on a bit more it became a little bit more easier for me.	4482_0.a	2012-08-31	F	4482	Varvara Lepchenko	Samantha Stosur	First and second sets were almost like different matches. What was the difference between the two of them?	4482_0.q	7.0	1	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4482_1	Yeah, I think that was something that really picked up as the match went on. Aside from that first service game, I felt like I served very well. As that first set went on and then throughout that second set I held pretty comfortably throughout. I think as I was doing that, then I would put a bit more pressure on her service games. That's kind of how the match unfolded. That's how I was able to get that run of games on the second set.	4482_1.a	2012-08-31	F	4482	Varvara Lepchenko	Samantha Stosur	Must be really pleased with the serving, Sam.	4482_1.q	7.0	1	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4482_2	Yeah, I think that's probably a good thing. You never know when you're going to run into them. The more times you play against that kind of spin, maybe the easier it gets. You know, I have never played Laura before. She's obviously full of confidence and had two very, very good wins. Definitely can't go into that match slightly. Have to go out there and be on my game and ready to play some good tennis.	4482_2.a	2012-08-31	F	4482	Varvara Lepchenko	Samantha Stosur	You play Laura Robson next. She seems in good form. A lefty. Is it good to get a lefty before another lefty?	4482_2.q	7.0	1	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4482_3	To be honest, no, not really. You know, she hasn't necessarily played too many tournaments that I have been at where, you know, where I have watched. You know, it's a new opponent, and I have to do some homework and talk to my coach a little bit about that. Again, I've got to focus on my game. And maybe there are a few things you can pick up, but at the end of the day I've got to do what I do well.	4482_3.a	2012-08-31	F	4482	Varvara Lepchenko	Samantha Stosur	Have you had a chance to watch any of her matches before?	4482_3.q	7.0	1	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4482_4	For sure it can be a very tricky match. She's probably got nothing to lose. She's had two of probably the best wins of her career, and she's starting to maybe live up to some of that potential that people have talked about from when she won junior Wimbledon when she was 14. Like I said, you can't go into it lightly. You've got to be aware that, you know, she's going to come out swinging maybe and have that confidence behind her, but you've got to stick to your own guns play the way that you need to play. When it comes down to the crunch, back yourself. I guess we'll see how the match unfolds, but I have got to go in there focused on what I need to do.	4482_4.a	2012-08-31	F	4482	Varvara Lepchenko	Samantha Stosur	How dangerous is it when you play a player like her since she's on a hot streak, 18 years old, must be brimming with confidence coming off the defeat of Li Na?	4482_4.q	7.0	1	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4482_5	I think it helps. It can help a lot. I know the first times I played out on Arthur Ashe and Rod Laver Arena, courts like that, it is a little bit more nervewracking. You're not used to those surroundings. Unfortunately I have been out there quite a few times and played in these big matches, which I think can only be good for you once you got you get the confidence under your belt.	4482_5.a	2012-08-31	F	4482	Varvara Lepchenko	Samantha Stosur	When you get deeper into the tournament, playing on center stage, Ashe, how important is it to have had those experiences before such as you have had?	4482_5.q	7.0	1	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4482_6	I'm feeling good. I feel like, you know, I've done everything I need to to get to this position. I thought I played quite well. I have served very well. I'm happy with where I'm at. Of course you always want to improve things. So far, so good.	4482_6.a	2012-08-31	F	4482	Varvara Lepchenko	Samantha Stosur	Are you feeling very confident right now?	4482_6.q	7.0	1	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4482_7	Yeah, I think that can help. I was doing the right things. I thought throughout that set I was serving well and winning my games comfortably and had chances on her service games and wasn't able to capitalize on those. But I think as the match went on, you know, I kept pushing to do what I needed to do. At 5All and then, you know, 65 that last set of the tiebreak, you know, I think that's really where it kind of came out.	4482_7.a	2012-08-31	F	4482	Varvara Lepchenko	Samantha Stosur	That experience you had on Ashe in the past, was that key today at 5All in the breaker?	4482_7.q	7.0	1	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4482_8	I ended up hitting with Kvitova. Just by chance she was there looking and they said that there was no other courts. Managed to practice with her, which is maybe a good thing. Yeah, tomorrow I probably won't be too concerned about it having just played a lefty, but we'll see what happens. Again, you focus on your own game and do whatever you need to do to combat what they're doing once they're out there.	4482_8.a	2012-08-31	F	4482	Varvara Lepchenko	Samantha Stosur	Heading into the Lepchenko match you were hoping to maybe hit with a left hander, and now you have another one. How easy is it to find a lefthanded hitting partner?	4482_8.q	7.0	1	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4482_9	To be honest, I haven't thought about that match. She only won a few minutes ago. Again, I have never really watched her play that much. We have practiced on grass before last year at Wimbledon, but I think it's one of those people that I'm going to have to probably think about a little bit more before I give you a good answer.	4482_9.a	2012-08-31	F	4482	Varvara Lepchenko	Samantha Stosur	Where do you matchup well with Laura, do you think?	4482_9.q	7.0	1	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4482_10	No, I mean, she obviously came out and people started taking notice when she did win junior Wimbledon. Again, I can't say that I saw many of her matches there, and that was quite a while ago now. You know, players evolve as years go by, so I think she's obviously improving and playing very well. I need to take a look and...	4482_10.a	2012-08-31	F	4482	Varvara Lepchenko	Samantha Stosur	Do you know Laura from the Australian tennis system, or was that really one of the first times you had ever...	4482_10.q	7.0	1	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4482_11	It is what it is. Last year there was all sorts of obstacles to get over, and I did that. Worked out okay. You know, this year everything's been pretty straightforward. Two contrasting tournaments at the moment, but, you know, I'll be ready to do with anything if it comes up.	4482_11.a	2012-08-31	F	4482	Varvara Lepchenko	Samantha Stosur	Last year you had rain delays, you were thrown from pillar to post. This year everything is going smoothly. You know when you're playing. Does it feel different this year?	4482_11.q	7.0	1	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4482_12	Oh, I mean, yeah, absolutely. We're not anywhere near each other in the draw, I don't think. You know, I'm not too worried what's going on on that side of the draw at the moment, but she really has gone from strength to strength from this tournament last year and just skyrocketed through the rankings. She's a very good player. Yeah, I'm not necessarily surprised she won last year. I was watching up until 5All in the second set and then I had to go to sleep to be ready for today. I heard it was a pretty good match in the end.	4482_12.a	2012-08-31	F	4482	Varvara Lepchenko	Samantha Stosur	Angelique Kerber, yesterday she won against Venus Williams. What do you think, is she really a hard player here for you?	4482_12.q	7.0	1	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
716_0	As you said, it was very tight.  You know, that's a match that without confidence there's no way I could win.  Going for my shots on set points, it shows just how close tennis is, how quickly it can change, how close all the guys are on tour.  'Cause if you change literally two points in that whole match, it's a completely different match.  If he wins the set points in the first set, four set points in the second, any one of those goes a different way, that's a whole new match. I'm lucky to get through it.  I thought I played well on those set points.  I played smart.  After that I felt like I got my confidence and really got rolling.  That's what happens.  When you're playing confident, you never think you're going to lose those points.  That's the way I felt. It was a good feeling at the end of the match to know that I got through a match where easily it could have been the other way.	716_0.a	2007-01-20	M	716	Robby Ginepri	James Blake	It was very tight early.  What is your assessment of the game?	716_0.q	5.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
716_1	It's a little tough.  He's one of my best friends on tour.  I wish him all the best.  I told him after the match I really think this is going to be a big year for him.  Looking forward to great things. Hopefully we won't have to play each other in the early stage of tournaments.  Looking forward to getting him to being seeded in these Slams, being a real force to be reckoned with like he was a couple years ago. It's tough because I want the best for him, but obviously I've got to go out there and do my job.  I want to win when I'm playing.  No matter who I'm up against, it's tough.  But we're professionals.  We go out there and we do that.  We do our job. If because of this I've got to buy him dinner or a couple of beers tomorrow night or something, so be it.  But that's just the way it is.  I know there will be times throughout our career where he'll get the better of me and I'll hit him up for a dinner the next night or something. We're good friends off the court.  Once it comes to playing, as you could see, we're fighting our hearts out.	716_1.a	2007-01-20	M	716	Robby Ginepri	James Blake	Is it tough to play a guy that you know so well and you're friends with?	716_1.q	5.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
716_2	Yeah, both great players.  That's probably why they've given me problems. Lleyton has proven that he can fight hard no matter how little match practice he has, coming back on Mike Russell.  He's obviously going to have the crowd with him.  That's going to be a tough match-up no matter what. I finally got a little bit off the schneid by beating him last year in Las Vegas.  That was a great feeling.  He got me back on the grass.  Interesting to play him on the Rebound Ace again and see who's playing better right now. Definitely not an easy match-up in Australia.  But the way I'm playing, I feel good.  Hopefully I can control more of the points against him.  He has a way of sneaking out of a lot of those, so it would be tough. Fernando, a totally different player.  He's going to attack me and take huge rips with the forehand.  We'll definitely have a few battles going forehand to forehand, trying to find each other's backhands. He's given me problems last few times, but I've had some success against him earlier in his career.  Hopefully I can draw on that and get back to the winning ways against him.  He's playing pretty confident right now as well.	716_2.a	2007-01-20	M	716	Robby Ginepri	James Blake	Either way, Gonzlez or Hewitt, two guys that have given you some problems.  Talk about both of them.	716_2.q	5.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
716_3	It's up there as one of the best.  I really have always had a great admiration of Carlos Moya's.  I think his is one of the best.  I think Roger's obviously is incredible.  But Fernando's got to be pretty close to being next up there.  Monfils is showing some flashes of brilliance with his, how hard he can hit it. But I think to take it day in and day out, Fernando's, just from being on tour longer, being on tour longer and more experience, he's proven that his forehand is one of the best in the world, more so than Gal. But you never know in a few years.  It's up there in the top three or four I think.	716_3.a	2007-01-20	M	716	Robby Ginepri	James Blake	Where do you rank his forehand against ones you've faced?	716_3.q	5.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
716_4	I grew up in New England.  I loved it.  I've played an indoor tournament so far.  I think it's been beneficial for me so far.  It could be a detriment, I know, as it comes time to my first match outdoors, whenever that is, if it's Monday. Hopefully I keep going through.  If I play indoors again, Wednesday, whenever it is, just not having that experience where I've been outdoors yet.  I had to go for a run the other day just to be out in the sun and feel like I've worked in the heat 'cause before I came down here, I was practicing indoors in Connecticut. That was part of the reason to play Sydney.  That's part of the reason I was so happy I did so well in Sydney.  I got four matches in the sun, feeling really good in the heat.  Then I come down here and I play three matches indoors.  It's tough to have that experience. Maybe I feel like I'm an indoor player again.  But I got to -- I know I'm going to have to play outdoors here some time.  I hope I'll be able to adjust quickly.  But playing indoors today felt great.  I love it.  I grew up practicing and training indoors.  It's pretty comfortable for me.	716_4.a	2007-01-20	M	716	Robby Ginepri	James Blake	What was it like playing with the roof closed?  Seems a little chilly in there.	716_4.q	5.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
716_5	I definitely had a cramping issue a couple years ago in the French Open against Wawrinka.  That was possibly due to playing an indoor in Tunica, five matches, straight to Forest Hills, five matches on clay, and then flying across the Atlantic to get three matches in quallies, then a first round match, and then the first day that was hot was the day I played Wawrinka.  It was very hot in five sets.  I had a cramping issue. I feel very good about the fact I've done everything I can now to try to stop those problems and hiring Mark Merklein as my trainer.  He's been doing great things in terms of making sure my diet is right, making sure I'm warmed up right, and I have things to eat and keep me hopefully -- balance all my vitamins out on the court. I hope he solved the problem, because it has been a problem in the past dealing with the heat and with going five sets or whatever.  I don't know what it is 'cause I feel like I'm in great shape and I never cramp from being tired, I cramp from -- I really just don't know what it is, whether it's a lack of a certain nutrient or what. But I hope whatever Mark has done has fixed it.  I got full confidence in him, so we'll put it to the test I'm sure in my first outdoor match here.	716_5.a	2007-01-20	M	716	Robby Ginepri	James Blake	Would you say looking back at your career to this point in Slams, has there been any point - aside from the very early times when you had some cramping issues - when the fatigue factor has come into play for the second week for you?	716_5.q	5.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
716_6	He said to me, Let's get a Grand Slam.  That means a lot to me that he really thinks of us as a team.  If he had won, I probably would have said the same thing, that we want to bring a Slam home to the States.  Roger has been hoarding them all in Switzerland.  We'd like to get one back in the States. Then I just said, You're right there, too.  You got the game.  You know you have it.  Just feeling good about it, feeling confident.  'Cause a lot of times that's the difference, a set point here, a set point there, a breakpoint here, a breakpoint there, feeling confident to go for your shots on those.  When you feel confident, it seems like they go in a lot more. He's got that game.  He played top five tennis for six months.  That didn't go anywhere.  It's just a matter of him feeling confident again.  Feeling like he can play that.  I think he's right on the edge.  I think he's right there. I wish him the best.  Coming up we got indoor hard courts in the States, then Indian Wells and Miami.  I look for him to do some damage.	716_6.a	2007-01-20	M	716	Robby Ginepri	James Blake	What did you have to say to Robby right at the net?	716_6.q	5.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
716_7	Lleyton match here?	716_7.a	2007-01-20	M	716	Robby Ginepri	James Blake	What is your memory of that Lleyton match here?	716_7.q	5.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
716_8	Man.	716_8.a	2007-01-20	M	716	Robby Ginepri	James Blake	Yes.	716_8.q	5.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
716_9	It wasn't.  For me it was a great feeling because I had just come back from so many down times, just to be out on the court was a great feeling.  To have some pressure moments, I won the first set, just barely remember that.  The second set, I had a set point. Completely just dumped it back in into the middle of net.  I remember that.  Just the feeling of having the crowd into it, excited.  I think I saved a set point with a big backhand after that.  Just to get that feeling out on the court was great for me. I'm pretty sure I wasn't healthy at that point.  My zoster was still affecting me.  The next week I still didn't feel good.  Then I had my ups and downs for another two or three months where I really wasn't sure I was healthy.  When I got to San Jose, I remember practicing indoors, not being able to see very well because it was still affecting my vision. For me it was just so great to be out there and feeling good, the feeling of the crowd, knowing that I could still hopefully do this for a living.  It was tough to lose to Lleyton, but at least I lost to a great player in his home country when he was playing well.  I remember not having so much fun in the third set when he beat me 6-0. I was literally at that point happy to be here.  I know a lot of people say that's a terrible attitude.  You never want to just be happy to be somewhere, you want to win it.  That's the way I feel now.  But at that point I was just happy to be healthy, happy to be playing.  So I have that memory. Of course, I wish I could have won.  But I'm realistic in knowing had I won, I probably would have lost the next round because I wasn't fully healthy at that point.  If I had, it would have been great for me at that point, but I don't think it would have made much difference in my career. It was a matter of waiting till I got healthy, having that patience, dealing with everything else that was going on in my life.  Now the most important thing for me is winning matches.  I feel confident about it.  I hope it will be a different result if I do play him this time.  You never know.  Like I said, he's a great player.	716_9.a	2007-01-20	M	716	Robby Ginepri	James Blake	Wasn't pleasant?	716_9.q	5.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
716_10	Probably not tonight.  I think room service is my plan for tonight.  It's getting late.  If he's still around tomorrow I'll give him a call, and hopefully I can treat him to dinner. I think he's been having good luck so far at the casino.  Hopefully that will rub off on me, and maybe we'll go put down a few bets and have some fun.	716_10.a	2007-01-20	M	716	Robby Ginepri	James Blake	Did you say you're going to go out with Robby for dinner?	716_10.q	5.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
716_11	I've been playing some baccarat and a little blackjack.  I love baccarat a lot.  It hasn't been treating me well this year.  Most years I've done well here.  I need to change the luck a little.	716_11.a	2007-01-20	M	716	Robby Ginepri	James Blake	What do you play?	716_11.q	5.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
716_12	As long as Patrick McEnroe wants me on the team, I'll be there.  I hope he wants me.  I feel like I've been playing pretty well.  This team has come together great with Andy, myself, the Bryans.  I'm looking forward to it, yeah.  It's going to be a quick change going from Rebound Ace to hard to clay.  It's probably going to be the same for them. We're looking forward to winning a clay away tie, which has been a bit of our kryptonite in years past.  But I'm looking forward to it.  The guys are a great group of guys.  It's a long trip, but we're going to get over there as early as we can, be prepared.  Just having two guys, myself and Andy, playing so confidently right now, I like our chances.  The Bryans for us put so much confidence in us that they're going to get that doubles point. I like our chances.  I just really love -- that's another thing I've missed when I was hurt and sick, is being a part of that team.  I just love it.  As long as I'm available and healthy, Patrick McEnroe wants me on the team, I'll be there.	716_12.a	2007-01-20	M	716	Robby Ginepri	James Blake	Are you playing Davis Cup against Czech Republic?	716_12.q	5.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
716_13	I wouldn't say a heavy favorite.  Anything can happen in Davis Cup.  There aren't many heavy favorites ever in Davis Cup, especially away.  The crowds can get to you.  The surface can be tricky.  Anything can happen.  When you have a player as talented as Tomas Berdych, it's not we're a heavy favorite. Like I said, I really like our chances, with how much our team has come together, how much we enjoy being around each other.  I've always felt those are the types of team that overachieve.  Just the fact that we really care about how each other's doing.  If I'm in my room, if Andy's playing, that's the only thing on my TV.  I'm watching him, hoping he's doing well, living and dying on his points.  I really think he's doing the same.  The Bryans are the first ones -- when I get back to my hotel room, I have a feeling I'll have a message from them saying, Good job tonight.  When I see them playing, it's the same thing. We all care about each other.  It's hopefully a team that's going to overachieve.  I'd like to think we're a favorite to win it.  It's tough to say that with an away tie.	716_13.a	2007-01-20	M	716	Robby Ginepri	James Blake	Do you feel like U.S. team is heavy favorite?	716_13.q	5.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
716_14	I've never been to Czech Republic.  I've heard Prague is beautiful.  Haven't heard too much about Ostrava.  We'll see.  I hear we're playing in a hockey rink, 3,000 people.	716_14.a	2007-01-20	M	716	Robby Ginepri	James Blake	Have you ever been to Czech Republic?	716_14.q	5.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
716_15	Great, even better.  Hopefully they'll fill it and we'll have some fun.  I'll learn something about the Czech Republic.  It's for me another perk of the job, getting to see new places, learn new cultures, hopefully win a few matches.	716_15.a	2007-01-20	M	716	Robby Ginepri	James Blake	6,000.	716_15.q	5.0	1	3rd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4154_0	Yeah, I think I start to not feel well since yesterday night, and when I woke up this morning I knew I was not in great shape. But I give it a try on the court. I think more the match was going on the worse it was getting for me and I was feeling extremely dizzy on the court and I don't see very clearly. You know, I think I get the virus that a lot of player got in here. So it's very unfortunate, but there is nothing I can do about it. It's basically a matter of a chance of getting it or not getting it. Obviously it hit me.	4154_0.a	2012-03-15	F	4154	Ana Ivanovic	Marion Bartoli	Sorry to hear you're not feeling well. Can you just tell me a bit about what happened in the match?	4154_0.q	7.0	0	Quarterfinals	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
4154_1	Well, when I went on the court, I was, you know, very dizzy and it was very hard for me to catch my breath. Even though we didn't have very long rallies, I was feeling really out of breath and short of breath. And then I was having a lot of joint pains and feeling shaky and very cold. It was quite hot, so I knew I was not in a good shape. I just tried my hardest and under the circumstances and tried to do not retire during the match and still show everyone that I could complete the match. Even though I lost it, I just felt like I needed to stay there until the end.	4154_1.a	2012-03-15	F	4154	Ana Ivanovic	Marion Bartoli	Do you have a temperature right now?	4154_1.q	7.0	0	Quarterfinals	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
4154_2	Yeah, it is frustrating, because it's not really one of my mistakes. I didn't eat something bad or do something bad on my side. It was just very unlucky, and obviously it hit me at the end of the tournament, which is better than hit me at the beginning of the tournament. But I wish I had a better immune system or something to do not get it. But it's the way it is. And as you say, I still make the quarterfinal which is positive, and try to recover before Miami.	4154_2.a	2012-03-15	F	4154	Ana Ivanovic	Marion Bartoli	After having such a good tournament here and great results again at Indian Wells, it must be a frustrating way for it to end.	4154_2.q	7.0	0	Quarterfinals	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
2382_0	You mean that I started to play better in the second set? Yeah, I did. I was a little bit frustrated in the first set. I did so many unforced errors that I think I shouldn't be doing, and been not moving well to the ball. Was not finding good distance because I didn't move my feet. Still, I had opportunities. It was just basically one break. I had few chances, but definitely Kim played much better than I did first set. Second set I fought hard. She was a break up and I still came back. I started, you know, to play a little better my game. The conditions today, they were extremely hot, so it was not really easy to play your game. You kind of understand why you're not playing so good. In the third set, it was as well one break what broke everything. I think I lost it when I had chances to break her in the start, and it was deuce and I did two unforced errors, which I cannot do in this type of matches. To play Kim, she plays good now. She's in shape. It was good game. You know, it was good experience for me, but I should do much better in the third set.	2382_0.a	2009-08-13	F	2382	Kim Clijsters	Svetlana Kuznetsova	It seemed like you only really got going halfway through the second set. You found your form only in the middle of the second set.	2382_0.q	6.0	0	3rd Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP WOMEN'S OPEN	Premier
2382_1	We spoke with girls in locker room, and it's kind of Kim always been there, you know. It's like she the same as she been before. Tennis-wise, I think she can compare better. She moves well and does well. You can see she haven't been all the time on the tour, but, I mean, she was playing great, and physically she's well.	2382_1.a	2009-08-13	F	2382	Kim Clijsters	Svetlana Kuznetsova	Is it possible to compare how she is now to how she was two years ago?	2382_1.q	6.0	0	3rd Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP WOMEN'S OPEN	Premier
2382_2	Is there time distance between here in Toronto?	2382_2.a	2009-08-13	F	2382	Kim Clijsters	Svetlana Kuznetsova	What will you do now? Stay here for a few days or go straight to Toronto?	2382_2.q	6.0	0	3rd Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP WOMEN'S OPEN	Premier
2382_3	How far is the flight? You ask me questions, can I ask you questions? How far is the flight, two hours?	2382_3.a	2009-08-13	F	2382	Kim Clijsters	Svetlana Kuznetsova	No.	2382_3.q	6.0	0	3rd Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP WOMEN'S OPEN	Premier
2382_4	Maybe I go after tomorrow. I was looking to this water park and this adventure, so maybe I go to check it out so I can have a little bit of a distraction.	2382_4.a	2009-08-13	F	2382	Kim Clijsters	Svetlana Kuznetsova	Hour and a half.	2382_4.q	6.0	0	3rd Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP WOMEN'S OPEN	Premier
2382_5	I mean, it's not easy to play second match Kim after month you been off. But, you know, it happens. This is my draw, and my draw was, I think, really hard. I been working hard and preparing. Normally I need matches to get in, to start to play my game. I feel all right. I think I've done a good job, and I will look forward have more matches before the Open. I hope I have a little bit better draw next week, so...	2382_5.a	2009-08-13	F	2382	Kim Clijsters	Svetlana Kuznetsova	This is your first tournament back. How are you feeling?	2382_5.q	6.0	0	3rd Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP WOMEN'S OPEN	Premier
2382_6	Yeah. Well, I don't know. I felt like cooking on this court, you know, because it's so hot. I felt I better take shower. I didn't care. I could have also go, but we have this opportunity and I don't want to get dizzy. Because in the end first set I felt like I'm getting dizzier, but then it's passed away.	2382_6.a	2009-08-13	F	2382	Kim Clijsters	Svetlana Kuznetsova	Did you ask for a break after the second set?	2382_6.q	6.0	0	3rd Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP WOMEN'S OPEN	Premier
2382_7	I think she has good chances. I think, yeah, I mean, she plays good. And if she's prepared, when a person prepared, everybody can have good chances. She won this title once, and I think she knows how to do it.	2382_7.a	2009-08-13	F	2382	Kim Clijsters	Svetlana Kuznetsova	Do you think Kim Clijsters, for the US Open, she will already be a big contender for it?	2382_7.q	6.0	0	3rd Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP WOMEN'S OPEN	Premier
2382_8	No. I know her. I don't know, you remember she was out for I think the wrist injury. For some injury for so long, and she came back.	2382_8.a	2009-08-13	F	2382	Kim Clijsters	Svetlana Kuznetsova	Were you surprised about her level?	2382_8.q	6.0	0	3rd Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP WOMEN'S OPEN	Premier
2382_9	No. She won Indian Wells and Miami back-to-back. I mean, when she goes out and she comes back she always comes in shape, so I know that.	2382_9.a	2009-08-13	F	2382	Kim Clijsters	Svetlana Kuznetsova	When she won the US Open?	2382_9.q	6.0	0	3rd Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP WOMEN'S OPEN	Premier
681_0	Yeah, I thought I definitely stepped it up.  I had to.  I felt like I was a lot looser.  I was going for my shots a bit more.  I felt like I was a little tentative in my previous matches just tying to find my rhythm. Today when I came on court, I knew she was going to be, you know, a challenge.  I just had to go out there and, uhm, step up to it.	681_0.a	2007-01-22	F	681	Vera Zvonareva	Maria Sharapova	Were you completely happy with your form tonight?	681_0.q	2.0	1	4th Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
681_1	Yeah, obviously it's disappointing in a situation where you don't take care of business after five or six.  But the main thing is that I didn't really let that get in my head.  I was pretty positive about things. She didn't have a breakpoint on my serve until I was up 5-2 in the second.  Those are pretty good stats for my own.	681_1.a	2007-01-22	F	681	Vera Zvonareva	Maria Sharapova	You've had 13 breakpoint opportunities and only converted 3 of them.  Is that a little worry?  Did she get out of them well?	681_1.q	2.0	1	4th Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
681_2	A little chilly.  A little windy.  A lot better than playing in that heat.	681_2.a	2007-01-22	F	681	Vera Zvonareva	Maria Sharapova	What were the conditions like?  Seemed chilly.	681_2.q	2.0	1	4th Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
681_3	I don't know.  Let's go through the whole forecast.	681_3.a	2007-01-22	F	681	Vera Zvonareva	Maria Sharapova	Heat first, steam second, chilly now.  What's next?	681_3.q	2.0	1	4th Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
681_4	In a way, yeah.  In a way, I was out on the court a little bit longer.  But at that point I wasn't -- like I said, I don't think a lot had -- tennis-wise, it wasn't like I was working on some shots, something wasn't working.  It was just that basically I was just trying to beat the conditions out there. I mean, it's hard to say.  But, yeah, it definitely made me stronger.  As you look on, you think that you were a girl that was serving for the match, and now here you are in the quarters.  So, yeah, it's a pretty good stat.	681_4.a	2007-01-22	F	681	Vera Zvonareva	Maria Sharapova	Sometimes people think having a tough first-round match is a good thing, a wake-up call.  At this stage of the tournament, do you look back on that and think maybe it was a positive?	681_4.q	2.0	1	4th Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
681_5	No.  She's been playing great tennis.  She played against me really well in Hong Kong, won in Sydney.  I didn't play there.  So, yeah, I don't see why.  That's cool.	681_5.a	2007-01-22	F	681	Vera Zvonareva	Maria Sharapova	Were you surprised that Kim is the favorite as far as the bookmakers go?	681_5.q	2.0	1	4th Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
681_6	Yeah, it means that I showed some pretty decent results last year with the help of Justine's withdrawal here and Amlie losing the other day.  Yeah, it's a good fact, but it's not something I go onto the court thinking about. Probably at the end of the tournament, once you see it on paper again, it's pretty cool.  Yeah, it takes you back to the hard work and the results that you've had.	681_6.a	2007-01-22	F	681	Vera Zvonareva	Maria Sharapova	What does No.1 mean to you?  You're going to reclaim that when the tournament is done.	681_6.q	2.0	1	4th Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
681_7	I mean, I don't know.  I didn't really -- no one really told me, You're going to be No.1.  When I was No.2 in the world, Justine obviously was No.1, she lost in the final last year, so it's not a lot of points.  You automatically do some math in your head.  It's not that big of a deal.	681_7.a	2007-01-22	F	681	Vera Zvonareva	Maria Sharapova	When did you actually hear about it?	681_7.q	2.0	1	4th Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
681_8	Yeah, I do.  I do.  I felt like it was going to be tough.  I challenged myself.  I wanted to see what I could come up with today because I felt like I needed to come up with something better than I did in my previous rounds.  It was good to go out there and just finish the match.  I was definitely lucky to get out of it the way that I did. But, yeah, looking back, I think I was very pleased with the way things went.	681_8.a	2007-01-22	F	681	Vera Zvonareva	Maria Sharapova	Do you like the kind of match against Vera when you know you're going to have to run and play some defense?	681_8.q	2.0	1	4th Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
681_9	Yeah, yeah.  Probably some of the longest rallies I've had this week.  Tougher situations point-wise, holding your serve, again being breakpoints down.	681_9.a	2007-01-22	F	681	Vera Zvonareva	Maria Sharapova	Movement-wise, seemed to be as well as you've run all tournament.	681_9.q	2.0	1	4th Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
681_10	No.  Just the one against Serena, I mean, that was years ago.  You don't think about that when you're on court.  I forgot that a couple days after that happened.  Those don't affect me that much.	681_10.a	2007-01-22	F	681	Vera Zvonareva	Maria Sharapova	You've had some pretty tough losses here the last couple years.  Is that any extra motivation or incentive for you?	681_10.q	2.0	1	4th Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
681_11	I don't think I played that bad.  I did, I made a pretty easy error.  I should have hit a volley when the whole court was open.  I decided to hit a swing volley at 30-15. From that point on, I didn't think that I really just gave it to her.  I mean, she worked hard for that game.  She earned it.  It was a little bit of up and down from that 5-2. I mean, look, I was down Love-40 on my serves and I think I hit like three or four backhand winners.  I can say that I'm pretty proud that I could come up with that in that sort of situation, because that's basically what it's all about.	681_11.a	2007-01-22	F	681	Vera Zvonareva	Maria Sharapova	No breakpoints until you were serving for the match.  But what happened there?	681_11.q	2.0	1	4th Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
681_12	Little bits here and there.  I think she's more of a developed player than she was then.  She's definitely a lot more experienced.  She's played more top players, has had great wins over top players. I mean, look, I don't think I'm going to look back at that match too much.  Obviously I've seen her play here and there.  Just got to go out, and if I play like I did today, I think my chances are pretty good.	681_12.a	2007-01-22	F	681	Vera Zvonareva	Maria Sharapova	Chakvetadze has been playing great.  Do you remember the L.A. match, 7-5 in the third?	681_12.q	2.0	1	4th Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
681_13	No, it's not really a relief.  It was that feeling inside of you where you know you're able to win another Grand Slam, you know you have it in you.  It was just like when are things going to come together physically, mentally, a little bit of luck here or there.  Fortunately it came out at the Open. But I think it was just more, you know, you guys, more the media just trying to sort of make a bigger deal out of it than it really was.  Technically I've always said I never really expected to win my first major at 17 years old.  After you win your first major, it's really understandable that a lot of people expect you to win another major really soon.	681_13.a	2007-01-22	F	681	Vera Zvonareva	Maria Sharapova	You've been in this stage of a Slam so many times in the last several years.  Getting over the hurdle of New York to get your second major, do you think that gives you a sense of relief going forward, that you got the second one in the bag?	681_13.q	2.0	1	4th Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
681_14	And I felt like I was learning with every match that I played in those situations.  I probably became stronger by losing to Justine those many times.  I learned more about my game.  I learned more about her strengths and my strengths through those matches.  Sometimes you've got to give up some to win maybe one or two.  There's always going to be a time to shine at some point.	681_14.a	2007-01-22	F	681	Vera Zvonareva	Maria Sharapova	You were knocking at the door at many tournaments.	681_14.q	2.0	1	4th Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
681_15	Yeah, definitely.	681_15.a	2007-01-22	F	681	Vera Zvonareva	Maria Sharapova	You're saying if you weren't ready to win Wimbledon 2004, you were probably ready to win the Open last year?	681_15.q	2.0	1	4th Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
681_16	Uhm, that's a good question.  I mean, my team asks me that all the time.  They even asked me after the Open.  I mean, You've won two majors.  You've been No.1.  You won The Championships. I mean, honestly, I still enjoy going out on court and working to be a better player.  I still feel like I can be so much better.  That's what sort of drives me, because if I add little things that can make me better, I think that I have many more Grand Slams in me. As long as I have that feeling inside of me, then I'm always going to go out and work on those things and have that competitive spirit in me.	681_16.a	2007-01-22	F	681	Vera Zvonareva	Maria Sharapova	Now going into this year, what do you think you're ready to do?	681_16.q	2.0	1	4th Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
681_17	I think positive of it.  I think a majority of the players, and the fans, enjoy it.  There are only a few cases, that, you know, that don't like it. It's one of those things, you know, it's there.  If you don't want to use it, you don't have to use it.  It's your choice.  But if there's a doubt in your mind, you want to challenge a call, why not?  It's there for you. It adds so much more excitement to the TV.  You know on a certain point that can bother so many players, if you really think that was a misjudgment by the umpire or the lines person, it's up to you to make that decision to challenge a call.  If you don't like it, don't do it.	681_17.a	2007-01-22	F	681	Vera Zvonareva	Maria Sharapova	What is your take on the Hawk-Eye system?	681_17.q	2.0	1	4th Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1313_0	Yeah, it's tough to know.  But, you know, I was definitely playing a little bit better in the first set than the rest of the match.  I had a lot of 30-All points where I didn't take my opportunities there.  I think it was about three or four games in a row I had 30-All on his serve.  Didn't get one breakpoint.  Disappointing.  Then also three set points, it makes it tough. But, yeah, a little bit disappointed with the way I played in the second and third.	1313_0.a	2008-01-15	M	1313	nan	Chris Guccione	Just looking on, it seemed that if things might have gone differently in that first-set tiebreak might have gone a bit differently for the rest of the match.	1313_0.q	91.0	0	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1313_1	No, not really.  I played the volley quite well.  It just clipped the tape, as you said.  You know, from there I was still well in the match.  It was only 6-All in the tiebreak, my serve.  You know, I was still feeling confident from there.	1313_1.a	2008-01-15	M	1313	nan	Chris Guccione	Did you have a feeling in your mind when the net cord bounced on your side of the net that that was a significant moment?	1313_1.q	91.0	0	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1313_2	I felt fine.  Yeah, I felt good.	1313_2.a	2008-01-15	M	1313	nan	Chris Guccione	How are you feeling physically today?	1313_2.q	91.0	0	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1313_3	Yeah, for sure.  You know, for me it's always going to be tough.  But, yeah, it's one thing we always work on, along with other things. But, you know, I mean, that's one of the main things we're focusing on at the moment.	1313_3.a	2008-01-15	M	1313	nan	Chris Guccione	Consistency in your game probably the next thing you have to improve on?	1313_3.q	91.0	0	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1313_4	Obviously pretty disappointed.  You know, it's a home Grand Slam.  You know, I've lost the first round the last few years now. You know, get ready for doubles this week and then get ready for the next round of tournaments over in the States.	1313_4.a	2008-01-15	M	1313	nan	Chris Guccione	After the great ride in Sydney, what is the overriding feeling now?	1313_4.q	91.0	0	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1313_5	Are you serious?  What do you think I'm doing?	1313_5.a	2008-01-15	M	1313	nan	Chris Guccione	Had you set yourself to go past that first round this time around?	1313_5.q	91.0	0	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1313_6	Of course I'm trying to get through the first round.  It's my first goal coming into a tournament.	1313_6.a	2008-01-15	M	1313	nan	Chris Guccione	Given the way Sydney went so well.	1313_6.q	91.0	0	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1313_7	No, it's not too hard at all.  I mean, coming off a good week it's easy to get up for a Grand Slam especially.  It felt physically fine, mentally felt good.  Just didn't execute the game plan today.	1313_7.a	2008-01-15	M	1313	nan	Chris Guccione	Some people might think after the emotions last week you might be feeling a bit flat.  You said physically you feel fine.  How was it emotionally trying to lift yourself again this week?	1313_7.q	91.0	0	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1313_8	Yeah, you know, I lost my first service game in the second and third set, which is -- - you know, one thing that I try to focus on is to try to get off to good starts in sets. I missed a couple volleys early in the second.  Yeah, as you said, he did get a bit of a read on my serve.  He was standing quite far back, so it gives him a lot more time to hit the return.  He returned well today.	1313_8.a	2008-01-15	M	1313	nan	Chris Guccione	As the match wore on, your first two service games went to love, he seemed to get an increasingly better read on your serve.  In the second set you served over 80%, but he still broke you.	1313_8.q	91.0	0	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1313_9	My serve's a big part of my game.  But, you know, I think I'm -- especially in Sydney I was winning a decent percentage on second serves and obviously breaking the guys in the second and third rounds.  You know, I mean, it's tough to know.  But, I mean, hopefully I'll serve well a lot of the matches I'll play.	1313_9.a	2008-01-15	M	1313	nan	Chris Guccione	Is it a fair criticism that if your serve gets tamed there's not enough there for you to fall back upon at this level?	1313_9.q	91.0	0	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1313_10	Yeah, they were great.  Last couple years I've played on Vodafone.  You know, come out to Margaret Court, the crowd support was amazing.  All the chanting and cheering, it was a great atmosphere.	1313_10.a	2008-01-15	M	1313	nan	Chris Guccione	It looked as though the crowd was doing everything humanly possible, aside from jumping out there to pick up a racquet.  Pretty amazing.	1313_10.q	91.0	0	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1313_11	Always nervous going into matches, especially here at the Australian Open, being hometown. But, you know, nerves sort of go away after the first few games.  Once you get into the match you stop thinking about it and you're just focusing on trying to beat your opponent. Yeah, I mean, definitely nerves before the match.  But, I mean, they went away after a while.	1313_11.a	2008-01-15	M	1313	nan	Chris Guccione	Coming into this game on such good form, did you feel more expectation, more nervous compared to past Australian Opens you've played in?	1313_11.q	91.0	0	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1313_12	No.  I mean, I think nerves are good.  They're a good part of the game.  They help you, I think.	1313_12.a	2008-01-15	M	1313	nan	Chris Guccione	Do you do anything to try to calm your nerves?	1313_12.q	91.0	0	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1313_13	Not really.  He's a very talented player.  He's good off both wings.  Yeah, I mean, after the first set he definitely picked up his return game, which I knew he could return well, and he wasn't in the first set. You know, I mean, full credit to him in the second and third sets to return the way he did.	1313_13.a	2008-01-15	M	1313	nan	Chris Guccione	Did Lee do some things that surprised you today that you didn't expect him to do as well on certain shots?  Was there something about his game that surprised you?	1313_13.q	91.0	0	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
894_0	Yeah, the wind was unbelievable.  On one side of the court, the ball, it was so difficult to serve.  The ball would just all of a sudden catch a whiff of wind and really be difficult to control. On the side where he was serving at 5-All, I was serving at 6-5 to close out the match, I tried to take my opportunity at 5-All in the third set because I knew it was really windy on that side.  You could tell by the shirts, by your shirt, just how windy it was.  I tried to take my opportunity to break.  I got a little lucky on one ball, lob over his head on the line, broke and then had to serve it out in the wind, which was pretty stressful, too (laughter).	894_0.a	2007-08-08	M	894	Wayne Odesnik	Frank Dancevic	How much of a factor was the wind out there today?	894_0.q	91.0	1	2nd Round	ROGERS MASTERS	Masters
894_1	He just gave me one more opportunity to hit a ball.  He hit a volley up high at the net.  It was a little bit windy.  If it wasn't windy, it probably would have been a clean winner.  The ball was kind of waving through the air.  He gave me one more opportunity.  Somehow I got my racquet on it, got it over his head. Basically at that point of the match, 5-All in the third, breakpoint, I was just trying to make every ball in the court.	894_1.a	2007-08-08	M	894	Wayne Odesnik	Frank Dancevic	That shot in particular looked like you short-hopped it between your legs.  Could you ever imagine making a shot like that in that situation?	894_1.q	91.0	1	2nd Round	ROGERS MASTERS	Masters
894_2	Well, it was just really difficult to play on that side.  I knew how difficult it was for myself.  It was really difficult, the contrast.  On one side it was completely calm and on the other side you had all of a sudden this gust of wind on you.  It was a really hard north wind. I just knew, like shanking those balls, I knew when he went on the other side, it was going to be just as difficult for him to play on that side.	894_2.a	2007-08-08	M	894	Wayne Odesnik	Frank Dancevic	Once you had a few of the miss-hits with the wind, did that make you back off a little bit, feel your way through?	894_2.q	91.0	1	2nd Round	ROGERS MASTERS	Masters
894_3	I mean, absolutely.  I think every match I play in an environment like this, I played more stadium matches I think this year than regular matches.  I think in that environment, playing against top players week after week definitely helps out.	894_3.a	2007-08-08	M	894	Wayne Odesnik	Frank Dancevic	Do you feel yourself getting more comfortable in the environments like you were today?	894_3.q	91.0	1	2nd Round	ROGERS MASTERS	Masters
894_4	Absolutely.  Every win you gain confidence from.  Last week, like I said earlier, I wasn't really expecting -- I was hoping to get through my second-round match.  I got through and ended up running all the way to the final.  It was a little bit of a surprise to me.  I gained some confidence from it.  I tried to take it and use it for this week also.	894_4.a	2007-08-08	M	894	Wayne Odesnik	Frank Dancevic	As far as playing those top players, finding success, the confidence that must come from that.	894_4.q	91.0	1	2nd Round	ROGERS MASTERS	Masters
894_5	I think he has a little bit of a similar game style than Odesnik.  Maybe a little or aggressive, a little bit bigger serve.  Never played him before, so I'm not quite sure.  Maybe my coach watched him a little bit, know a little bit more tactically what to do.	894_5.a	2007-08-08	M	894	Wayne Odesnik	Frank Dancevic	What do you know about Verdasco?	894_5.q	91.0	1	2nd Round	ROGERS MASTERS	Masters
894_6	Yeah, I guess I feel a little lucky.  Anybody who's in the third round, who's beaten seeds, is playing just as well as a seed.  I think when it comes to these big tournaments, a guy who is 20 or 30 in the world can beat a guy eight in the world any day if they have a good day and the other guy is just a bit off. But we'll see.  I'm just trying to think about myself right now and trying to focus on what I have to do and serve well and return well and that's it.	894_6.a	2007-08-08	M	894	Wayne Odesnik	Frank Dancevic	You've had two seeds fall out in front of you.  Do you feel lucky?	894_6.q	91.0	1	2nd Round	ROGERS MASTERS	Masters
894_7	On the windy side?	894_7.a	2007-08-08	M	894	Wayne Odesnik	Frank Dancevic	Particularly on that one side, did you feel you were tempted when you made approach shots?	894_7.q	91.0	1	2nd Round	ROGERS MASTERS	Masters
894_8	I'm going to go work on that in practice.  I made a couple errors I didn't want to make on that side.  I think it was a little bit of footwork.  Just going to go out on the practice court and clean it up for my next match.	894_8.a	2007-08-08	M	894	Wayne Odesnik	Frank Dancevic	Yes.	894_8.q	91.0	1	2nd Round	ROGERS MASTERS	Masters
1277_0	Definitely got to hit a lot of balls.  She plays a really feisty game, brings a lot of balls back, and a lot of balls low.  And she was definitely on her best tennis today.  So she played well.	1277_0.a	2008-01-17	F	1277	nan	Venus Williams	Looked like a tough match on the score board.  How did you assess it?	1277_0.q	8.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1277_1	Yeah, I had a few.	1277_1.a	2008-01-17	F	1277	nan	Venus Williams	A few unforced errors?	1277_1.q	8.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1277_2	Because I guess I made some mistakes.	1277_2.a	2008-01-17	F	1277	nan	Venus Williams	Why was that?	1277_2.q	8.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1277_3	I mean, to be honest, at this point, I feel like I know how to play tennis.  And whether or not I have my best match or a match that's not so good for me is not something that worries me for the next round. So either way, it's just important for me to get to the next round.  I feel like I can always play better, even if I play well.	1277_3.a	2008-01-17	F	1277	nan	Venus Williams	Is that the sort of game you need to bring you to your top, progress further in the championship?	1277_3.q	8.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1277_4	Yeah, actually, I have.  A little while ago.  She's a good player, also.  She tries to play aggressive.  Looks like she enjoys herself out there.	1277_4.a	2008-01-17	F	1277	nan	Venus Williams	You play Mirza in the next round.  What you do you know of her?  Have you played her before?	1277_4.q	8.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1277_5	No, not really.  Like I said earlier, nothing worries me anymore.  I feel like I know how to play.  If I make a few mistakes, I'm not going to freak out. I'm fine.  I feel good.	1277_5.a	2008-01-17	F	1277	nan	Venus Williams	Venus, there was a lot of breaks of serve in the match.  Were you concerned about your serving?	1277_5.q	8.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1277_6	Yeah, she definitely played well.  And at first, I think I wanted to rush a little bit too much.  But finally, later in the second set, I finally realized, Whoa, she wants to run.  Well, let her run.  So it became a side-to-side kind of thing, I finally got a little smarter in the last few games, I felt. So all in all, it was fine.	1277_6.a	2008-01-17	F	1277	nan	Venus Williams	That kind of match is a good test for you, don't you think, because she makes you play a lot of different shots, you use different parts of your arsenal?	1277_6.q	8.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1277_7	Yeah, definitely, because I don't like practicing my volley.  I never did.  Of course, you don't want to come to the net if you don't.  Practicing volleys is kind of boring. So last time in the off-season, the first thing I did is I practiced volleys, no excuses.  So now I come in more because feel like volleying because I practiced it. I definitely will be at the net a lot more this year.	1277_7.a	2008-01-17	F	1277	nan	Venus Williams	You've been coming in a lot, which happened last couple years.  Looks like you're much more comfortable at net than you were, say, a decade ago?	1277_7.q	8.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1277_8	Yeah, definitely.  Even for us, like when I'm warming Serena up, I'm trying to hit soft, it's hard because I don't know how to do that.  I'm always saying, Softer, softer.  And they are missing because they don't know how to hit the soft ball, which is a different kind of ball.  If it's soft and low, then you have to adjust.  And just because it's slower doesn't necessarily mean it's easier.	1277_8.a	2008-01-17	F	1277	nan	Venus Williams	Practicing against hard hitters all the time when you play.  Against Camille, she has a soft serve.  Must be hard to get used to that.	1277_8.q	8.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1277_9	Yeah, I think she'll challenge anyone that she plays.  You definitely have to beat her.  She brings the ball back no matter.  You have to hit that winning shot.  And she can pressure you into hitting it a little too close to the line.	1277_9.a	2008-01-17	F	1277	nan	Venus Williams	She gave Sharapova a hard time last year.  I don't know if you saw that match.  Why does she give people a difficult time?	1277_9.q	8.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1277_10	Yeah, I don't talk about that very much.  I try to let it be the past.	1277_10.a	2008-01-17	F	1277	nan	Venus Williams	I don't know if you talked about this on Day 1, but can you talk about what happened towards the end of last year when you were forced to pull out of The Championships and you were get getting those dizzy spells.  What did the doctors actually say?	1277_10.q	8.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1277_11	I hope to God not.	1277_11.a	2008-01-17	F	1277	nan	Venus Williams	But is it something that is going to continue to affect you, or was it just a one off or...	1277_11.q	8.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1277_12	Yeah, I don't really like to talk about it, to be honest.  I just -- yeah, that's all I have to say.	1277_12.a	2008-01-17	F	1277	nan	Venus Williams	You don't want to say directly?  Because there was some reports out there that it might have been anemia.	1277_12.q	8.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1277_13	He's great.  We're all jokesters.  We all laugh and joke.  We all, you know, make fun of ourselves.  So he fits right in.  He works extremely hard.  I think he really cares about Serena and I.  I think he loves tennis.  And right now he has, like, really great hair.  So Serena and I were both very upset.  It was funny, because as soon as I got here to Melbourne, I was like, Your hair is great; I hate it.  Serena said, I said the same thing. It's funny.  We have a lot of fun with him.	1277_13.a	2008-01-17	F	1277	nan	Venus Williams	Venus, I'm doing a little feature on Mark Hlawaty.  Can you express a couple of words on what he means and how he fits in?	1277_13.q	8.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1277_14	We don't know why it's happened.  He let it grow out.  He said it grew like that.  We said, Are you serious?  It's not fair.  It's the perfect color, the perfect cut.  This can't be right. But, you know, it's good fun.	1277_14.a	2008-01-17	F	1277	nan	Venus Williams	What's making his hair great?	1277_14.q	8.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1277_15	He's great.  He brings a lot of balls back.  He can adjust his game, depending on who we're playing.  And he really is, you know, on our side.  No matter I think who he is with, I think he works hard for.	1277_15.a	2008-01-17	F	1277	nan	Venus Williams	Fashion things aside, he's pretty handy as a hitting partner, as well.  How important is he to you girls?	1277_15.q	8.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1277_16	I read that book.  My dad told me to read it.  And I think he told her to read it, too.  And I read it like around '05 Wimbledon, and I was, like, praying for some inspiration.  So then I read the book.  And I was, like, Okay, God answered my prayers. Whatever you can be inspired from, I feel I can learn from anything.  I haven't read it in a couple years.  She keeps quoting it.	1277_16.a	2008-01-17	F	1277	nan	Venus Williams	Venus, I saw your sister's blog yesterday and she said she read 'Who Moved My Cheese'. Do you read books like that or did she try to get you to read it?	1277_16.q	8.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1277_17	A little bit.  Maybe a little bit, especially since I didn't get to play last year.  So definitely a little bit.  But, I mean, I definitely have the ability to win.  That's the good part.  So I feel positive in that way.	1277_17.a	2008-01-17	F	1277	nan	Venus Williams	There aren't too many big hard court titles that have eluded you in your career, if any.  Do you bring that kind of awareness into a tournament like this?	1277_17.q	8.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1277_18	Well, I think Serena is the Williams sisters that is famous for her derrire.  She makes all kinds of songs, Kanye West and Snoop Dog, all kinds of things.  She's renowned.  So I guess I'm getting a one-up on her, maybe.  (laughter.)	1277_18.a	2008-01-17	F	1277	nan	Venus Williams	How do you feel about television commentators making comments about your rear-end?  I mean, not in a negative way.	1277_18.q	8.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1277_19	We're very serious about the doubles.  We love doubles.  Recent years we haven't been lucky, so we're like, Okay, let's get through the singles.  But we love playing with each other.  Nothing like playing with Serena.  It's like playing with myself.  So it's amazing. And we love winning the titles.  I mean, when we were playing doubles, we were racking them up.  Grand Slam titles are wonderful things to have.  We hope we get to play more.  We definitely are going to try to play a lot this year.	1277_19.a	2008-01-17	F	1277	nan	Venus Williams	You have a doubles match coming up in a little while.  How important is that in the scheme of things?  Are you trying to win in the doubles?	1277_19.q	8.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1277_20	It's a little bit hard.  No one lives where I live, so in that way it's a little bit challenging because everyone goes home after the tennis, you know. So I'm definitely friendly with a lot of girls, but it's not like we live in the same area, and that makes it challenging.	1277_20.a	2008-01-17	F	1277	nan	Venus Williams	When you came on the circuit a decade ago, you were only surrounded by your family, your sister.  You didn't have too many friends in the circuit.  How this has changed in the last 10 years?  Do you have other people you like to see outside of the tennis court, even if they are tennis players, or you never see them?	1277_20.q	8.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1277_21	Yeah, definitely.  The girls are really nice.  Everyone's nice.  I haven't met one, you know, person that was mean or that, you know, totally gave me the evil eye or something. Everybody's, you know, happy in the locker room.  I mean, you lose, not so happy, but everyone gets along.	1277_21.a	2008-01-17	F	1277	nan	Venus Williams	In the locker rooms, they're more friendly or let's say people you have lunch together here if you have a chance or not?	1277_21.q	8.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3787_0	Confidence has a lot to do with it. Belief. And then I'm playing a lot better than I did before.	3787_0.a	2011-08-19	M	3787	Rafael Nadal	Mardy Fish	How were you able to succeed today where you had fallen short six previous times?	3787_0.q	7.0	1	Quarterfinals	WESTERN & SOUTHERN OPEN	Masters 1000
3787_1	I heard that. Thanks for the jinx.	3787_1.a	2011-08-19	M	3787	Rafael Nadal	Mardy Fish	You've now held serve 29 games.	3787_1.q	7.0	1	Quarterfinals	WESTERN & SOUTHERN OPEN	Masters 1000
3787_2	Taking advantage of the opportunities, making a lot first serves in key moments, not giving away many free points. Look, those three guys return extremely well, you know, so if I don't lose serve, I am usually pretty successful. You know, I usually won't play a 7-6 in the third tight match if I don't lose serve, so -- unless I'm playing Isner.	3787_2.a	2011-08-19	M	3787	Rafael Nadal	Mardy Fish	That sounds remarkable to us, but how do you frame it?	3787_2.q	7.0	1	Quarterfinals	WESTERN & SOUTHERN OPEN	Masters 1000
3787_3	I mean, do you have any regrets at all?	3787_3.a	2011-08-19	M	3787	Rafael Nadal	Mardy Fish	Given how well you've been playing the last year and a half, do you have any regrets or wonder what might have been had you been able to make the same level of commitment eight years ago?	3787_3.q	7.0	1	Quarterfinals	WESTERN & SOUTHERN OPEN	Masters 1000
3787_4	Yeah, of course. I'm a human being so I have regrets. Certainly not figuring it out earlier, but I didn't. You know, I certainly don't lose sleep over it, but, yeah, I regret not being able to mature quicker than a lot of other people. But I didn't.	3787_4.a	2011-08-19	M	3787	Rafael Nadal	Mardy Fish	Sure.	3787_4.q	7.0	1	Quarterfinals	WESTERN & SOUTHERN OPEN	Masters 1000
3787_5	I don't think I'll feel 19 tomorrow morning when I wake up, but, look, you only get better. You only get more and more experience, in my opinion.	3787_5.a	2011-08-19	M	3787	Rafael Nadal	Mardy Fish	Is 29 the new 19?	3787_5.q	7.0	1	Quarterfinals	WESTERN & SOUTHERN OPEN	Masters 1000
3787_6	I'll try. The difference, what I felt, was I played him at Wimbledon. I served the opening game. I lost serve in 45 seconds at 15, and wasn't unbelievably surprised. You know, I was like, Oh, not a good start kind of thing. I was down 15-40 here and I felt like I left maybe one or two points out there in those four points. I felt like I wanted a better start than Wimbledon. It's just that small belief that I really felt like I could win. Not that I wanted to win, I really felt like I could and maybe should win in that scenario. That's best that I can do.	3787_6.a	2011-08-19	M	3787	Rafael Nadal	Mardy Fish	Can you describe the difference between thinking you can win and knowing you can?	3787_6.q	7.0	1	Quarterfinals	WESTERN & SOUTHERN OPEN	Masters 1000
3787_7	Helps that I played a lot of big matches in the past couple weeks. If I had just been in that situation, you know, if that would have been the first time, I would have been really nervous. I played a couple nervous points, but I was pretty happy with the way I executed. That first point or two in the last game was huge. I got a little lucky. I hit the top of the tape and maybe the side of the line on a defensive forehand crosscourt and maybe caught him off guard and he missed his slice out wide. A little bit of luck and a little bit of belief as well.	3787_7.a	2011-08-19	M	3787	Rafael Nadal	Mardy Fish	When you broke at 3-2 in the second, what do you tell yourself to not get too far ahead of yourself given the magnitude of the situation, a possible first win against Nadal?	3787_7.q	7.0	1	Quarterfinals	WESTERN & SOUTHERN OPEN	Masters 1000
3787_8	It was a hug thing. Supposed to be a hug. Something that I've done. I saw Jonas Bjorkman do it at Wimbledon a long time ago, and I thought that that was a pretty special moment for him. I clearly copied off him. I've done it here a few times. I had unbelievable crowd support, and I felt it and I wanted to show it.	3787_8.a	2011-08-19	M	3787	Rafael Nadal	Mardy Fish	What message were you trying to send to the crowd with your gesture afterward?	3787_8.q	7.0	1	Quarterfinals	WESTERN & SOUTHERN OPEN	Masters 1000
3787_9	Yeah, probably. Probably. You know, he's a big, huge hurdle. He's going to go down as one of the best players ever, and it would be pretty cool to tell my kids one day that I beat Rafael Nadal. I beat Roger Federer as well in Indian Wells. And it's just not the first round of an event either. It was a big match for both of us. Bunch of Davis Cup wins too that will probably be higher. But it's up there (smiling.)	3787_9.a	2011-08-19	M	3787	Rafael Nadal	Mardy Fish	Where does this win rank for you? Top 5?	3787_9.q	7.0	1	Quarterfinals	WESTERN & SOUTHERN OPEN	Masters 1000
3787_10	I didn't necessarily feel that I served at a low percentage. I served very well when I needed to. If you look at maybe the big points or the most important points, what percentage I served at there, I bet it was pretty high. So I don't necessarily look at that and say that I served poorly. I served very well at key moments.	3787_10.a	2011-08-19	M	3787	Rafael Nadal	Mardy Fish	First serve percentage was 53%. Is that something you're going to have to improve to beat Murray tomorrow?	3787_10.q	7.0	1	Quarterfinals	WESTERN & SOUTHERN OPEN	Masters 1000
3787_11	Ah, just means I'm a better player than I've been. I think Wimbledon was the first time I had played him since my knee surgery, so it's a little different look for him as well. I'm a different player.	3787_11.a	2011-08-19	M	3787	Rafael Nadal	Mardy Fish	Does the timing of this win change a little bit now that you've been in the top 10 for a little while and finally got the big win?	3787_11.q	7.0	1	Quarterfinals	WESTERN & SOUTHERN OPEN	Masters 1000
3787_12	Yeah, and I would like to stay in the top 10 for a long time. I'll ride it as long as I can. But I didn't have that one big win since I've been there. My last big win was probably, you know, maybe Murray here last year. That was my last I think top 5 win. So it would been a while to beat really a top player. I played a great match against Berdych at Wimbledon as well in the fourth round. This one is bigger than that.	3787_12.a	2011-08-19	M	3787	Rafael Nadal	Mardy Fish	You said on the television interview that you felt the win cemented your position in the top 10. Did you feel a little bit that some people look at it and say, Oh, he's had a good run rather than taking you as a top-10 player?	3787_12.q	7.0	1	Quarterfinals	WESTERN & SOUTHERN OPEN	Masters 1000
3787_13	It helps to take advantage of your opportunities, play well on the surfaces that you're comfortable on and that suit your game best. You know, I'm not going to pick up a thousand points in the clay court season. Pretty well aware of that. So I've got to take advantage of tournaments like Wimbledon, like a court in Montral last week, and a court here and a court at the Open. Those are all great opportunities for me wherever I'm ranked. You know, London is the goal for sure for me. Just to get there one time would be very special.	3787_13.a	2011-08-19	M	3787	Rafael Nadal	Mardy Fish	You're at a career high 7 this week. What do you think the key is to be able to stay consistent, to stay in the top 10 for the rest of year and also years to come?	3787_13.q	7.0	1	Quarterfinals	WESTERN & SOUTHERN OPEN	Masters 1000
3787_14	Yeah.	3787_14.a	2011-08-19	M	3787	Rafael Nadal	Mardy Fish	You're a real fan favorite here now. Is that something you're aware of during a match like this?	3787_14.q	7.0	1	Quarterfinals	WESTERN & SOUTHERN OPEN	Masters 1000
3787_15	No, I can feel it. That's what we talked about before, just showing my appreciation. This is a very special place for me. I've played very well and had great memories over the years. I'll never forget the crowd support last year in the final against Roger. They respect what he's done and does on the court for sure, but I felt like they wanted me to win. And I felt like it was the same today.	3787_15.a	2011-08-19	M	3787	Rafael Nadal	Mardy Fish	Or you're so focused that it's not...	3787_15.q	7.0	1	Quarterfinals	WESTERN & SOUTHERN OPEN	Masters 1000
3787_16	Means a ton. Yeah, feels like a tournament win really. I think it's the epitome of what the US Open Series is, and that it's not just coming over and playing two events and the US Open. It's grinding it out all summer and playing well throughout the summer. Whoever wins here or if Novak wins here, I think it's 100 points and 100 points for him. I still got a nice cushion, even if I lose tomorrow and he wins the tournament. So it doesn't necessarily feel like a fluke. I've played well. It's an honor.	3787_16.a	2011-08-19	M	3787	Rafael Nadal	Mardy Fish	Talk about the US Open Series win that you just completed. What does it mean to you?	3787_16.q	7.0	1	Quarterfinals	WESTERN & SOUTHERN OPEN	Masters 1000
3787_17	Not really more than normal. I have to -- you know, you got to get up on a guy like that. But you have to ask him that. I don't know how he felt. I'm sure he didn't feel great this morning, especially going out and playing doubles last night. I was pretty surprised by that. So, yeah, it was a good opportunity for me, I mean, to catch him on a place where maybe he's not as confident as previous matches or tournaments. You know, he lost in his first match last week, so it was just a great opportunity. Glad I took advantage.	3787_17.a	2011-08-19	M	3787	Rafael Nadal	Mardy Fish	How does Rafa's day yesterday factor into today? Did you want to win the first set more than normal?	3787_17.q	7.0	1	Quarterfinals	WESTERN & SOUTHERN OPEN	Masters 1000
3787_18	It helps to put yourself in these positions a lot. I feel like -- you know, I still have a long way to go. Murray and probably Djokovic or Federer, everyone is in the top 10 that's left. So it's a long ways to go. I feel like I have as good a chance as anyone.	3787_18.a	2011-08-19	M	3787	Rafael Nadal	Mardy Fish	You've made it to the final four in Masters events several times before in your career, but have yet to win one. Is there anything different you have to do to break through, and what would breaking through mean?	3787_18.q	7.0	1	Quarterfinals	WESTERN & SOUTHERN OPEN	Masters 1000
3787_19	Yeah, got to be aggressive. I have to take the patterns, try to get to the patterns that help me the most: crosscourt forehand; my crosscourt to his backhand was the best pattern of mine that I felt was going to be the most successful. So I tried that. He tried to get out of it as well. I felt that. The game in the second set I no longer found myself in those rallies. Credit to him for trying to change things up.	3787_19.a	2011-08-19	M	3787	Rafael Nadal	Mardy Fish	You talked about being able to play better on your serve like in key moments. Was that the key moment to beating Nadal? You won 73% of your service points coming into the game.	3787_19.q	7.0	1	Quarterfinals	WESTERN & SOUTHERN OPEN	Masters 1000
4581_0	Well, I was okay, but otherwise the grass was a little bit humid so it was dangerous little bit. But I was ready to play and to continue because I knew that I have a chance. So that's why.	4581_0.a	2012-07-02	F	4581	Francesca Schiavone	Petra Kvitova	What were the discussions about? You had two long breaks. Did you want to carry on?	4581_0.q	4.0	1	4th Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4581_1	No, not really. For her was tougher than for me because, you know, she need to moving more than me. On the otherwise, if I am playing really fast it's sliding on the grass, so it's more quicker than normally. But on the other, if she has a good slice it's sliding on my side, too, so it was... Yeah.	4581_1.a	2012-07-02	F	4581	Francesca Schiavone	Petra Kvitova	Were you surprised when she started moaning?	4581_1.q	4.0	1	4th Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4581_2	Yes. I said already I wanted to play.	4581_2.a	2012-07-02	F	4581	Francesca Schiavone	Petra Kvitova	When the umpire asked if you wanted to carry on, you said yes?	4581_2.q	4.0	1	4th Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4581_3	After the second set I felt more better than before, and I knew that I am in the good shape and I have good chances to have the second set. Yeah, it was a little bit about the break. But, anyway, it's help to me.	4581_3.a	2012-07-02	F	4581	Francesca Schiavone	Petra Kvitova	You seemed to be a bit grumpy with the weather or yourself and after stormed to victory.	4581_3.q	4.0	1	4th Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4581_4	Yeah, it's could be. I think that she didn't want to play really on the little bit wet grass. Yeah, maybe she lost little bit on the concentration. But I'm not sure it was really the big key of the match.	4581_4.a	2012-07-02	F	4581	Francesca Schiavone	Petra Kvitova	Do you feel your opponent lost concentration because of the break and the worry about the weather?	4581_4.q	4.0	1	4th Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4581_5	Yeah, I think, you know, from the beginning of the match I didn't had a lot of break ball and I didn't have a very nice feelings. I mean, really it was not funny for me in that moment. I feel so bad. That's why probably I played so bad. And then in the second set, in the beginning of the second set was still similar than before, but when I make the break finally after one hour or however long we played, it was better for me. I knew I can play against her and I can break her.	4581_5.a	2012-07-02	F	4581	Francesca Schiavone	Petra Kvitova	Talk about the first two sets, what a big fight and struggle it was. She seemed to be playing at a high level and you were looking for your game a lot.	4581_5.q	4.0	1	4th Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4581_6	Yeah, I think so. I hope so. Every match is different. The last matches I played so well and so quick, and today it's about the fight. I'm so happy that I showed that. It's important. Tomorrow is different day, so I hope they will be better tomorrow.	4581_6.a	2012-07-02	F	4581	Francesca Schiavone	Petra Kvitova	I guess the positive when you're struggling is if you win a match like that when you're not playing well, it shows that you're still fighting and able to focus, huh?	4581_6.q	4.0	1	4th Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4581_7	Well, I mean, now for me it's much better than on the beginning of the tournament, so I'm glad that I'm continuing in the tournament. I'm not thinking about the pressure. I mean, every match what I played I was favorite. But, yeah, I do not thinking about the pressure too much.	4581_7.a	2012-07-02	F	4581	Francesca Schiavone	Petra Kvitova	As we get later in the tournament the pressure increases. What is your personal approach to pressure?	4581_7.q	4.0	1	4th Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4581_8	I think it will be huge match for both of us, and I'm looking forward to play against her. Looking forward to have a challenge. I mean, she played well. She has a great champion. She won many times here. We will see. I will try my best and we will see.	4581_8.a	2012-07-02	F	4581	Francesca Schiavone	Petra Kvitova	What are your thoughts on facing Serena Williams?	4581_8.q	4.0	1	4th Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4581_9	Yeah, I did, in a semifinal here. For me it was a big experiences. I will try to have a match on my side tomorrow.	4581_9.a	2012-07-02	F	4581	Francesca Schiavone	Petra Kvitova	Any other specifics tactically what it is to face her? You did play her two years ago.	4581_9.q	4.0	1	4th Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4581_10	Yeah, maybe a little bit because it was cold on the court. It wasn't easy to have still a warm body and warm muscles. Then if you are standing you have to move a little bit more and try to have a little bit warm muscles.	4581_10.a	2012-07-02	F	4581	Francesca Schiavone	Petra Kvitova	When you're sitting there on the chair under the umbrella for five minutes, does that create a problem with muscles getting tense and cold?	4581_10.q	4.0	1	4th Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4581_11	It depends. I don't care about the quick decision. But, anyway, I mean, if she said that we can wait on the chair just little bit, just few minutes, we are okay. So it's better to stay there than go to locker room and come back.	4581_11.a	2012-07-02	F	4581	Francesca Schiavone	Petra Kvitova	It was important for the umpire to make a quick decision? So either play or go off. Do you need a quick decision?	4581_11.q	4.0	1	4th Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4581_12	Yes.	4581_12.a	2012-07-02	F	4581	Francesca Schiavone	Petra Kvitova	The first time you played Serena in Australia, do you remember that match?	4581_12.q	4.0	1	4th Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4581_13	The first match?	4581_13.a	2012-07-02	F	4581	Francesca Schiavone	Petra Kvitova	I won't talk about the score. At that point you were maybe too immature and she was such a big player that you couldn't really find your game. Di you think of her as someone way up there and you weren't ready to play her?	4581_13.q	4.0	1	4th Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4581_14	Yeah, I remember very well. I was little bit injured before the Australian Open. When I face her in the second round, yeah, I knew that she's tough opponent. But I think I won like two or three games. She played so well. I didn't play badly. But, anyway, I didn't have a chance.	4581_14.a	2012-07-02	F	4581	Francesca Schiavone	Petra Kvitova	Yes.	4581_14.q	4.0	1	4th Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4581_15	Yeah, I hope so. I think that from the time I improve my game. She's playing still very well, but, I mean, not as well as in the Australian Open. I think that she won the Grand Slam after. So, yeah, I think it will be a really different match to compare the years ago.	4581_15.a	2012-07-02	F	4581	Francesca Schiavone	Petra Kvitova	So now I'm assuming you're at the level, defending champion, you have a different feeling when you're facing someone like her?	4581_15.q	4.0	1	4th Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4581_16	I'm not sure. I'm not thinking about the pressure. Yeah, I'm defending champion, but it was last year what I won here. I will try to play my best in the second week, too. It's the match tomorrow, so I will focus on this match.	4581_16.a	2012-07-02	F	4581	Francesca Schiavone	Petra Kvitova	Do you think being the defending champion helps you to embrace the pressure that's coming on now in the second week?	4581_16.q	4.0	1	4th Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4581_17	I think that without pressure it's boring. I mean, if you are playing very well you need the pressure, because otherwise you are not playing well and you didn't have some good results. So, I mean, that's about the pressure.	4581_17.a	2012-07-02	F	4581	Francesca Schiavone	Petra Kvitova	What's the best thing about pressure and what's the worst thing about it?	4581_17.q	4.0	1	4th Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4581_18	Actually, I was focusing on my match. I think Maria didn't play so well in this tournament from the beginning. I read that she knew it, that she needs to improve her game. I think Lisicki has a big serve. It's tough to return and break her. Yeah, I'm not really surprised about the score, but I thought it could be like three sets. About Kerber, that was really surprise for me to have this score for her.	4581_18.a	2012-07-02	F	4581	Francesca Schiavone	Petra Kvitova	A lot of people were very surprised when Rosol beat Nadal like he did. Today Kerber beat Kim very easily and Lisicki beat Sharapova. Did those two women's results surprise you?	4581_18.q	4.0	1	4th Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3352_0	Um, well, most of it was not great today. I didn't serve particularly well. I didn't move very well, which is normally something that, you know, early on in tournaments when you're not hitting the ball well, you know, running a lot of balls down and making your opponent play can sometimes get the job done. But I didn't move particularly well, and, you know, he hit a lot of winners. He gained in confidence I guess from hitting more winners.	3352_0.a	2011-03-12	M	3352	Donald Young	Andy Murray	What would you say is wrong with your game right now?	3352_0.q	5.0	0	2nd Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
3352_1	No, I think I was just pretty -- I didn't -- you know, the stuff I have been working on, I didn't really do a whole lot of it out there, and that's kind of what's disappointing. Because, you know, I'd like to be able to say that was the case, but it wasn't at all.	3352_1.a	2011-03-12	M	3352	Donald Young	Andy Murray	You did say that you were in a sort of an experimentation mode. Was it tough out there just to decide exactly how you wanted to play and what you wanted to do?	3352_1.q	5.0	0	2nd Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
3352_2	I don't know. I mean, I started the match well, and then, you know, when it got close to the end of the first set, I just didn't -- I didn't do anything particularly well. I didn't, you know, do anything to really make I guess lift myself. You know, kind of the crowd were, you know, for him. He started playing better. I didn't find my way back into the match.	3352_2.a	2011-03-12	M	3352	Donald Young	Andy Murray	Why was that?	3352_2.q	5.0	0	2nd Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
3352_3	No, the knee is okay. I mean, you get it all the time, especially when you haven't played matches for a while, slight pain, but it's not anything serious.	3352_3.a	2011-03-12	M	3352	Donald Young	Andy Murray	A little bit of trouble with the knee? Was there any...	3352_3.q	5.0	0	2nd Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
3352_4	I didn't understand the start of the question.	3352_4.a	2011-03-12	M	3352	Donald Young	Andy Murray	You're playing on a different continent. Do you think it's not something of surviving your first match, but playing another tournament on a different continent?	3352_4.q	5.0	0	2nd Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
3352_5	Yeah, that's what's important normally. Yeah, you try to find the way to get through it, and I didn't do that today. But that is normally the most important thing. You try and get through any way you can.	3352_5.a	2011-03-12	M	3352	Donald Young	Andy Murray	Well, it is your first tournament here in the U.S. now and the circumstances are different. Don't you think it's your first match then that's something of survival, just getting through that first match?	3352_5.q	5.0	0	2nd Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
3352_6	I think he's good. But, yeah, I don't know exactly how good. I think, you know, the toughest thing in the men's game has been - for guys to breakthrough - has been the consistency. Someone like Ryan has shown that he's done five, six, good tournaments in a row, and that's what you need to do if you want to try to get close to the top of the game. That's Donald has to try and do.	3352_6.a	2011-03-12	M	3352	Donald Young	Andy Murray	What's your big-picture assessment of Young? Obviously he's had some troubles. This is a big win for him. What do you see for his future?	3352_6.q	5.0	0	2nd Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
3352_7	Not right now, no. I always look forward to playing doubles with Jamie, but right now I would rather still be playing in the singles, obviously. Jamie hurt his foot quite badly and wasn't able to practice today, so I'm hoping he's going to be okay for the doubles. But I have to wait and see.	3352_7.a	2011-03-12	M	3352	Donald Young	Andy Murray	You and Jamie had an exciting win in the doubles last night. Is that a bit of a silver lining that you look forward to?	3352_7.q	5.0	0	2nd Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
3352_8	That happens quite a lot. In Australia I played a few guys I never played before. It's not, like, no excuse. You have to just deal with it. Same for him as well. The conditions, again, they're the same for both of us. It's very lively, especially on that court. You know, quite tough to keep the ball down. There's a lot of mistakes sort of long, and then, you know, then if you miss five or six long, then you get a wee bit tentative and you hit a few in the net. You need to make sure you keep going for your shots.	3352_8.a	2011-03-12	M	3352	Donald Young	Andy Murray	The conditions, were they difficult? Second part, how awkward was it playing somebody you hadn't played before?	3352_8.q	5.0	0	2nd Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
3352_9	I don't know. I finished what? 30 minutes ago? I haven't thought about it. I haven't been in that position for a while since I have been here. But I've got doubles, so, you know, I'll stay here until I'm done with doubles, and then I go on to Miami and hopefully have a better week there.	3352_9.a	2011-03-12	M	3352	Donald Young	Andy Murray	You have quite a gap before your next match. What are you going to do?	3352_9.q	5.0	0	2nd Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
3352_10	I have no idea. Robredo is a very, very tough player. I've played him quite a few times, and he's the sort of guy, you know, when he plays at a high level all the time, he makes a lot of balls, he's very fast, and that will be a tough match.	3352_10.a	2011-03-12	M	3352	Donald Young	Andy Murray	Do you think Donald Young will be successful in the next round?	3352_10.q	5.0	0	2nd Round	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Masters 1000
2942_0	It had nothing to do with that specific instance. First and foremost, let me say that Robin didn't hear the call because it was a very meek call; therefore you didn't challenge quickly. Completely understandable. So my only thing is he thought he won the point, went back to his towel, came back, and then we heard the score, and then there was a challenge. So my simple question was, how long -- I've seen umpires go, No, you took too long before, and they won't let 'em challenge. So all I wanted was a number on what's too long to challenge. They said, Timely manner. I said, What's a timely manner? Just it's at my judgment. Just give me a number. That's all I want is a number. You know, I ended up badgering him to where he said ten seconds, and then I just had another discussion with some other people from the ATP, and they said, Well, until the other guy serves. I said, Well that's like 22 seconds. So we're talking about a 12-second differential between know one knows. That's it. I mean, I'm not asking for like a miracle. I'm just asking for -- and someone else suggested that why don't the hawk eye people just start a thing and have a buzzer go off when you can't challenge anymore if someone is thinking about it. I don't think you should be able to look at marks and do the whole thing. We all do it; we're all guilty of it because we can, but I don't think we should be able to. That was my only thing, was that I couldn't get a flippin' answer on what's a timely manner. Just give me a definition of that. So we just talked each other in circles for an entire switchover.	2942_0.a	2010-08-19	M	2942	Robin Soderling	Andy Roddick	You had a couple of animated discussions with the chair umpire tonight. Was that about him not overruling when he should've?	2942_0.q	13.0	1	3rd Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP MASTERS	Masters 1000
2942_1	Sorry?	2942_1.a	2010-08-19	M	2942	Robin Soderling	Andy Roddick	Yesterday was solid; today was -- fill-in the blank.	2942_1.q	13.0	1	3rd Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP MASTERS	Masters 1000
2942_2	It was pretty good. Um, you know, most of it, the first set and a half was really, really good. Played a loose game there and then didn't play a great tiebreaker. Again, kept it together in the third and was able to get through. I thought I served pretty well and returned pretty well. I think each match is getting a little better.	2942_2.a	2010-08-19	M	2942	Robin Soderling	Andy Roddick	Yesterday was solid; today was?	2942_2.q	13.0	1	3rd Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP MASTERS	Masters 1000
2942_3	I don't know. I played pretty well yesterday. But I don't know. It's been a little while. I mean, it's been a struggle, so... To put three good matches together here was extremely necessary fore going into the US Open. If I had gone out first, second round here, that would not have been very good.	2942_3.a	2010-08-19	M	2942	Robin Soderling	Andy Roddick	When was the last time you would have felt as well about how you played as you did today?	2942_3.q	13.0	1	3rd Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP MASTERS	Masters 1000
2942_4	Yeah, well, they gave a not before 2:00. With the match at 7:00, not before 4:00 would have been super. Two hours doesn't make much sense, but it does in the grand scheme of it. So, yeah, especially with what I've been going through, I'm a little concern about it. You know, probably not thrilled. I certainly understand their position, though. They have to announce the lineup to the world, the global media, by a certain time. They can't wait on a result to dictate that. It's unfortunate, but I certainly understand their predicament as well.	2942_4.a	2010-08-19	M	2942	Robin Soderling	Andy Roddick	With respect to being on the sidelines for a little bit of an extended period of time, you had a night match tonight, and obviously a day match tomorrow. Any concerns about the quick turnaround time?	2942_4.q	13.0	1	3rd Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP MASTERS	Masters 1000
2942_5	It's good. Any time you beat a guy that's 5 in the world -- you know, beat a couple guys top 40 and then a guy 5 back-to-back-to-back, it's good thing. Especially a couple of tight ones. All three of them were pretty tight. That's what you're looking for. I came here with not a whole a lot of expectation. This probably exceeds what my confidence level was coming in. So I'm gonna leave this tournament, regardless of what happens, a lot more confident than I came. That's the first time I've been able to say that for a little bit.	2942_5.a	2010-08-19	M	2942	Robin Soderling	Andy Roddick	What does a match like this do for your confidence, not only for the rest of this tournament, but going into the US Open?	2942_5.q	13.0	1	3rd Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP MASTERS	Masters 1000
2942_6	Well he probably hits it harder. You know, he consistently probably hits it harder. It's a flatter serve, you know, therefore I think I have a little bit more movement on mine. Slice tailing away may be the other thing. But he serves big. There were a couple times there I think when I had match points I guessed the right way, you know, and still didn't get it. If he hits a spot at 137 going the other way, you know, he's dictating to you a lot of the time.	2942_6.a	2010-08-19	M	2942	Robin Soderling	Andy Roddick	Talk about Robin's serve. Obviously he serves as hard as you do. It didn't look like he was mixing it up maybe as much as you; is that a true assessment?	2942_6.q	13.0	1	3rd Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP MASTERS	Masters 1000
2942_7	Well, because it's normally a 50/50 proposition. The average first serve percentage on tour is what, 55? You know, that's basically -- here is the difference, okay.	2942_7.a	2010-08-19	M	2942	Robin Soderling	Andy Roddick	Sounds like a silly question, but you have a one-two combo with your first and second serve, maybe the best on tour, why do you and other guys take something off the second serve simply to get it in knowing that you've then reduced your chance of winning the point? We've actually crunched the numbers, and it actually comes out the other way sometimes.	2942_7.q	13.0	1	3rd Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP MASTERS	Masters 1000
2942_8	I understand that. I'm gonna explain it to you. Blackjack is what, about a 50/50 game? But you normally play until you go caput, correct? So all it takes is all of a sudden you're -- two double faults in a row and you're Love-30. If sports were played on a stat sheet, you know, the look of it would probably be a lot different. One thing you're not putting into consideration with the numbers is nervous tension. You know, it's a lot easier on a black and white piece of paper with a number to -- most people don't serve a ton better under pressure. So if you're digging yourself a hole, Love-15, Love-30, it's a totally different ballgame. That can't be explained numbers, I don't think.	2942_8.a	2010-08-19	M	2942	Robin Soderling	Andy Roddick	But you're winning 75% of those points.	2942_8.q	13.0	1	3rd Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP MASTERS	Masters 1000
2942_9	Yeah, we'll see. That's probably not -- I don't -- no disrespect, but I don't think I'm too concerned about. What I am concerned about is playing a guy who's been top 3 in the world for the past four years or so. That's what I'm concerned with. You know, he brings a lot to the table. He returns great and he's great off the ground and he's pretty solid and he toughs out a lot matches. It didn't get easier from here.	2942_9.a	2010-08-19	M	2942	Robin Soderling	Andy Roddick	Talk about your next match tomorrow against Djokovic. I think you're up in career head-to-heads. He's got some physical issues, respiratory, that might affect the match.	2942_9.q	13.0	1	3rd Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP MASTERS	Masters 1000
2942_10	Well, I mean, I would be guessing.	2942_10.a	2010-08-19	M	2942	Robin Soderling	Andy Roddick	I was thinking though that he'll be about as depleted as you are, so it might be more of an even match.	2942_10.q	13.0	1	3rd Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP MASTERS	Masters 1000
2942_11	I was disappointed that I didn't get a look at one second serve on those points. I think I put three out of four first serve returns in, you know. In the second set I feel like I didn't put returns in when I could have, in the tiebreaker especially. There I felt like I played a pretty good game through it all. He hit two aces and the first one he cracked a forehand winner at the first Love-40 point. What you want to do when someone makes a first serve is put the return in play and kind of see how it develops from there. I did that. So I was disappointed, but it was definitely a better-played game.	2942_11.a	2010-08-19	M	2942	Robin Soderling	Andy Roddick	Third set, Soderling serving at 3-4; he got into a Love-40 hole; he bounced back, got it to deuce, and then he had another breakpoint at that point, so four chances gone by the wayside. Didn't convert. But what was your thought process going into your service game at that point?	2942_11.q	13.0	1	3rd Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP MASTERS	Masters 1000
2942_12	It is taking the right points at the right time. You know what it is? It's putting yourself in good positions more often. In the second set breaker I played probably two or three loose points. There's your two points to the bad. I missed rally backhand. I don't think I put a first serve return in play. In the third set breaker I think I played pretty solid. Even the points I lost he was having to - what was it, at 4-5 or something like that we had an decent rally, and he crushed a forehand up the line for a winner. If he hits that, that's too good. But I played the right kind of point, and I think I did that more consistently in the third set breaker.	2942_12.a	2010-08-19	M	2942	Robin Soderling	Andy Roddick	So in this the end, such a small difference in the entire match. That third set tiebreak, is it really just luck, or is it you just taking the right points at the right time?	2942_12.q	13.0	1	3rd Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP MASTERS	Masters 1000
2942_13	Well, there's always stuff that I need to improve on. Probably not gonna advertise it.	2942_13.a	2010-08-19	M	2942	Robin Soderling	Andy Roddick	Is there anything that you're not happy about with the match tonight that you want to improve on you're your next match?	2942_13.q	13.0	1	3rd Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP MASTERS	Masters 1000
2942_14	Even in general I'm not gonna advertise it.	2942_14.a	2010-08-19	M	2942	Robin Soderling	Andy Roddick	Even in general?	2942_14.q	13.0	1	3rd Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP MASTERS	Masters 1000
2942_15	Just put a number on it. I don't care what they do. Let's just put a number on it.	2942_15.a	2010-08-19	M	2942	Robin Soderling	Andy Roddick	Do you have a recommendation on the challenge rule?	2942_15.q	13.0	1	3rd Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP MASTERS	Masters 1000
5580_0	How was the match? Pretty good. At least I win the match, so... Yeah, I think beginning of the match I play very well. Second set was a little bit tight because I was feeling, yeah, one set in target. Is more like pretty feeling one feet already in the final. But I think she play well today. So, yeah.	5580_0.a	2014-01-23	F	5580	Eugenie Bouchard	Na Li	How was the match today?	5580_0.q	4.0	1	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5580_1	I think about maybe she can play another 12 years. Of course she got more chance. She's young. She hit ball well. I think for sure she can be very good player.	5580_1.a	2014-01-23	F	5580	Eugenie Bouchard	Na Li	12 years difference in age. Do you think the experience helped you?	5580_1.q	4.0	1	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5580_2	I mean, I still has a lot of chance for every game. I still have like breakpoint, game point, but I didn't catch that. So, yeah, when she's broken my serve, I say, Okay, let me just try to play point by point because the match still have to continue. Yeah.	5580_2.a	2014-01-23	F	5580	Eugenie Bouchard	Na Li	The second set could have gone either way. A few tight service games for both of you. What were you telling yourself?	5580_2.q	4.0	1	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5580_3	No, is not easy. Really is not easy. If you want to be in the semis you have to win at least five matches. Also especially in the Grand Slam never has an easy match. Especially like today, match point, she was hit the ball in the net. I was like, Okay, now, this one, this one, more important one. Really tight end of the match. But I was play I don't know how many times for semis, so I got more experience.	5580_3.a	2014-01-23	F	5580	Eugenie Bouchard	Na Li	You've had such good results over the past four years. Does it feel easy at this point going out there for a Grand Slam semifinal?	5580_3.q	4.0	1	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5580_4	Of course nervous. Doesn't matter how many semis you play. If you play semis, still nervous because is the semis.	5580_4.a	2014-01-23	F	5580	Eugenie Bouchard	Na Li	Less nervous than your first one?	5580_4.q	4.0	1	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5580_5	I think is the third time, so pretty close to the trophy. Yeah, at least I try to not falling down this time, because last year in the final I think I play well but I only can say unlucky because falling down twice. At least I try enjoy and staying healthy.	5580_5.a	2014-01-23	F	5580	Eugenie Bouchard	Na Li	How do you feel about going into another Australian Open final having been there before? What do you learn from those times to this time?	5580_5.q	4.0	1	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5580_6	I'm not surprised. I'm now in the press conference. I didn't see the match.	5580_6.a	2014-01-23	F	5580	Eugenie Bouchard	Na Li	Are you surprised, as some of us are, that Cibulkova is now winning 61, 40 versus Radwanska?	5580_6.q	4.0	1	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5580_7	You know, I'm not God. I can't prepare everything. For me, tennis score can be 61, can be 76. If you win is win. Doesn't matter how is the score.	5580_7.a	2014-01-23	F	5580	Eugenie Bouchard	Na Li	This score, is this something you would expect or something astonishing?	5580_7.q	4.0	1	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5580_8	I think she was pretty fast legs on the court. Also she was hitter. Yeah, we play pretty like similar. So, yeah, tough match. Yeah, another challenge.	5580_8.a	2014-01-23	F	5580	Eugenie Bouchard	Na Li	If you play Cibulkova, how do you prepare?	5580_8.q	4.0	1	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5580_9	Is tough to say because if I didn't stay in national team maybe I didn't have chance to practice, you know. I'm not going to say stay national team is right or wrong. For your whole life you have to face to so many choice. You have to pick up which one is better for you.	5580_9.a	2014-01-23	F	5580	Eugenie Bouchard	Na Li	When you were younger, you did something courageous. To the Federation, you said you will set your own schedule, keep the prize money, travel. Is that something you're proud of? Would you be here now if you hadn't done that?	5580_9.q	4.0	1	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5580_10	I will send her a smile, you know. Is only I can do, yeah.	5580_10.a	2014-01-23	F	5580	Eugenie Bouchard	Na Li	If you win here, will you send Safarova a note or give her a part of your prize money?	5580_10.q	4.0	1	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5580_11	Yeah, for sure. I really feeling after the match I was getting second life in this tournament. In China, we say if you have a tough time, you pass that, it means you be so lucky. Or maybe they give me back from last year, I don't know.	5580_11.a	2014-01-23	F	5580	Eugenie Bouchard	Na Li	Do you think you're playing maybe calmer with that match being so close to maybe being at the airport?	5580_11.q	4.0	1	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5580_12	Until now, yes.	5580_12.a	2014-01-23	F	5580	Eugenie Bouchard	Na Li	So do you feel lucky here this year?	5580_12.q	4.0	1	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5580_13	You know, of course was first time come to the final, I didn't have any experience. I just feel so exciting. So when the problem is come to me, how you say, I cannot face to because nobody can help me. But I was play more and more. I got more experience. So right now final is special, you know. Final is final, but still just one match. So I still have to hit the ball to try to do my best, yeah. I cannot waiting for opponent make mistake, yeah.	5580_13.a	2014-01-23	F	5580	Eugenie Bouchard	Na Li	This will be your fourth Grand Slam final. First time you probably go in as a favorite by the rankings. How will that feel different for you?	5580_13.q	4.0	1	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5580_14	I think Michael Chang is born in America and grew up in America.	5580_14.a	2014-01-23	F	5580	Eugenie Bouchard	Na Li	You are already the most famous tennis player from Asia of all time. Is that important for you? Does it give you a lot of satisfaction? Do you know that Michael Chang, Chinese background, he won only one slam, and you may have a chance to win two.	5580_14.q	4.0	1	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5580_15	This for his family. But he is born in America. Of course. Everyone want to be famous. Doesn't matter which way, right (laughter)? Right now in this world, so many people, they make wrong decision but they still come famous. But at least I was happy I go the right way, so... Yeah, I was really happy right now. I really love my tennis life because tennis give me a lot, change my life as well. So right now I understand more about the tennis and more love about the job and more enjoy about life.	5580_15.a	2014-01-23	F	5580	Eugenie Bouchard	Na Li	But the family background.	5580_15.q	4.0	1	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5580_16	If I'm not tennis player, I didn't want to be famous. Maybe everyone is different. I always say after I retire, I want to be housewife (smiling).	5580_16.a	2014-01-23	F	5580	Eugenie Bouchard	Na Li	If you weren't a tennis player, how would you be famous?	5580_16.q	4.0	1	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5580_17	No, you know, I cannot choice. I already born in China. Of course I love my country. You can see after I win the French Open how many people stay behind me. I know when so many people ask where I from, I say Wuhan. They say small town. Not so many people. Just like 10 million (laughter). How you say, I really love the way I was grew up because I got even more experience until now. Even have some problem or something, I can face to do that. I can face to. So I was tell myself, Oh, this is challenge, especially in the tennis, and also for the life.	5580_17.a	2014-01-23	F	5580	Eugenie Bouchard	Na Li	The player you probably will play in the final is from Slovakia, four million people. When things were tough and difficult and you did not feel love, did you ever think to yourself that maybe it would be better to come from a smaller country than China?	5580_17.q	4.0	1	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5580_18	Yeah.	5580_18.a	2014-01-23	F	5580	Eugenie Bouchard	Na Li	Carlos was saying you've been visualizing, imagining, to stay calm and focused at this tournament.	5580_18.q	4.0	1	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5580_19	No, I think when I was talk to him last night, I think he saw something, so he was ask how I feel. I say, Nervous. He say, Congratulations. At least you normal people. If you cannot feel anything, I worry. Let's talk right now. Yeah, I was talk how was I'm feeling. He said, This is normal. Just don't think to too much. Just try to play tennis. You have to understand or know why you be here, what do you have to do. I was like, Okay. I was feeling like after I was talk, I was feeling open my mind. Got feeling better. I don't have to hold pressure only by myself.	5580_19.a	2014-01-23	F	5580	Eugenie Bouchard	Na Li	What are you visualizing?	5580_19.q	4.0	1	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5580_20	Is that true? I think I talked last time already. Yeah, it's true.	5580_20.a	2014-01-23	F	5580	Eugenie Bouchard	Na Li	How come a player as successful as you are only one year ago was thinking maybe to retire? Before Wimbledon you said something like you would like to stop. Is that true?	5580_20.q	4.0	1	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5580_21	Just over that, and now I will play here, you know. Just like what I say: Life always have a challenge; you just have to face to.	5580_21.a	2014-01-23	F	5580	Eugenie Bouchard	Na Li	How do you explain it?	5580_21.q	4.0	1	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
472_0	Well, yeah, as you said, three long games that lasted over 20 minutes. After that I managed to start playing better and more solid. Continued making pressure at him from the baseline, but he evidently started getting a bit tired and fatigued and started making mistakes. Obviously a set and 3Love in much as time three games took, as well. He started to come back and the crowd was trying to support him. Overall for me it was the best match so far in the tournament. It came at the right time. It's the beginning of the second week. Richard is very talented player. He's been around for a long time. He's French; he's playing at home. Obviously that makes a difference. It's not easy for any opponent playing against a French player on center court coming into the match knowing that you're going to have to face the crowd as well, you know, because logically they're going to be behind their home player. I managed to stay mentally tough, kept things together, and played a really good match.	472_0.a	2015-06-01	M	472	Richard Gasquet	Novak Djokovic	The first three games were long, but after you started dominating, how is your interpretation of the situation?	472_0.q	1.0	1	4th Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
472_1	Yes, I am. I have won many tournaments and matches this year. I still haven't lost on clay courts. Now, of course, the match that everybody anticipated or expected, it's a big quarterfinals, and I couldn't ask for a better leadup to that match.	472_1.a	2015-06-01	M	472	Richard Gasquet	Novak Djokovic	Richard said for him it was tennis made perfect. Do you feel right now you're at your best physical shape before this big match with Rafa?	472_1.q	1.0	1	4th Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
472_2	It does feel different because it's quarterfinals. I'm not used to playing him that early. But, you know, that's the reality and that's a challenge that both of us have to accept. It was always a possibility before the draw came out because he dropped in the rankings. Again, playing him here and playing him in any other tournament in the world is completely different. Conditions are very suitable to his style of the game. He loves playing on Chatrier. We will see. I never won against him at Roland Garros, but in the other hand I was close a couple of times. And the fact that I have a great season this year and I'm feeling good from every aspect of my game allows me to have belief and reason to, you know, to go on the court and try to win.	472_2.a	2015-06-01	M	472	Richard Gasquet	Novak Djokovic	Rafa said it was going to be the toughest quarterfinal he's ever had here, but not a final. He emphasized that. I'm wondering how you're approaching this. You played him five or six times here without success. Does this feel different?	472_2.q	1.0	1	4th Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
472_3	Yes.	472_3.a	2015-06-01	M	472	Richard Gasquet	Novak Djokovic	You have completely recovered from what happened during your last match, or...	472_3.q	1.0	1	4th Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
472_4	I'm still happy in Paris, yes. Honestly, I don't know. I'm trying to keep my routine together, the same every single day. The way I prepare myself for every match is going to be the same for next match.	472_4.a	2015-06-01	M	472	Richard Gasquet	Novak Djokovic	Somebody extra is coming for this quarterfinal. CostaRica or somebody of your world? You are happy still in Paris?	472_4.q	1.0	1	4th Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
472_5	Well, you can call it with different names and use different terminology. You know, I wouldn't say arrogant. Arrogant is not a great word. I would say it's just confident. Confident in life, confident in whatever you do. It is, I would agree it's in the genes and part of who we are and part of our roots and part of our ancestors that have lived in this region. So that definitely helps in sport.	472_5.a	2015-06-01	M	472	Richard Gasquet	Novak Djokovic	You made an interesting answer on the latest press conference on tennis in the Balkans. I asked the question to Goran Ivanisevic as well and Ivan Ljubicic, and they told me, It is in our gene. We are arrogant. We think we can beat anyone. What do you think of that and do you recognize it in yourself?	472_5.q	1.0	1	4th Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
472_6	Of course it is a different approach mentally when you play Nadal in quarterfinals than any other player. I mean, there is no doubt about that. I'm going to try to keep my routine the same and not give so much importance to the match. I don't want to spend too much energy before getting on the court, because I know that for me it's necessary to have every source of strength and energy possible. And I know what to do. I mean, I know what's expecting me. I have played him so many times, and the player that I have played against the most in my life. We played here, as you said, five, six times before. So I know what I need to do to have a chance to win. Doesn't mean that I will win. You know, the future is unpredictable. It's something you can't influence. I can get myself in the right state of mind and prepare well and get on the court and give my best.	472_6.a	2015-06-01	M	472	Richard Gasquet	Novak Djokovic	Do you think it makes it psychologically easier that you have played him a lot and you will play him again? How do you approach it as a quarterfinal? You have to give a lot more after that to win the title if you get through.	472_6.q	1.0	1	4th Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
472_7	The pressure is on both of us people expecting to win always in this tournament. So you can look from different perspectives, but pressure is also part of what we do, and you have to accept it. You have to deal with it and go out on the court and play.	472_7.a	2015-06-01	M	472	Richard Gasquet	Novak Djokovic	Do you think the pressure is more on you because Rafa has won so many times here and you haven't? Do you think the pressure is more on you and that could be a danger for you?	472_7.q	1.0	1	4th Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
5843_0	Yeah, obviously totally different matchup to my first match. You know, Feliciano is so crafty out there and pushes the ball around. He doesn't give you a lot of cheap points. Yeah, feels like at times he struggles to hurt you with his slice backhand, but moves it around the court really well. Just overplayed on a couple points early in the first set, and then he played a couple good points. Yeah, you know in end I was just trying to hang on in my service games through the first set and just stay only one break down. In the end it worked perfectly because I was able to draw a couple double faults out of him and obviously got that break and then broke again at 65. Once I won the first set, I felt like I was really in control.	5843_0.a	2014-01-02	M	5843	Feliciano Lopez	Lleyton Hewitt	You dug yourself a bit of a hole to start.	5843_0.q	60.0	1	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL PRESENTED BY SUNCORP	ATP250
5843_1	No. The guys that are in the quarterfinals are there for a reason. Yeah, I don't take anyone for granted. Copil will give me all the challenge I need out there tomorrow. Yeah, he's got a big game, so I'm going to have to be ready for it.	5843_1.a	2014-01-02	M	5843	Feliciano Lopez	Lleyton Hewitt	Obviously one side of the draw has opened up slightly with Gilles dropping out. Can you dare to dream about beating Roger in a final?	5843_1.q	60.0	1	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL PRESENTED BY SUNCORP	ATP250
5843_2	Not a lot. I've only seen him play a little bit here and there. He's played a lot of matches and is going to be feeling confident. That's probably one of his best wins in his career he had today against Simon, so, yeah, he'll be ready for it.	5843_2.a	2014-01-02	M	5843	Feliciano Lopez	Lleyton Hewitt	Do you know much about him?	5843_2.q	60.0	1	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL PRESENTED BY SUNCORP	ATP250
5843_3	Yeah, it's good. Lopez is a quality player. He's a quality tour player. He's been seeded at slams for a long time as well. He's crafty out there. It's good to beat quality players I guess, especially on your home soil.	5843_3.a	2014-01-02	M	5843	Feliciano Lopez	Lleyton Hewitt	Talk about satisfying wins in your career. In the last couple of years, how satisfying is today's win?	5843_3.q	60.0	1	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL PRESENTED BY SUNCORP	ATP250
5843_4	On the court or?	5843_4.a	2014-01-02	M	5843	Feliciano Lopez	Lleyton Hewitt	You looked like you've really slowed your play down a lot.	5843_4.q	60.0	1	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL PRESENTED BY SUNCORP	ATP250
5843_5	No, that's probably how he plays a little bit. He pushes a lot of balls around out there, so it's a matter of waiting and picking the right ball. He tries to draw you into overplaying out there, and that was something I was doing early and I gave him too many cheap points. When I chose to come into the net, I didn't come in on the right ball. Against a crafty guy like him, I got to pick and choose the right things.	5843_5.a	2014-01-02	M	5843	Feliciano Lopez	Lleyton Hewitt	Yeah.	5843_5.q	60.0	1	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL PRESENTED BY SUNCORP	ATP250
5843_6	Yeah, they're pretty quick. They're as quick probably as anything going around at the moment I would say, these ones are. I really don't know if Melbourne will be.	5843_6.a	2014-01-02	M	5843	Feliciano Lopez	Lleyton Hewitt	You've played on courts all over the world. How fast are these hard courts compared to some on the other hardcourts you've played on?	5843_6.q	60.0	1	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL PRESENTED BY SUNCORP	ATP250
5843_7	Yeah, close. I think on a hot day with these balls. These balls are definitely different to last year for sure. Yeah, Arthur Ashe Stadium the US Open courts have changed since I won there. When Rafter played, there was really like a sort of like nearly a glass top on it. It was really shiny out there. Now there is a lot more grit in the court which obviously slows it up and makes the balls heavier. That was what these courts were like last year. They were a lot heavier with that grit. There's very little grit out there on the court. I think it does play a little bit slower at nighttime and obviously in the humidity a little bit. Some of the outside courts during the day in the heat, it's pretty quick.	5843_7.a	2014-01-02	M	5843	Feliciano Lopez	Lleyton Hewitt	As quick as Arthur Ashe Stadium during its quickest days? That fast?	5843_7.q	60.0	1	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL PRESENTED BY SUNCORP	ATP250
5843_8	Yeah, you're just not used to it more than anything because you don't play on it that often. Yeah, once I get my eye in it I don't mine it, yeah. Shanghai is probably the only other one that's probably reasonably quick, I would say.	5843_8.a	2014-01-02	M	5843	Feliciano Lopez	Lleyton Hewitt	Is that suits you pretty well. You like quick courts, no?	5843_8.q	60.0	1	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL PRESENTED BY SUNCORP	ATP250
5843_9	It doesn't worry me. I was surprised when I hit on this court. Few people originally thought  they were worried that it could be slow, and then I came up a few weeks ago and had a hit on it and I said, You don't have to worry about it being slow. That wasn't a problem.	5843_9.a	2014-01-02	M	5843	Feliciano Lopez	Lleyton Hewitt	Would you like the same speed in Melbourne?	5843_9.q	60.0	1	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL PRESENTED BY SUNCORP	ATP250
5843_10	Physically I feel fine. No problem.	5843_10.a	2014-01-02	M	5843	Feliciano Lopez	Lleyton Hewitt	Two matches in. How are you feeling physically?	5843_10.q	60.0	1	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL PRESENTED BY SUNCORP	ATP250
5843_11	I'm happy. I've snuck out of both matches in straight sets, which is good. Been tested in both matches, which is good as well. You want to have those little mini fights out there, I guess, to save break points and hang in there and hold close service games, especially going into a Grand Slam.	5843_11.a	2014-01-02	M	5843	Feliciano Lopez	Lleyton Hewitt	Rusty at all, or you feel yourself coming along as you would like?	5843_11.q	60.0	1	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL PRESENTED BY SUNCORP	ATP250
5843_12	No, no. Too old for that.	5843_12.a	2014-01-02	M	5843	Feliciano Lopez	Lleyton Hewitt	You set yourself any specific goals?	5843_12.q	60.0	1	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL PRESENTED BY SUNCORP	ATP250
5843_13	Yeah, I think it's good for the game. Yeah, whether Lendl's success had something do with it, I don't know, but, yeah, a lot of those guys are guys that I grew up idolizing. The more we have them around the game, whether it's commentating or Davis Cup captain or coaching, whatever, it's good for the game.	5843_13.a	2014-01-02	M	5843	Feliciano Lopez	Lleyton Hewitt	Just your general take on Edberg and Becker, coming back, Bruguera, guys who played, coming into the coaching game. Just your thoughts on that.	5843_13.q	60.0	1	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL PRESENTED BY SUNCORP	ATP250
5843_14	Not really sure. That one is probably the biggest surprise, I would say, out of any of them. I don't know. I read somewhere that Marin is only I don't even know if he's coming to Australia or not. Yeah, that's a little bit strange to me. I would have thought even if Becker was there and he was going to help out in ways, you know, Marin has obviously done a pretty good job and the success rate at Melbourne Park is pretty good. Yeah, I don't know. Obviously Novak knows his game pretty well. He just want that little bit of outside influence, and he thinks Boris can do it.	5843_14.a	2014-01-02	M	5843	Feliciano Lopez	Lleyton Hewitt	Federer was saying he's a bit surprised to see Becker back in. Talk about Djokovic though. He went undefeated at the end of the year, playing at a high level, and brings in another coach. Why, in your opinion?	5843_14.q	60.0	1	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL PRESENTED BY SUNCORP	ATP250
6206_0	Well, for sure, first round as well the first match is always tricky. Like you said, slow court. I think it was very wet court. I think the courts are not always dry, it's raining every day, so it makes the courts much slower. I don't know there is really any explanation why there was eight breaks in a row, but I guess happens sometimes. But I think when I just broke myself in the end of the first set I think was more confident, and then I think I start to play much better.	6206_0.a	2014-05-25	F	6206	Shuai Zhang	Agnieszka Radwanska	In the first set, it was a little bit difficult, first eight games. What was the cause of that? Was it the slow court? Was it a little bit nerves? First round? What's your opinion about that?	6206_0.q	3.0	1	1st Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6206_1	Well, of course, but you never know when you're gonna play, and of course what the weather is gonna be. But, you know, the court is the same for everyone. Of course I'm just very happy that I won this match in two sets and pretty quickly. Just one hour on court. Still fresh and ready to go.	6206_1.a	2014-05-25	F	6206	Shuai Zhang	Agnieszka Radwanska	I know you like faster courts better. On the slow surface and looking at the weather forecast this week, a little bit rainy, a little bit slower, is it something you go out and practice a little bit on, or can you do something in your game to make you feel more comfortable on the slow, wet clay?	6206_1.q	3.0	1	1st Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6206_2	Well, I think you just have to hit the ball a bit harder. Of course I think serve is really not the powerful weapon as on the faster courts. I think also return of serve is also important.	6206_2.a	2014-05-25	F	6206	Shuai Zhang	Agnieszka Radwanska	How do you change your game when it's slower?	6206_2.q	3.0	1	1st Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6206_3	Well, everybody loved that dress. I really had a lot of good opinions.	6206_3.a	2014-05-25	F	6206	Shuai Zhang	Agnieszka Radwanska	A lot of people were enjoying your dress. I know you wore it in Rome, too. Any reactions you've gotten to it so far?	6206_3.q	3.0	1	1st Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6206_4	Well, you know, I'm third seed here, so I can't really say outsider, but, you know, clay is not really my favorite surface. But, no, I'm trying. Last year I did my first quarterfinal, so hopefully this year I can do even better.	6206_4.a	2014-05-25	F	6206	Shuai Zhang	Agnieszka Radwanska	Do you consider you as one of the favorites or one outsider?	6206_4.q	3.0	1	1st Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6206_5	To be honest, I didn't really look at the draw, so I have no idea who I'm playing next round, to be honest.	6206_5.a	2014-05-25	F	6206	Shuai Zhang	Agnieszka Radwanska	What are your thoughts on your section of the draw, if you've looked at it? There is a few interesting lower seeds there, but none of the big players who have done really well at this tournament in the past. So maybe some opportunities?	6206_5.q	3.0	1	1st Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6206_6	Well, it's a lot of really good young players are coming up. But I think the last one I saw was Bencic I think in Rome. I think that she can play really good. I think we can, we are gonna see her much more often in the future.	6206_6.a	2014-05-25	F	6206	Shuai Zhang	Agnieszka Radwanska	Of some of the young players that have been coming up and doing well this year, who, in your mind, sticks out as someone really to watch?	6206_6.q	3.0	1	1st Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6206_7	I think she can do really everything on court. You know, going down the lines, playing aggressive, and, you know, good serve, as well, and she's still young. I think, you know I think she can be really tough.	6206_7.a	2014-05-25	F	6206	Shuai Zhang	Agnieszka Radwanska	What do you like about her game?	6206_7.q	3.0	1	1st Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6206_8	What?	6206_8.a	2014-05-25	F	6206	Shuai Zhang	Agnieszka Radwanska	Last year you have good sensation here, more good than usually?	6206_8.q	3.0	1	1st Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6206_9	Of course. You know, having first quarterfinal in the Grand Slam here, of course, you know, it was success for me. I think the quarterfinal is not the last thing I want to do here. Of course I have couple years to try to do better and better here. So, well, I'm going to do everything in my power to do that and actually this year my clay court season was not bad, so hopefully I can do also good here.	6206_9.a	2014-05-25	F	6206	Shuai Zhang	Agnieszka Radwanska	Sorry for my English. Last year you were in quarterfinal, and you feel better for the first time in your life at the French?	6206_9.q	3.0	1	1st Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
5046_0	Well, it was quite a similar feeling to the one yesterday. It's another big test obviously, again a twohour match. Obviously I'm not physically out there feeling my best. Somehow feels that I always miss that half a step, you know. But I'm trying. I'm fighting. After I lost the first set today, I tried to find that inner strength. I found it again. So that's a positive thing. Every day brings a new challenge and we'll see what happens tomorrow.	5046_0.a	2013-04-18	M	5046	Juan Monaco	Novak Djokovic	Another couple of hours on court. The kind of test you needed for your ankle? How was it today?	5046_0.q	1.0	1	3rd Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
5046_1	Yeah, I got some painkillers and stuff. I wanted to ask a few questions to the doctor's team to see what they think. Said, okay, I'll give it a try, see how it goes. It went well.	5046_1.a	2013-04-18	M	5046	Juan Monaco	Novak Djokovic	The conversation at the end of the first set, was that a little bit of reassurance you wanted?	5046_1.q	1.0	1	3rd Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
5046_2	Anyway, I was going to come here, so... Playing or not playing, I would be spending my time in Monaco. So I guess, you know, not playing during the tournament and spending time in Monaco is not really something you are looking forward to (smiling). I really had a big desire to play. And, you're right, it's definitely a motivation more because I like this tournament so much and I like playing here. So I'm glad that I've made this decision and I'm glad what is most important the tournament medical team and my own professional team have agreed that I will not damage my ankle furthermore if I participate in the tournament. So for me that was the most important sign. That was a green light that I could be a part of it.	5046_2.a	2013-04-18	M	5046	Juan Monaco	Novak Djokovic	Other players in your situation after you got the injury, Davis Cup, would have said, I don't have to come here because I'm not 100%. You came here. Is it also that you have been living here a few years, that for you this is like your second home now so you feel that this is important for you and you like the tournament especially?	5046_2.q	1.0	1	3rd Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
5046_3	Well, I'm experiencing something new, you know, this week. To be honest, I think I never been in this particular situation before where wherever I start a match, it's triple the effort that I usually put in energywise because there are many things that I'm thinking about. It's the pressure of playing the match, then the ankle, so forth. Obviously I'm physically not up to my maximum capacity. So a lot of things in play. You know, I'm really proud that I managed to stay mentally positive and tough throughout the last two matches that I played here and managed to make that positive step forward in the beginning of the second set in both matches. That's something that gives me more confidence and I guess motivation to continue on playing well.	5046_3.a	2013-04-18	M	5046	Juan Monaco	Novak Djokovic	How difficult mentally is it to forget about the injury when you're playing?	5046_3.q	1.0	1	3rd Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
5046_4	Yeah (smiling).	5046_4.a	2013-04-18	M	5046	Juan Monaco	Novak Djokovic	You got the usual time violation warning.	5046_4.q	1.0	1	3rd Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
5046_5	Yeah, well, I guess I'm going to have to get used to it a little bit more now  especially this week, because I need a little bit more time. I cannot say anything against the chair umpire today because he was fair. He told me on the changeover that I'm a bit slow. After that he gave me the warning. I agree with that.	5046_5.a	2013-04-18	M	5046	Juan Monaco	Novak Djokovic	What do you feel?	5046_5.q	1.0	1	3rd Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
5046_6	Regardless of who I play against really, for me the most important thing is to feel good on the court and to compete. That's only thing that is in my mind.	5046_6.a	2013-04-18	M	5046	Juan Monaco	Novak Djokovic	What do you think about seeing Nieminen in the next round? Maybe easier than Del Potro?	5046_6.q	1.0	1	3rd Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
5046_7	I prefer 61, 61.	5046_7.a	2013-04-18	M	5046	Juan Monaco	Novak Djokovic	Every year here in MonteCarlo you experience new experiences. When you have to play with this ankle now, you focus on that, too. To play three sets instead of two, is almost better or would you prefer 61, 61?	5046_7.q	1.0	1	3rd Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
5046_8	Yeah. If you can arrange me that kind of score, I'll be very friendly to you in the future.	5046_8.a	2013-04-18	M	5046	Juan Monaco	Novak Djokovic	All the time?	5046_8.q	1.0	1	3rd Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
5046_9	Definitely it's a new experience. That's why sport is also unpredictable. You experience always something different. And I'm glad in a way. I know for the future how to, you know, kind of position myself, what kind of mindset I have to possess when I am confronting these kind of situations.	5046_9.a	2013-04-18	M	5046	Juan Monaco	Novak Djokovic	You say it's a new experience playing in this kind of situation. Do you think it will be beneficial later on in your career knowing you've been through this?	5046_9.q	1.0	1	3rd Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
5046_10	I was watching with one of the ATP officials. I asked him for what's the rules. He said for the changeover he has the right to have cramp treatment for the changeover, but he also has right to call for medical timeout, examination. Medical team can come, physiotherapist, determines if he needs or doesn't need therapy. For tiebreak, I think he was also a little bit confused. I think it's also judgment of a chair umpire if he allows him or not. That's all I can say really. It looked very strange.	5046_10.a	2013-04-18	M	5046	Juan Monaco	Novak Djokovic	As someone who sat on the Player Council, therefore involved in rule making, a player 45 down in a tiebreak sits down because of apparently cramps in his thigh.	5046_10.q	1.0	1	3rd Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
5046_11	You know, it was strange. I've never seen that. Just a few points before the end of the match, just happen like that. I guess he's going to answer better how he felt. Maybe he felt something. I don't know.	5046_11.a	2013-04-18	M	5046	Juan Monaco	Novak Djokovic	Do you think it's right you should be able to walk off court?	5046_11.q	1.0	1	3rd Round	MONTE-CARLO ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
3482_0	Yeah. I think I had chances in the second set, despite she was playing well. That big game at 4-3 when I went for two second-serve returns and I missed both of them, just pulled off a little bit on both, that was obviously disappointing. Still 4-5 down, I had chances which I didn't use. The volley that I missed. Those few mistake kind of cost me the second set. But, you know, she played well and she got a lot of balls back. In the third set I struggled a little bit physically in the beginning. Sort of went through that little bump, started to feel better a little too late.	3482_0.a	2011-08-06	F	3482	Shuai Peng	Ana Ivanovic	Kind of let it get away from you at the beginning of the third or end of the second, but still close.	3482_0.q	18.0	1	Quarterfinals	MERCURY INSURANCE OPEN	Premier
3482_1	I think my arms and legs. Just starting to feel a little fatigue because it was a lot of matches and tennis. Last night also was a tough match and I had to stay very low.	3482_1.a	2011-08-06	F	3482	Shuai Peng	Ana Ivanovic	Physically your legs were going?	3482_1.q	18.0	1	Quarterfinals	MERCURY INSURANCE OPEN	Premier
3482_2	She is. And she chases a lot of balls. Sometimes you have to win the point over and over again. She came out with some great shots, especially backhands down the line. It was very hard to pick where she was going. Yeah, it was a physical match.	3482_2.a	2011-08-06	F	3482	Shuai Peng	Ana Ivanovic	Tough, too, because she changes direction a lot, a very physical player.	3482_2.q	18.0	1	Quarterfinals	MERCURY INSURANCE OPEN	Premier
3482_3	Yeah, there was a lot of positive things. Even in today's match, there was still lots to learn from. But to play that close three-set match with a top 3 player, it's a good place to be. I'm close and I know I had a match. I know I'm not far from that level, which is very encouraging.	3482_3.a	2011-08-06	F	3482	Shuai Peng	Ana Ivanovic	Overall the week was pretty good for you, good wins, close to beating the No.3 player. You have to be pretty happy?	3482_3.q	18.0	1	Quarterfinals	MERCURY INSURANCE OPEN	Premier
3482_4	Yeah, but if I didn't go for it, still lost the point, then I wouldn't be able to sleep at night. I'll think, Why didn't I just go for it? That's my game. That's how I'm always gonna be, dominate.	3482_4.a	2011-08-06	F	3482	Shuai Peng	Ana Ivanovic	How do you make yourself maybe not go for too much on those second serves where you could have stayed in the point maybe?	3482_4.q	18.0	1	Quarterfinals	MERCURY INSURANCE OPEN	Premier
3482_5	Well, there is lots of things that kind of improved for another level. You know, my forehand is starting to come together nicely. I can rely on it. My backhand is coming through heavy. I felt tonight the backhand kind of kept me in the match. I did a lot of damage with it. My serve wasn't as good tonight as it was last night, but still it's something that can work really well.	3482_5.a	2011-08-06	F	3482	Shuai Peng	Ana Ivanovic	What parts of your game are you most encouraged about starting the hard court season and what do you feel like you need to work the most on?	3482_5.q	18.0	1	Quarterfinals	MERCURY INSURANCE OPEN	Premier
3482_6	I think even when I was younger, you know, you try to learn from every loss. Sometimes it's tough. But, you know, also I'm probably going to sit and watch a little bit of the match with my coach to see, you know, a few little things that I did wrong. Losses are never fun, especially close matches when you have chances. But it's part of the game.	3482_6.a	2011-08-06	F	3482	Shuai Peng	Ana Ivanovic	Does the veteran in you know that you'll take a lot out of a loss like this, maybe more than when you were a teenager?	3482_6.q	18.0	1	Quarterfinals	MERCURY INSURANCE OPEN	Premier
3482_7	I did.	3482_7.a	2011-08-06	F	3482	Shuai Peng	Ana Ivanovic	Did you see your draw next week?	3482_7.q	18.0	1	Quarterfinals	MERCURY INSURANCE OPEN	Premier
3482_8	We played in Eastbourne, too. I did play her a few times. It's going to be tough match. Having lots of matches this week, it's kind of going to help me to feel good coming into that match. Obviously the circumstances, the conditions are going to be different. It's tough. But I think the game is there and I'm enjoying competition and I really think I can give her a tough match, and anything is possible.	3482_8.a	2011-08-06	F	3482	Shuai Peng	Ana Ivanovic	She hasn't played since Wimbledon.	3482_8.q	18.0	1	Quarterfinals	MERCURY INSURANCE OPEN	Premier
2496_0	Well, it's a welcome change always. You know, it's a much more comfortable adjustment for me. I'm excited to be here.	2496_0.a	2010-06-08	M	2496	Igor Kunitsyn	Andy Roddick	How does it feel to have grass back under your feet again?	2496_0.q	7.0	1	2nd Round	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
2496_1	I'm probably about half and half as far as ones that I've won comfortably. I've gone three sets a couple of times here first round. I'm not sure you can generalize. But I guess as I've played more in my career, even the first couple practice days, they feel -- and get on grass and the second day I feel fine. I guess in that sense it's gotten easier.	2496_1.a	2010-06-08	M	2496	Igor Kunitsyn	Andy Roddick	Does the first match get easier year by year?	2496_1.q	7.0	1	2nd Round	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
2496_2	There is no such thing in sports as too easy, you know, especially with the sun going down on a slippery court.	2496_2.a	2010-06-08	M	2496	Igor Kunitsyn	Andy Roddick	Is that win almost too easy?	2496_2.q	7.0	1	2nd Round	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
2496_3	Yeah, but the only thing is grass court events, not and leadup -- I would sacrifice grass courts in the States for grass court tournaments and lead up to Wimbledon, you know. I would love three months of 1000 tournaments in the leadup to Wimbledon.	2496_3.a	2010-06-08	M	2496	Igor Kunitsyn	Andy Roddick	When you have long since hung up your racquet and there is the Andy Roddick Tournament in Austin, Texas, or wherever, would you like to hold it on a grass court? Would you like to see grass courts back in the States more?	2496_3.q	7.0	1	2nd Round	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
2496_4	Well, no. I'm just saying there's -- you know, the US Open Series, there's two-and-a-half months of leadup and a thousand points on the line every other week for two months. We have a couple 250s before Wimbledon. So for me that's just a glaring issue, you know. So I think before we talk about grandiose ideas of a season in the States on grass, you know, we should probably take care of that first.	2496_4.a	2010-06-08	M	2496	Igor Kunitsyn	Andy Roddick	Getting rid of that red stuff?	2496_4.q	7.0	1	2nd Round	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
2496_5	Well, I mean, 500 at least. I know they're pretty -- ATP is very staunch in their rules, and I can respect that, but, you know, to make it -- you know, I think you should reward all surfaces. Obviously there's a lot of business and logistical stuff behind the scenes that would have to take place, but yes, I do think that's a realistic idea. I don't think it's ridiculously far-fetched.	2496_5.a	2010-06-08	M	2496	Igor Kunitsyn	Andy Roddick	Is that a realistic possibility that that would ever happen?	2496_5.q	7.0	1	2nd Round	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
2496_6	Sure. Yeah, I mean, you know, like I said, I think it's pretty -- you know, I know all the guys who enjoy grass as much as we do wish we had three months of it, you know, or even, you know, a couple of extra weeks of it. So I think it gets talked about, but you're gonna get, as much as my opinion is extremely biased, you're gonna get a lot the other way that's extremely biased. But, you know, I'm aware that I'm biased. I'm also aware of the discrepancy between tournaments. That's not up for -- that's not someone's opinion. That's just the facts.	2496_6.a	2010-06-08	M	2496	Igor Kunitsyn	Andy Roddick	Do you talk to the other guys about it? Does it ever come up in conversation?	2496_6.q	7.0	1	2nd Round	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
2496_7	Sure.	2496_7.a	2010-06-08	M	2496	Igor Kunitsyn	Andy Roddick	You see, from our perspective we look at the calendar and we say there are two great big American hardcourt tournaments in the spring. Then there's clay. Then there's grass.	2496_7.q	7.0	1	2nd Round	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
2496_8	Yeah. No, I agree.	2496_8.a	2010-06-08	M	2496	Igor Kunitsyn	Andy Roddick	Then there's another big American season in the summer.	2496_8.q	7.0	1	2nd Round	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
2496_9	No, mine isn't so much a geographical thing as opposed to, you know, a surface thing. But, you know, it comes down to -- you know, we all know what it comes down to. You know, this is a business at the end of the day, so you're going to go where you can generate. But I also think that London has proven, with this tournament today -- I mean, you go out there, it's 8:30 at night, and they're still three quarters full for a doubles match. Having been a spectator at Masters last November, I thought it was a great event. I think there's no question that London supports its tennis. I don't see that as an issue. I think before we get to the address of pulling in four other weeks here and two other weeks here and pointing out -- let's fix the week we're in. Let's make it worth it, you know.	2496_9.a	2010-06-08	M	2496	Igor Kunitsyn	Andy Roddick	Something's got to give.	2496_9.q	7.0	1	2nd Round	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
2496_10	Well, I think a lot maybe changed after Wimbledon last year. You know, why? I don't know. I feel like I've worked hard at what I do for a long time. You know, for some reason, you know, it hit home during that tournament for a lot of people last year. I certainly think the sentiment is maybe a little bit different now.	2496_10.a	2010-06-08	M	2496	Igor Kunitsyn	Andy Roddick	Have you seen a way that the fan reaction to you has changed at all this year compared to other years?	2496_10.q	7.0	1	2nd Round	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
2496_11	I mean, that, you know, tennis -- you know, it's an individual sport and it's a player-driven sport. So I think, you know, that normally happens. I probably think the weather might have had something to do with that. They had to have something to watch.	2496_11.a	2010-06-08	M	2496	Igor Kunitsyn	Andy Roddick	Today when you were practicing there were more people probably watching you practice than on some of the courts where players were playing.	2496_11.q	7.0	1	2nd Round	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
2496_12	Semifinal?	2496_12.a	2010-06-08	M	2496	Igor Kunitsyn	Andy Roddick	Since you got here, how many times have people mentioned last year's Wimbledon semifinal?	2496_12.q	7.0	1	2nd Round	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
2496_13	No, I mean, no more -- I mean, it's not any more than I would have expected. You know, all of a sudden you come to this part of the year. You know, last year's grass court season becomes relevant again. So, yeah, I mean, it comes up a lot. It's come up a lot for me just over the course of the year, so it's not anything, you know, jarring or different or, you know, anything more than -- I expect it. I expected it a little bit. I mean, it makes sense.	2496_13.a	2010-06-08	M	2496	Igor Kunitsyn	Andy Roddick	Sorry, final.	2496_13.q	7.0	1	2nd Round	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
2496_14	Oh, sure, sure. I mean, I think -- yeah. I mean, a lot -- I think a lot's different. I think people get a sense that they probably know you a little bit better. You know, you've developed a relationship with people somewhat over the course of six or seven years. I think that changes. Obviously the type of match it was changes a lot, you know. People view that a lot differently I think.	2496_14.a	2010-06-08	M	2496	Igor Kunitsyn	Andy Roddick	Has there been as much reaction -- was there more reaction to last year than, for example, to your first Wimbledon final?	2496_14.q	7.0	1	2nd Round	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
2496_15	Well, to be honest, I haven't watched it back, and I don't really remember a whole lot of what I said. I was in such a daze. I was praying that Sue Barker wasn't going to ask me to talk, because I didn't know if I was going to be able to get through it or not. You know, I've always -- if nothing else, I've always been pretty forthright and pretty honest with everyone. I think in that moment it might have come off okay.	2496_15.a	2010-06-08	M	2496	Igor Kunitsyn	Andy Roddick	I think also, you know, post-final speeches normally don't say very much, but what you said really caught the British public's imagination.	2496_15.q	7.0	1	2nd Round	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
2496_16	I don't know. It's not something I've deliberately -- I'm sure if it was on TV somewhere and it was a rerun I'd probably watch it, you know, if I didn't have a round of golf or something. (Laughter.) It's not something I -- I'm sure I will. I don't think I'm gonna live the rest of my existence without watching, you know, probably the best match that I've been a part of. You know, I don't know if I'm going to go watch it tomorrow, but yeah, I probably will at some point.	2496_16.a	2010-06-08	M	2496	Igor Kunitsyn	Andy Roddick	You say you haven't watched it. Will you watch the final at some stage in the future?	2496_16.q	7.0	1	2nd Round	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
3421_0	Well, it was difficult match, difficult conditions. I think out of all the surfaces I played with Flavia, it's the one that suits her a lot because it's fast and can she use my power. She has quick hands, good timing. She was doing pretty well. I'm happy I managed to hold my serve few times in the second set, and I managed to break her in the end. I was trying to be aggressive. You have to realize when you try to be aggressive you're going to do few unforced errors. I don't have to be frustrated, but still it's frustrate me a lot sometimes. But I managed to win 6-4, 6-4. The game was very equal. I think the key points I was playing a little bit better than her.	3421_0.a	2011-02-19	F	3421	Flavia Pennetta	Svetlana Kuznetsova	What are your thoughts on that?	3421_0.q	23.0	1	Semifinals	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS WOMEN	Premier
3421_1	Yeah, yeah, because I tried to be aggressive because I see the space. I know my shots. I know exactly. But sometimes I'm going for too much because I want to do it too good. Sometimes I get her out of the court, and then I want to close the point fast. But if the rush, I don't look the ball properly, and I hit with the frame and mishit it. Sometimes just some few points frustrate me, because to go higher level I have to win these points. That's the only thing I want to work on.	3421_1.a	2011-02-19	F	3421	Flavia Pennetta	Svetlana Kuznetsova	You were saying on the court that you didn't feel you played your best match. Was it the unforced errors?	3421_1.q	23.0	1	Semifinals	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS WOMEN	Premier
3421_2	I mean, on paper it's nothing. I say it one more time. It's like I was out of top 20. I think now I'm in top 20. I'm not sure what's going to be my ranking if I win or lose. Doesn't really matter. What matters the most is my game. My game is back. Maybe not in the highest, highest level, but I'm competing against best players and beating top 10 players and I'm comfortable on the court. I know which moment for time to win, and I'm happy. Because I know and I realize what happened in the court, because last year I did not. So I'm in the finals. It's great for me. Tomorrow it's one more match to play. I just want to go out there and to see how I can compare myself to No.1, what I have to work on, and to do my best. Definitely I have me my possibilities and my chances.	3421_2.a	2011-02-19	F	3421	Flavia Pennetta	Svetlana Kuznetsova	In the tournament itself, you've obviously beaten some top-ranked players. You came in as the 16th seed. How do you feel you've progressed in this tournament?	3421_2.q	23.0	1	Semifinals	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS WOMEN	Premier
3421_3	Yeah, I mean, especially like first six, seven months of the year...	3421_3.a	2011-02-19	F	3421	Flavia Pennetta	Svetlana Kuznetsova	You say you're back. What's the difference between maybe some points last year and now? What's the difference in your game?	3421_3.q	23.0	1	Semifinals	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS WOMEN	Premier
3421_4	Yes. It was disaster. I was just playing ping-pong tennis or something else. Not my game. This is all I say. I could go either way. And with any player, I was losing to -- like I don't know, maybe I had six, seven first-round loses. So for myself it's very unusual. Then I won San Diego, because after Wimbledon I stop. I started to work with Larissa. I start to think, What's wrong? What I am doing wrong on the court? Where I have to bring my game back? So we work really hard. Then U.S. series I played better already. Then I got sick, and then I played last tournaments because I had to play them. Then I pull out just to rest and recover and get my game back. I think I've done all I could, and now I have lots of matches to play. I'm really happy and lucky to play them. Just that's it.	3421_4.a	2011-02-19	F	3421	Flavia Pennetta	Svetlana Kuznetsova	Last year?	3421_4.q	23.0	1	Semifinals	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS WOMEN	Premier
3421_5	Yeah, since I came to Russia I think I kind of missed it, because in Russia they quite don't get my game, some people. But, I mean, I appreciate all coaches in Russia who work with me. I been changing a lot. This is maybe also my fault. Maybe I have to discuss with the coach what we have to work on before the match, before working with the coach. They just see the game differently, and I cannot play this game. I have my understanding. I cannot take new coach and he teach me again how to play tennis how he sees it. I'm all right constructive player and person. It's impossible to change me. You can add and correct things, but not change.	3421_5.a	2011-02-19	F	3421	Flavia Pennetta	Svetlana Kuznetsova	You mentioned the use of spin. Is this something you used to do more earlier in your career that you stopped doing?	3421_5.q	23.0	1	Semifinals	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS WOMEN	Premier
3421_6	You know, I was not tired, but I was very slow somehow. I felt slow today. It's because sometimes takes me a few games to warm up. Tomorrow I cannot let myself do that. I realize that. (Smiling.)	3421_6.a	2011-02-19	F	3421	Flavia Pennetta	Svetlana Kuznetsova	You had two tough matches before this one. No ill effects from those matches? You weren't tired today at all?	3421_6.q	23.0	1	Semifinals	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS WOMEN	Premier
3421_7	I tried to battle. Without battle, you can just go take your plane ticket and go back home. I love to battle. I love to play and to run and to play spin and different combination. I think we had some good rallies today, even it's hard to play on this court. It's very fast. It's hard to have lots of long rallies.	3421_7.a	2011-02-19	F	3421	Flavia Pennetta	Svetlana Kuznetsova	You must be pleased with the way you battled back, because Flavia I think broke your serve four times. But immediately you sort of got back on top of her and eventually broke her near the end there to close it out. That shows battling qualities on your behalf.	3421_7.q	23.0	1	Semifinals	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS WOMEN	Premier
3421_8	You're from her country, right? Where you are from?	3421_8.a	2011-02-19	F	3421	Flavia Pennetta	Svetlana Kuznetsova	You mentioned a fast start against Caroline. What else do you need to do to beat her tomorrow?	3421_8.q	23.0	1	Semifinals	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS WOMEN	Premier
3421_9	Oh, I'm sorry. I never seen you before and you straight ask about her, so... What I have to do? I have to be aggressive for sure. I have to stay calm and to play my game and just do less unforced errors. Serve well. That's it.	3421_9.a	2011-02-19	F	3421	Flavia Pennetta	Svetlana Kuznetsova	I'm based here.	3421_9.q	23.0	1	Semifinals	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS WOMEN	Premier
3421_10	I mean, I still was aggressive. I still played my game.	3421_10.a	2011-02-19	F	3421	Flavia Pennetta	Svetlana Kuznetsova	You said you weren't totally happy with today. What were the keys today to winning the match against Flavia?	3421_10.q	23.0	1	Semifinals	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS WOMEN	Premier
3421_11	Yeah, like in terms, I think it's important that I tried many things today, but in important key moments I was coming back to the basics. That's it.	3421_11.a	2011-02-19	F	3421	Flavia Pennetta	Svetlana Kuznetsova	In terms of your game.	3421_11.q	23.0	1	Semifinals	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS WOMEN	Premier
3421_12	I'm relaxed. You know, sometimes I think, so I win on lose, what happens? What changes? The world wouldn't change. I have less or more points or money in my pocket, it's not going to change me. Definitely I want to be somewhere in the top of the game. But it's important, health, the family, the people to be healthy. Not have any terror attacks in countries. That's the important things in the life.	3421_12.a	2011-02-19	F	3421	Flavia Pennetta	Svetlana Kuznetsova	You seemed very relaxed and confident throughout the match.	3421_12.q	23.0	1	Semifinals	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS WOMEN	Premier
3421_13	You recommend to be relaxed tomorrow for me as well?	3421_13.a	2011-02-19	F	3421	Flavia Pennetta	Svetlana Kuznetsova	You seem so relaxed on the last couple of points, and you produced two terrific shots.	3421_13.q	23.0	1	Semifinals	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS WOMEN	Premier
3421_14	I will think about it.	3421_14.a	2011-02-19	F	3421	Flavia Pennetta	Svetlana Kuznetsova	You know better than me.	3421_14.q	23.0	1	Semifinals	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS WOMEN	Premier
3421_15	Yeah, I mean, when you go ahead in the game, everybody basically of who plays good level, everybody goes ahead and they relax and they play better.	3421_15.a	2011-02-19	F	3421	Flavia Pennetta	Svetlana Kuznetsova	The two forehands that you produced seemed to come because you were very confident and relaxed.	3421_15.q	23.0	1	Semifinals	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS WOMEN	Premier
3421_16	Am I?	3421_16.a	2011-02-19	F	3421	Flavia Pennetta	Svetlana Kuznetsova	One last thing. In terms of the top 10, if you win tomorrow you go into the top 10. Is that a motivator?	3421_16.q	23.0	1	Semifinals	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS WOMEN	Premier
3421_17	11. That's not top 10. I mean, it's quite fast, but I been working really hard for this pre-season.	3421_17.a	2011-02-19	F	3421	Flavia Pennetta	Svetlana Kuznetsova	11. 13 or 11.	3421_17.q	23.0	1	Semifinals	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS WOMEN	Premier
3982_0	Absolutely. It means so much to be back in a Grand Slam final, a stage I have been to before few years ago here. It's nice to get that far again after losing quite early in the last couple of years. So, yeah, it means a lot to me. I played someone that's just had really great results and has beaten me the last couple of times. I just really wanted it today. Yeah, I fought to the last point. You know, she had so many opportunities in that third set, and I just hung on and just really went for it.	3982_0.a	2012-01-26	F	3982	Petra Kvitova	Maria Sharapova	Your emotions at the end of the match seemed to show that this just meant a fair bit to you, this opportunity.	3982_0.q	4.0	1	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3982_1	Um, yeah, it's a few years ago. I don't know. Every year is different. Just in terms of obviously you grow a little bit older, you know, a lot of things in your life happen. But at the end of the day, to get back at that stage is special.	3982_1.a	2012-01-26	F	3982	Petra Kvitova	Maria Sharapova	That last win here seems a long time ago. How different are you from now till then?	3982_1.q	4.0	1	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3982_2	Well, I played Petra in her first Grand Slam final. She played really highquality tennis out there on the grass, and, you know, she went out there and it didn't really affect her. So, you know, even though Victoria hasn't really been in that stage of a Grand Slam before, she's certainly won big titles and she has the experience. This is a stage she's wanted to be at for a long time, so I do expect her to play really good tennis.	3982_2.a	2012-01-26	F	3982	Petra Kvitova	Maria Sharapova	How daunting will be it be for Azarenka going into her first Grand Slam final. How do you think she will be feeling?	3982_2.q	4.0	1	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3982_3	Well, in the first set I felt like my pace hurt her a bit. I was just really aggressive. I didn't give her a chance to really step in and do what she does really well. You know, it was really it's always, you know, against an opponent where you have kind of similar games where we're both very aggressive players and pretty powerful shots, you know, if she's dictating from the start and I'm always in the defense, and points are usually going to go her way. I try to take that away from her. In the second set it was one break and I couldn't get it back. Obviously she was up a break in the third. I managed to get it back. Just hung on. There were so many games where it was 1540, Love30 on my serve, and actually on those points hit some pretty big serves, and then, you know, in the last game made some returns, you know; whereas in the whole third set she was serving quite well. I didn't feel like I had too many good looks on returns. In the third set, that last game of the third, I really managed to get some returns back.	3982_3.a	2012-01-26	F	3982	Petra Kvitova	Maria Sharapova	What do you think is different today compared to that Wimbledon final? What do you think you did better?	3982_3.q	4.0	1	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3982_4	You never really know until you challenge and you just see on the screen. Um, yeah, sometimes you feel like it was in by a mile, and you look at the challenge and just embarrassing that you even asked for the call. (Smiling). But I did feel like that one was very close, and it was right on the line. So, yeah, it's obviously an important point.	3982_4.a	2012-01-26	F	3982	Petra Kvitova	Maria Sharapova	That challenge you made at 4All in the third  it was Love30, would have been Love40  how sure were you of that call, and how much of a turning point do you think that was? Seemed the momentum totally changed in the end after that.	3982_4.q	4.0	1	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3982_5	Um, yeah, but it was still you know, it's not like I got that point. It was still Love30, so you had to play that point over and still try to win the game from Love30.	3982_5.a	2012-01-26	F	3982	Petra Kvitova	Maria Sharapova	Did that change momentum?	3982_5.q	4.0	1	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3982_6	Um, I did, but I felt like in the important moments I had some really good serves. And like I said, in the games where I was down Love30 and 1540, I hit some really good second serves. I think she wanted to step in and maybe go for it, and I was smart about that. Yeah, so in the end obviously would like to see that number lower. But when you're playing, you know, an opponent that has a really good return, sometimes you go for it a little bit more. If you end up missing some, sometimes it can help you. Because if you hit pretty slow first serves just to get them in or second serves, your opponent is going to take advantage of that.	3982_6.a	2012-01-26	F	3982	Petra Kvitova	Maria Sharapova	You had some trouble with your serve. You had the 10 double faults and everything. What was going on there?	3982_6.q	4.0	1	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3982_7	I do. This is obviously what I train for and why I go out on the court and try to improve for moments like this. You have them four times a year, and these are the big ones for us, the important ones. It's really where you kinda have to find a way to win and step up when it really matters. You know, today was just a good example of that for me. I felt like I was down and out. There are times where, you know, I felt like she was just returning too good. I just kept going for it.	3982_7.a	2012-01-26	F	3982	Petra Kvitova	Maria Sharapova	You won a title so early in your career. Do you get the sense you can appreciate the opportunity a little bit more now?	3982_7.q	4.0	1	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3982_8	It's the way my career path has gone, and I don't regret anything that has happened. Obviously it would have been nice not to have a serious injury at 21 years old, but sometimes it's just the way things go. Good thing is that I found a way to come back.	3982_8.a	2012-01-26	F	3982	Petra Kvitova	Maria Sharapova	Has it been frustrating at times to not get back to that Grand Slam title after having that success earlier?	3982_8.q	4.0	1	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3982_9	Um, I mean, as positive as I always try to be, you always question what you're doing, obviously, because sometimes things work out and sometimes they don't. And especially just with the shoulder I think it was  I knew some examples of some people that did not quite recover from surgery and that was a little frightening, but I really had no option. So it was either give it a go or not do anything about it. Of course it took a long time and it was a process, but it was just something that was in my steps that I had to go through. And I did.	3982_9.a	2012-01-26	F	3982	Petra Kvitova	Maria Sharapova	Did you ever consider you wouldn't get back to your best?	3982_9.q	4.0	1	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3982_10	I feel happy and excited that I still have a chance to play the sport and play it at this level and be in a Grand Slam final.	3982_10.a	2012-01-26	F	3982	Petra Kvitova	Maria Sharapova	Do you feel better than ever now?	3982_10.q	4.0	1	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3982_11	Well, when I came back I had to start with a different motion because, I mean, I wanted to come back so early. I couldn't quite come back as early as I wanted to. It came to a point where if you don't want to hurt things, then, you know, maybe you have to make some adjustments. That was probably a tough adjustment, because even though I changed motions many times in my career, I had to really go to a really different one which was very short and very compact. I was not used to that because I have long arms and I'm just used to kind of longer things and longer swings. But I had to do that in the beginning, and that was the toughest thing, yeah.	3982_11.a	2012-01-26	F	3982	Petra Kvitova	Maria Sharapova	How long did it actually take you to find a serve that you were comfortable with once you came back to the game?	3982_11.q	4.0	1	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3982_12	I mean, she's a really, really good player, and like you said, I haven't had great success against her in the last couple of events that we've played against each other. I'd really like to change that. Yeah, it will be important to tactically play right. You know, she makes you hit a lot of balls and she's aggressive, as well. But, yeah, it's the final, so...	3982_12.a	2012-01-26	F	3982	Petra Kvitova	Maria Sharapova	Victoria has beaten you in two finals before?	3982_12.q	4.0	1	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3982_13	Yeah. If I'm playing well, that's usually kind of how my game is. If I'm playing defensive or on the defense, then my chances are pretty bad.	3982_13.a	2012-01-26	F	3982	Petra Kvitova	Maria Sharapova	So is there a really aggressive mindset that you need, too?	3982_13.q	4.0	1	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3982_14	Um, today or in general?	3982_14.a	2012-01-26	F	3982	Petra Kvitova	Maria Sharapova	Is it tough to play an opponent that has such a similar game to you?	3982_14.q	4.0	1	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3982_15	Yeah, but everyone is different, and I guess that's why we play against each other. I don't think two players are the same. Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses. But, yeah, I don't think it really matters.	3982_15.a	2012-01-26	F	3982	Petra Kvitova	Maria Sharapova	Well, Victoria I think might have a more similar game to you than Petra does.	3982_15.q	4.0	1	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3982_16	Um, having been in the position before, doesn't really to me. I think personally, for me, it's more about the Grand Slam win than the No.1 ranking. That's just always been the goal for me.	3982_16.a	2012-01-26	F	3982	Petra Kvitova	Maria Sharapova	This is going to be a headtohead battle for No.1 ranking. Does that add anything to it, do you think?	3982_16.q	4.0	1	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4101_0	Twinge means pain?	4101_0.a	2012-01-16	M	4101	nan	Roger Federer	Everything fine, moving okay, twingefree?	4101_0.q	3.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4101_1	Yeah. I mean, I expected  otherwise honestly I would've been worried and I would have mentioned something. I'm not keeping secrets about that stuff. But I've been feeling fine for three, four days now. Been able to practice full out. Today was fine. It was just tough against a guy who hits big and flat from both sides and takes a lot of chances. In some ways, for the first match, it was a bit more  how do you say  intense, where I felt a lot of pressure. Because in Abu Dhabi they were exhibitions, and then in Doha, the first match with Davydenko was somewhat straightforward. Then after that I got injured. So everything was a bit on a relaxeder [sic] mode maybe, or then trying to come through with injury or the matches were too easy, you know. Here I really tried to put in an effort to every point play as hard as I could first to see how the back felt, try to get into it, hopefully win, and then see how I feel tomorrow. I'll get a lot more information tomorrow, but I'm sure I'll be fine.	4101_1.a	2012-01-16	M	4101	nan	Roger Federer	Yes. Everything good?	4101_1.q	3.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4101_2	No, I mean, I don't mind the heat. Actually, I would have liked to play in the heat. It's been a tricky week in terms of practice because there's been a lot of rain. I practiced twice indoors. This has definitely been the hottest since we've been here. When I was warming up, the ball was definitely flying much more than, again, tonight, because conditions get significantly slower in these types of conditions. Look, I'm just happy to be on Rod Laver Arena. Sure, nights is always quite something. It's electric and it's nice to be out there.	4101_2.a	2012-01-16	M	4101	nan	Roger Federer	Good day to play at night probably because of the heat.	4101_2.q	3.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4101_3	Yeah, I mean, I kind of heard it, you know. I saw him after he said the comments  Sunday was it, I guess? I saw him Sunday afternoon. I asked him how the press went. I didn't know he spoke to the press. He said, Yeah, it was fine. Mentioned a few things here and there. I was, Okay, whatever. Then I read the comments. So things are fine between us, you know. I have no hard feelings towards him. It's been a difficult last few months in terms of politics within the ATP, I guess, trying to find a new CEO and chairman. That can get frustrating sometimes. He's mentioned many times how he gets a bit tired and frustrated through the whole process, and I shared that with him. It's normal. But for me, obviously nothing changes in terms of our relationship. I'm completely cool and relaxed about it. He seemed the same way  or at least I hope so.	4101_3.a	2012-01-16	M	4101	nan	Roger Federer	I'm sure you would have been made aware of some of the things that Rafael Nadal said in here yesterday. You could call it criticism of you, perhaps. Certainly the comments were quite outspoken. In those circumstances, do you have any response to what I'm sure you've been told he said?	4101_3.q	3.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4101_4	You want to know the issues or?	4101_4.a	2012-01-16	M	4101	nan	Roger Federer	It's fair to say you have differing views in terms of what should happen.	4101_4.q	3.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4101_5	Yeah, I think that's normal. We can't always agree on everything. So far it's always been no problem really. Back in the day he used to say, Whatever Roger decides, I'm fine with. Today he's much more grown up. He has a strong opinion himself, which I think is great. It's what we need, especially on the council. It's been nice working with him. That he has a strong opinion also creates sometimes good arguments about where you want to move the sport forward to. You know, we talked about that in London after we played at midnight before, I don't know, my semifinal match. We called each other after Davis Cup, and then we met again here. So we're always constantly trying to get on the same page, or at least talking about it, so we can do the best for the sport. That's at the end of the day both our goals.	4101_5.a	2012-01-16	M	4101	nan	Roger Federer	He said you've got one view and the others have got something else.	4101_5.q	3.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4101_6	I was in the meeting, you know. I completely understand and support the players' opinions. I just have a different way of going at it. I'm not discussing it with you guys in the press room. It creates unfortunately sometimes negative stories. I think we've done really well over the years now since me and Rafa in particular have joined the council, and also Novak in the past. And when Adam led the ATP, I think we had a really calm relationship about politics and about, you know, dealing with you guys. So I choose not to talk about those issues with you guys. That doesn't mean I don't support the players. I think of the players first. Usually when I take decisions, I think of the lowerranked players first. I hope they know that. Otherwise I wouldn't be sitting on the council, just trying to do what's best for the top guys. I mean, I've been around for too long to just say, Okay, we need more stuff for the top guys. I'm very happy if the lowerranked players are doing better, too.	4101_6.a	2012-01-16	M	4101	nan	Roger Federer	Specifically are you willing to talk about the point that possibly you sometimes stand outside the process, maybe not getting behind some of the top 100 players, or does that come back to the differences in points of view, for example, pushing for changes to prize money, things like that?	4101_6.q	3.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4101_7	You know, it's such a dangerous word to use. That's why I always say, Let's try to avoid it as much as we can, right? I think that would be the best for all of us: you guys, fans, tournaments, players. It's not good for anyone really. We've seen it in other sports happening in the States. That's why I'm always very careful about it. If there's no avoiding it, I'll support the rest of the players. But I just think we have to think it through how we do it, if we do it, can we do it, whatever it is, instead of just going out and screaming about it. That's not how I think you're going to get results. There's been too many tries and too many things done in the past that haven't worked. That's where I just think we're on the right track and things are under control, I think. I'm confident we'll get to a good solution in the near future.	4101_7.a	2012-01-16	M	4101	nan	Roger Federer	Do you disagree with the concept of a strike in principle, or do you just think it wouldn't work?	4101_7.q	3.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4101_8	One argument?	4101_8.a	2012-01-16	M	4101	nan	Roger Federer	There seemed to be so many mentions of so many different issues, bits of this issue here, that issue there, prize money, Davis Cup, whatever. How important is it that there is one argument from the players' point of view?	4101_8.q	3.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4101_9	I don't quite understand. I just want to make sure I understand you.	4101_9.a	2012-01-16	M	4101	nan	Roger Federer	Just one, a consistent view. Is that important, in your opinion?	4101_9.q	3.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4101_10	Well, it's not normally that bad, but... It's usually two or three. Well, there are more, many more, but they're smaller problems. Sometimes do you want to play white balls or yellow balls. Is that going to be a big issue? Sometimes yes; sometimes no. It depends on how big the issue is and how it impacts every layer of the tour. That's sometimes how you go at it. Obviously within the system, you can't ask every single opinion, but you try to represent every opinion that you have and you try to work on all those issues. I thought we're going in a good direction. I thought the game was healthy. We're in a golden era right now. Everybody is happy, talking positive. We've been able to sign sponsors. We've been playing well. Al those things. But I understand we can always try to do better. It shouldn't be just saying like, Things are great. Let's not change anything. I think as a perfectionist, professional, whatever you do in the business or as a tennis player, I think you should always try to become as good as you can be or try to just, you know, change things to as good as they can be for everyone.	4101_10.a	2012-01-16	M	4101	nan	Roger Federer	You ask 10 players, you might get 10 different issues raised.	4101_10.q	3.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4101_11	Potentially. I don't know. I really don't have the crystal ball with me. I wish I knew. But, like I said before, I'm confident that we'll manage the year in a good way and we'll come to good terms with whatever it is. Right now I don't know what it is, but I'm sure it's going to be okay.	4101_11.a	2012-01-16	M	4101	nan	Roger Federer	Is it perhaps taking it too far to say this could be potentially a defining year in the relationship between the players, the tournaments, the Grand Slams?	4101_11.q	3.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4101_12	Not really. I mean, I feel pressure coming out and seeing my girls on the other side of the court, seeing me walk on court. Maybe that makes me nervous, which was the case today. But otherwise I feel not particularly more pressure. I'm always excited. I felt it, you know, actually walking down that Walk of Champions, getting out on court and feeling like, you know what, I have good intensity and I am really excited to see the Aussie crowd. Just go after another victory here hopefully in the first round, and then take it from there. So I was anxious to find out how I was going to play, how my opponent was going to play me. So, yeah, I was really excited and a little nervous actually going into it, which was a good feeling to have. I'm looking forward to the other matches.	4101_12.a	2012-01-16	M	4101	nan	Roger Federer	Do you feel extra pressure coming to this tournament since it's been a while since you won a Grand Slam, almost two years?	4101_12.q	3.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
1492_0	Well, I mean, it's tough. I came to the match. I mean, I thought I was ready, but I didn't really play my game. I was just everything back. But she was playing unbelievable every point. I couldn't find my rhythm, couldn't find my game. I mean, that's how you lose, I guess.	1492_0.a	2008-08-02	F	1492	Tamira Paszek	Victoria Azarenka	How come you lost the first set 6-Love?	1492_0.q	16.0	1	Quarterfinals	ROGERS CUP PRESENTED BY NATIONAL BANK	1
1492_1	I mean, I had to change something because like this I couldn't even win one game. So I had to step in and play more aggressive, and that's how I found my rhythm, put much more pressure on her, and it was a different game after.	1492_1.a	2008-08-02	F	1492	Tamira Paszek	Victoria Azarenka	What did you tell yourself between the first and second set? How were you able to come back?	1492_1.q	16.0	1	Quarterfinals	ROGERS CUP PRESENTED BY NATIONAL BANK	1
1492_2	Well, the first three games, they were really close. I mean, it was not like somebody was commanding more and somebody was backing off. It was just very tight playing every point good. And then I just started playing a little bit more defensive, let her play her game. That's how, I mean, she got back again into the rhythm and started playing more, putting more pressure on me. But, I mean, from 5-1, I was able to come back a little bit. But the last game, she was serving unbelievable. I didn't have a chance to get back more.	1492_2.a	2008-08-02	F	1492	Tamira Paszek	Victoria Azarenka	End of the second, beginning of the third, were you really fatigued?	1492_2.q	16.0	1	Quarterfinals	ROGERS CUP PRESENTED BY NATIONAL BANK	1
1492_3	Well, I think I'm playing aggressive. I just have so many things to improve now. I just need to come in more. I think my character that I'm playing is the baseliner, aggressive baseliner.	1492_3.a	2008-08-02	F	1492	Tamira Paszek	Victoria Azarenka	How would you characterize your style of play?	1492_3.q	16.0	1	Quarterfinals	ROGERS CUP PRESENTED BY NATIONAL BANK	1
1492_4	Yeah, but just last week. But that was very different match. I got injured right before our match. I mean, it was a little bit still injured here. But that match was just whole different story. I wasn't in my best shape. But she was playing really great there. As you can see, she's playing -- since clay court season, Berlin, she's playing amazing. I think she's just playing like a No.1 player in the world.	1492_4.a	2008-08-02	F	1492	Tamira Paszek	Victoria Azarenka	You had another match against her not too long ago.	1492_4.q	16.0	1	Quarterfinals	ROGERS CUP PRESENTED BY NATIONAL BANK	1
3117_0	What I can say? Just, I won. I won. It was not the best match I did, but anyway, it was semifinal and you have to win this match, you know. I don't care about my level today, because the most important was to win. I did it. I'm in the final. That's it. Tomorrow I will play, you know, really relaxed, because I will play against Andy Murray. For the moment he's better than me, so I have nothing to lose. He's a fantastic player on grass court, so I will see tomorrow, but tomorrow I think I will play better, anyway.	3117_0.a	2011-06-11	M	3117	James Ward	Jo-Wilfried Tsonga	How would you rate your own performance out there this afternoon?	3117_0.q	19.0	1	Semifinals	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
3117_1	Not lose it, because -- anyway, I was confident. But of course, you know, sometimes you play and the ball don't go where you want, and the player in front of you play well, take his chance, and today he did it. I think he was a bit tired, so today was just good to win.	3117_1.a	2011-06-11	M	3117	James Ward	Jo-Wilfried Tsonga	How threatened did you feel towards the end of that second set? Was there any point where you thought that you might lose it?	3117_1.q	19.0	1	Semifinals	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
3117_2	No, today he didn't play his best tennis, of course. But the crowd was behind him, and he did everything to win. But I think he can play -- he can play better.	3117_2.a	2011-06-11	M	3117	James Ward	Jo-Wilfried Tsonga	How do you rate James Ward? Do you think he put in a good performance?	3117_2.q	19.0	1	Semifinals	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
3117_3	You know, I feel good because I know they like me. They like my game. So, you know, this is sports. Sometimes you play in a country, and you play against the countryman and the crowd is behind the other player. This is sports. I accept that. Of course I will play my best tennis. I will try to play my best tennis to win tomorrow, anyway.	3117_3.a	2011-06-11	M	3117	James Ward	Jo-Wilfried Tsonga	Obviously you had the crowd against you today. You will probably have the crowd against you again tomorrow because you'll be facing another British player. How do you feel about that?	3117_3.q	19.0	1	Semifinals	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
3117_4	Really excited, because it's the second final for me this year. I didn't play really well these last months, and I'm waiting for a title. So I will try tomorrow to get this one.	3117_4.a	2011-06-11	M	3117	James Ward	Jo-Wilfried Tsonga	How excited are you to be in the final here kind of ahead of Wimbledon?	3117_4.q	19.0	1	Semifinals	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
3117_5	About what?	3117_5.a	2011-06-11	M	3117	James Ward	Jo-Wilfried Tsonga	Can you tell us a little bit about your preparations for Wimbledon? After tomorrow, how will you go about preparing?	3117_5.q	19.0	1	Semifinals	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
3117_6	No, I will go to Eastbourne. I need to play. Last year I didn't play enough, and I need to play to improve my game and to feel confident, win some matches. Yeah.	3117_6.a	2011-06-11	M	3117	James Ward	Jo-Wilfried Tsonga	For your training for Wimbledon. Will you stay in London?	3117_6.q	19.0	1	Semifinals	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
3117_7	No, today I'm fit. I'm fit. I don't have any problems. I think this is the difference between me one year ago and me now. I feel I have no problem. I can jump on the court, I run, slide, can do everything. So I'm ready to play tennis.	3117_7.a	2011-06-11	M	3117	James Ward	Jo-Wilfried Tsonga	We know that through your career you have had a lot of problems with injuries. How are you at the moment? Are you fully fit? Have you any problems?	3117_7.q	19.0	1	Semifinals	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
3117_8	What it mean for me? First a Grand Slam, one of the majors, it's one of my favorite tournaments. The atmosphere in Wimbledon is just incredible, and I like this tournament. I like this surface. I like people here. I like the town. I like everything. Yeah.	3117_8.a	2011-06-11	M	3117	James Ward	Jo-Wilfried Tsonga	Can you explain the importance of Wimbledon for a French player who comes over straight after the French Open? What does it mean to you?	3117_8.q	19.0	1	Semifinals	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
3117_9	I hope me. (Smiling.) But I hope it will happen in the future, anyway, even if it's not me.	3117_9.a	2011-06-11	M	3117	James Ward	Jo-Wilfried Tsonga	If a French player was to break through and win Wimbledon, who would it be?	3117_9.q	19.0	1	Semifinals	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
3117_10	I'm still without a coach.	3117_10.a	2011-06-11	M	3117	James Ward	Jo-Wilfried Tsonga	Are you still without a coach?	3117_10.q	19.0	1	Semifinals	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
3117_11	Not really good. (Laughter.)	3117_11.a	2011-06-11	M	3117	James Ward	Jo-Wilfried Tsonga	How is that working out for you?	3117_11.q	19.0	1	Semifinals	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
3117_12	Not for the moment. For the moment I'm waiting. You know, I feel good like this. I improve my game. I have no reason to change. But anyway, when I will feel the -- how you say, necessary? The need. When I feel the need, I will try to find somebody, of course.	3117_12.a	2011-06-11	M	3117	James Ward	Jo-Wilfried Tsonga	Are you trying to find a coach then?	3117_12.q	19.0	1	Semifinals	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
3117_13	Yeah, I work with them a bit. But it's not something -- how you say that? They just give me some advice for the moment. But, yeah, for the moment that's it. Maybe after it will be more. I don't know.	3117_13.a	2011-06-11	M	3117	James Ward	Jo-Wilfried Tsonga	Andy works with the adidas coaching staff.	3117_13.q	19.0	1	Semifinals	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
3117_14	Not for the moment. I tell you I just -- they just give me some advice for the moment. We try to find a way to work a bit together maybe, but for the moment there is nothing sure, you know. But anyway, they are good coach. Yeah.	3117_14.a	2011-06-11	M	3117	James Ward	Jo-Wilfried Tsonga	Have you worked with Darren Cahill yet? Andy has benefited a lot.	3117_14.q	19.0	1	Semifinals	AEGON CHAMPIONSHIPS	ATP250
4568_0	Yeah, it's tough. You know, I mean, obviously in matches you kind of can build momentum and build leads, and then when you stop, once you come back out again, you feel like you're starting off from square one. But I did well today. He started the third set well. He had a few chances. I came up with some big serves. I served very well in the third set especially. But, yeah, it's never easy. There were, what, three, four, three stops or something. It's not easy.	4568_0.a	2012-07-03	M	4568	Marin Cilic	Andy Murray	How tough was that with the conditions and all the delays?	4568_0.q	4.0	1	4th Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4568_1	No, not at all. Not at all. Because I served a lot of aces, that's why the games were quick. I managed to get done. But, yeah, the weather had nothing to do. I would have played as fast or slow as I needed to do to win the match. I wasn't worried about the weather.	4568_1.a	2012-07-03	M	4568	Marin Cilic	Andy Murray	Was the weather a factor in the pace that you played that third set?	4568_1.q	4.0	1	4th Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4568_2	He's a clay court specialist? No, he's not. To me he's not a clay court specialist. He won last week on grass, so he's won, what, eight matches in a row on the grass. He's been in the semifinals of Australia, I think semifinals of US Open, as well, and now he's starting to play better on grass. I don't see him as a clay court specialist at all.	4568_2.a	2012-07-03	M	4568	Marin Cilic	Andy Murray	Even if Ferrer is a clay court specialist, how much do you think...	4568_2.q	4.0	1	4th Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4568_3	Yeah, I mean, for most players it helps with the serve. You know, the one thing that a lot of players can struggle with is the movement. That's the one thing that's normally the hardest part on the grass if you're used to playing on other surfaces. I saw a bit of his match with Roddick a few days ago. He seems like he's moving, you know, better than in the past. This year he's playing his best tennis I think of his career. I don't know if he would say the same thing, but from playing against him and watching, he's playing very well.	4568_3.a	2012-07-03	M	4568	Marin Cilic	Andy Murray	How much do you think the grass helps his game, especially his first serve which is maybe not the best weapon?	4568_3.q	4.0	1	4th Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4568_4	No, I think for both of us the return's probably one of the stronger part of our games. I mean, the speed of my first serve is probably a bit bigger than his. But in all matches going on the grass courts, you want to try and win free points from your serve if possible. If I serve like I did in the end of the second set and the third set today, I mean, it doesn't matter how well someone's returning. Because if you hit a serve close to the line on grass, you can't get there.	4568_4.a	2012-07-03	M	4568	Marin Cilic	Andy Murray	The way you're serving at the moment, do you feel you could be in a better position against him knowing what he's going to be trying to do?	4568_4.q	4.0	1	4th Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4568_5	I don't think it was my match. It wouldn't have made sense to move my match. I thought maybe the Mayer/Gasquet match to try and finish all the matches from the top half possibly. But I don't know, you never know. I don't know in terms of when the matches obviously the match the other night when I played finished at 11:00. I don't know if there were concerns over that or not because they were pretty early on in their match when they finished yesterday. But that would have been the only match that I thought might have made sense.	4568_5.a	2012-07-03	M	4568	Marin Cilic	Andy Murray	You talk about the momentum being lost when you had to stop last night and come back today. What were your thoughts on the fact that no matches were moved to Centre Court last night?	4568_5.q	4.0	1	4th Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4568_6	The schedule was done, I mean, almost like 15 minutes 15, 20 minutes after I came off against Marcos. I came out of the shower and I was told, You're playing second on Court1. I mean, I had no idea what the weather was meant to be like or anything at that moment. So wasn't surprised. But it was going to be tough for whoever had to play on the outside courts, because obviously the conditions were meant to be bad yesterday, today, and I think even tomorrow.	4568_6.a	2012-07-03	M	4568	Marin Cilic	Andy Murray	Were you surprised when you found you were put on Court1 originally? Did that bother you?	4568_6.q	4.0	1	4th Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4568_7	It's not just me. There's lots of guys in exactly the same position. Anyone will tell you if you play four matches in eight days, it's better than playing four matches in five or six days. The more rest you can get the better, but it's part of playing Grand Slam tennis. Often it's happened to me in the past at the US Open where there's been like a backlog of matches. It's not going to be the only time it happens here either.	4568_7.a	2012-07-03	M	4568	Marin Cilic	Andy Murray	Yesterday there was a prospect of you potentially playing three games in four days. Is that a disadvantage?	4568_7.q	4.0	1	4th Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4568_8	Well, we'll see whether or not it's an advantage for him or not. But the more rest you can get, the better. Anyone would tell you that.	4568_8.a	2012-07-03	M	4568	Marin Cilic	Andy Murray	Obviously not for Novak, because he's going to be playing under the roof if he is on Centre Court irrespective of the rain. Is that going to provide an advantage to a defending champion?	4568_8.q	4.0	1	4th Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4568_9	Yes, it's important. I served well on first and second serve. Yeah, something I'll need to keep up 'cause, you know, the more points you're winning on your second serve, the more confident you are to go for big first serves. So, yeah, I'll try and keep serving that way.	4568_9.a	2012-07-03	M	4568	Marin Cilic	Andy Murray	You've won a higher percentage of points on your second serve than anyone else in the tournament. Is that something you've been particularly happy with, and how important can that be?	4568_9.q	4.0	1	4th Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4568_10	I'm sure it would mean a lot. Yeah, I can't put into words or describe how it would feel because I haven't felt it before. But, I mean, it's so far away. I'm sure, you know, you get that, I don't know, that feeling or what the sensations that you get are when it's close to winning a major. But I'm not feeling that right now because I'm playing against the No.5 player in the world in my next match, and I lost against him a few weeks ago at the French Open. It's so far to think about it just now. I've thought about it in the past, but during this tournament it's not something I've been thinking about.	4568_10.a	2012-07-03	M	4568	Marin Cilic	Andy Murray	After all these thousands of hours of practice, breakthroughs, setbacks, what would it mean for you to lift the trophy on Sunday?	4568_10.q	4.0	1	4th Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4568_11	No, because, I mean, sometimes I played him when it's been windy and I played better than him; sometimes it's been windy and he's played better than me. Sometimes we played indoors and he's played very well, and vice versa. Yeah, it's not something well, I don't know. If I had to pick which courts to play him on, I'd rather not play him on a clay court because it's a surface that I struggled against him on. But on the other surfaces I've played some good matches against him. Tough matches, but good. Won against him a few times. Hopefully I can do the same tomorrow.	4568_11.a	2012-07-03	M	4568	Marin Cilic	Andy Murray	It's not up to you to choose if you will play under the roof or not. It depends on God. But if you had to play Ferrer, and he has certain characteristics  moving, the wind maybe bothers him or you more  where would you prefer to play, under the roof, outside, normal weather? Do you have any sort of preference?	4568_11.q	4.0	1	4th Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4568_12	I mean, the other day when I played Baghdatis it was very, very windy. It was very tough conditions. You didn't feel that comfortable really going for your shots because the wind was, you know, affecting it a lot. And then when you play under the roof, it's obviously, yeah, completely calm. It's probably easier to serve. When you're under the roof there's no sun or wind affecting your ball toss or anything. But, yeah, playing indoor tennis is always like that. Yeah, it's easier conditions to strike the ball better.	4568_12.a	2012-07-03	M	4568	Marin Cilic	Andy Murray	Following up about the action under the roof, what do you consider the biggest differences and what do you like and dislike the most about playing indoors here under the roof?	4568_12.q	4.0	1	4th Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4568_13	I've always enjoyed playing indoors, but I never played that many matches on indoor grass courts. I hadn't play my best matches. When I had gone indoors I'd struggled a little bit here in the past when I had had to play under the roof. But I played better against Baghdatis under the roof than I did than when it was open.	4568_13.a	2012-07-03	M	4568	Marin Cilic	Andy Murray	In terms of what you like and dislike most, what would you say?	4568_13.q	4.0	1	4th Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4568_14	We'll see tomorrow whether it has relevance or not. Tennis changes on a weekly basis. Some guys play great one week and struggle the next. You know, like last year I think Novak had never beaten Rafa in a final, and then he wins, whatever, six or seven in a row against him. You never know. So I just need to make sure I play well tomorrow and see what the outcome is.	4568_14.a	2012-07-03	M	4568	Marin Cilic	Andy Murray	The match you played against Ferrer at the French Open, do you think that has any relevance or not?	4568_14.q	4.0	1	4th Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4568_15	I don't think you should get preferential treatment. You know, obviously, I mean, all of the players would say they would rather play on Centre because they know they're going to finish their match. I don't deserve to play all my matches on Centre Court. Someone like Roger does. It's not a bad thing playing on the outside court. It's just when the conditions are bad it's not ideal to be out there because matches can last for two, three days, and then you get a backlog. But, I mean, I don't think just because you're from that country you should necessarily get preferential treatment, but I hope that I play my next few matches on Centre.	4568_15.a	2012-07-03	M	4568	Marin Cilic	Andy Murray	Where do you stand on the argument whether you're the biggest hope the host nation has? Do you feel you should get preferential treatment in terms of scheduling?	4568_15.q	4.0	1	4th Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4568_16	Yeah, it's not easy, because sometimes you come out and you feel a little bit nervous. Sometimes you come out and I think maybe it's sometimes better to be receiving serve. You can maybe have the game to get used to the conditions. There's a bit less pressure than when you come out serving. Yeah, I mean, I listen to music in the break. This time yesterday I finished, went home, played on the PlayStation with one of my friends for an hour or so. You just try not to always be focusing on the match, because when you do, that sort of builds that tension. When you go out there, you can struggle. This time I did a pretty good job in the rain delay because that hasn't always been the case.	4568_16.a	2012-07-03	M	4568	Marin Cilic	Andy Murray	You're a laid back person. How do you manage to keep up the tempo? How do you relax when those delays are taking place?	4568_16.q	4.0	1	4th Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
616_0	I've just had a little bit of a sinus infection the last couple weeks. It's getting to the end stages of it. But it's still affecting me a little bit. It's going to go away eventually. But it is, it's pretty annoying at the start of matches. Started getting blurry vision. I thought I dug out the first set well. Obviously lifted my energy towards the second and third.	616_0.a	2015-07-01	M	616	Juan Monaco	Nick Kyrgios	How do you assess that? Looked a little bit flat early. Heard talk about a headache. Were you ill out there at all?	616_0.q	29.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
616_1	Yeah, definitely. He's capable of playing some pretty good tennis. He's been in the third round here a couple times. I was really surprised. He was hitting pretty big, pretty flat. I thought to beat him in straight sets is a pretty good performance. I thought I served real well today. My energy was really good, as well.	616_1.a	2015-07-01	M	616	Juan Monaco	Nick Kyrgios	He's a former top20 player. Doing it in three sets, must be pleased the way you're going?	616_1.q	29.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
616_2	Yeah, I'm excited. Obviously to play a guy like that, he's pretty much at the top of the game. After last year's performance against him, I'm confident I can do well. But at the same time, if a guy is serving as well as he is, it's going to be tough. I know what I have to do out there. But at the same time, there's not so much you can do on his serve.	616_2.a	2015-07-01	M	616	Juan Monaco	Nick Kyrgios	Raonic next. How is that considering what happened here last year?	616_2.q	29.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
616_3	Yeah, that's massive. I think, if they're behind you, pushing you, you just have to dig in and fight through. I thought I did that well in the first set. If he would have won that first set, it could have been a completely different match out there. I think that first set was a massive part of that match.	616_3.a	2015-07-01	M	616	Juan Monaco	Nick Kyrgios	When you have a physical issue you're dealing with, what effect does the fan base have for you?	616_3.q	29.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
616_4	It was tough, obviously, emotionally. I didn't get much sleep the night leading up to the Rafa match or after. I thought I backed it up pretty well. I lost to Milos in a tight fourset match. I had chances to win that. I had a break in the third. I can take confidence out of that. I feel I'm a much better athlete than what I was last year.	616_4.a	2015-07-01	M	616	Juan Monaco	Nick Kyrgios	How bad was it coming back after beating Nadal and playing against Raonic?	616_4.q	29.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
616_5	I can't even remember saying that.	616_5.a	2015-07-01	M	616	Juan Monaco	Nick Kyrgios	There was a moment in the first set that you told the Fanatics it was not the best time to be singing. Does that distract you, the noise?	616_5.q	29.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
616_6	I don't know.	616_6.a	2015-07-01	M	616	Juan Monaco	Nick Kyrgios	Right at the end.	616_6.q	29.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
616_7	I don't know what he said. I was just asking the umpire what the line judge said. I was just curious. I wasn't causing any drama there.	616_7.a	2015-07-01	M	616	Juan Monaco	Nick Kyrgios	What happened with the linesman? What was said to the umpire at the end of the first set?	616_7.q	29.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
616_8	That's where I feel as I've drawn a lot of confidence. You know, today I didn't feel my body aching or anything at all, in my legs. That's a lot of confidence. I thought last year against Raonic, I gave absolutely everything I could. I lost 76 in the fourth set. If it was going to a fifth, I feel I could have completely emptied the tank. I feel like I'm a lot more confident coming into it.	616_8.a	2015-07-01	M	616	Juan Monaco	Nick Kyrgios	Last year against Raonic you said you ran out of petrol basically at the end. Your endurance these days, how do you feel about that?	616_8.q	29.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
616_9	I mean, playing standpoint, it speeds up the play a little bit. Yeah, I mean, it was pretty hot out there today. Bernard, he said he struggled a little bit with that. I thought I ticked all the boxes well. Ate a lot on the court, bananas, drunk, ice, towel, all that sort of stuff. So I thought I did well.	616_9.a	2015-07-01	M	616	Juan Monaco	Nick Kyrgios	Much talk about the heat today. What sort of effects did you find from that?	616_9.q	29.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
616_10	What's the question?	616_10.a	2015-07-01	M	616	Juan Monaco	Nick Kyrgios	Are you aware you're swearing quite loudly, and that's what makes the line judge talk to the umpire, or are you not realizing it?	616_10.q	29.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
616_11	Yeah, I guess, yeah. I'm aware of what I'm saying. I'm in pain and I'm playing a tennis match at Wimbledon second round. A bit of stress out there.	616_11.a	2015-07-01	M	616	Juan Monaco	Nick Kyrgios	Are you aware of sort of what you're saying and how loudly you're swearing, given I think that's what prompted the line judge to go to the umpire and say, Say to him you just said this.	616_11.q	29.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
616_12	I guess that's why he did it.	616_12.a	2015-07-01	M	616	Juan Monaco	Nick Kyrgios	I'm saying the reason...	616_12.q	29.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
616_13	He sort of said I don't know. I just thought he thought he was top dog in the chair really. He was telling me not to speak to him, all that stuff. Doesn't really matter, you know.	616_13.a	2015-07-01	M	616	Juan Monaco	Nick Kyrgios	What did the chair umpire say to you?	616_13.q	29.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
616_14	Yeah, he's improved a lot from the back. Feel he's putting a lot more pressure on the people's serve. He's getting a lot more points. I think he's moving a lot better. He's just finding more confidence from the ground. He's improved a lot, as well. But, I mean, that serve, I think it's possibly the best in the game at the moment.	616_14.a	2015-07-01	M	616	Juan Monaco	Nick Kyrgios	Apart from the serve with Milos, what's the most difficult part of his game? Is it return?	616_14.q	29.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
616_15	Obviously I've got to look after my serve. I don't want him breaking me too many times. I have to try to keep creating pressure on his serve. Do whatever I can, scrape out points. Stay competing the whole time, from the first ball to the last.	616_15.a	2015-07-01	M	616	Juan Monaco	Nick Kyrgios	You said you knew what you have to do against him. What is that?	616_15.q	29.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3003_0	Disappointed. You know, it's too bad I wasn't able to come up with, you know, my best at the important time in the match. She did. She was very consistent, didn't give me any easy mistakes. I gave her a few too many. So, yeah.	3003_0.a	2010-06-29	F	3003	Vera Zvonareva	Kim Clijsters	Are you as stunned as we are?	3003_0.q	8.0	0	Quarterfinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3003_1	No, no. Physically, I mean, I feel fine. Foot, everything feels fine. Like I said, I just didn't, yeah, produce on the important points in the match. You know, a couple times, uhm, had some chances just to get back into it, to break back. I think I was Love-30 up. You know, she served very well at the important points. But I never really, uhm, yeah, made her work for it all that much. I think, obviously, that's probably the most disappointing thing for me.	3003_1.a	2010-06-29	F	3003	Vera Zvonareva	Kim Clijsters	She obviously played well down the stretch. Did you feel like you were running out of gas? Didn't recover well from yesterday?	3003_1.q	8.0	0	Quarterfinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3003_2	I think she was good at keeping me under pressure. She hits the ball very hard, flat and deep. It was up to me to try to go for the lines, open up the court a little bit more, especially to her forehand. I was trying to pull her out of the court a little bit. But, yeah, she was really on top of my game I felt today. I mean, her backhand is her stronger shot. I mean, it's very hard to read the shot. Especially when she goes down the line, it's like a last-second. You can't even read it. I was kind of always on my toes, yeah, obviously trying to go to the forehand a little bit more. But it's not easy when the balls are coming from the cross-court down the line. With the backhand I was trying to go down the line before she would. But, yeah, I mean, I was trying to, like I said, go for the lines. But it's not easy when they're coming that hard and deep.	3003_2.a	2010-06-29	F	3003	Vera Zvonareva	Kim Clijsters	You talked about the adjustments you made against Henin. Were they not there today?	3003_2.q	8.0	0	Quarterfinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3003_3	I think I'm more focused than I used to be. You know, it takes time. This is my first time back at Wimbledon. I haven't been back for a year yet. Obviously it takes time. You know, obviously not being able to play the second Grand Slam of the year, you know, the Grand Slams is what you want to aim for. I would have liked to have done better here. It was disappointing to come from, you know, five, six weeks off without hitting one ball. That was probably also not a great preparation. But I'm not blaming that at all. You know, I've played really well since I've come back. I played two good matches in Eastbourne. I played some good tennis here. So, you know, I don't think that's anything to blame. That's my choice, too. On one hand, I'm the one who's deciding whether I want to play 24 tournaments a year or 16. That's totally my choice if I'm not injured.	3003_3.a	2010-06-29	F	3003	Vera Zvonareva	Kim Clijsters	You've had some great success since your comeback. You've been also somewhat unpredictable. Do you think it has something to do with you took a break, your life is enriched, it's not as important to focus?	3003_3.q	8.0	0	Quarterfinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3003_4	Uhm, I mean, obviously I haven't seen all of them play, but obviously they can hit the ball well. You don't get to a quarter or a semifinal by luck. So they can obviously hit the ball hard. That's something that -- you know, obviously that question has been asked to me since I've come back, to see how the game has changed. I've said it many times before: I really feel there's a lot of girls out there who can make it the top players really hard, maybe just not on a consistent basis. I think that's what we're seeing here as well. It's good to see new names doing well, to see them doing well at the Grand Slams. These are all girls who have beaten a lot of good players in the past, but probably not in the spotlight when all the media is around to see it.	3003_4.a	2010-06-29	F	3003	Vera Zvonareva	Kim Clijsters	In a bigger picture, Wozniacki, the last teenager, went out yesterday. A lot of names who really aren't that familiar are going really deep into this tournament. Could you talk about that.	3003_4.q	8.0	0	Quarterfinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3003_5	That doesn't bother me at all. I mean, I think, you know, pressure, you know, being looked at as a favorite or something, I mean, it's a compliment. It's a sign of you doing well, so I see it as a compliment.	3003_5.a	2010-06-29	F	3003	Vera Zvonareva	Kim Clijsters	Do we expect too much of you after the US Open?	3003_5.q	8.0	0	Quarterfinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3003_6	Uhm, I mean, it's hard to think about that right now, to answer that question now, because I haven't thought about that. But obviously, you know, if I wouldn't have been injured, I would have played two, three tournaments more leading into Wimbledon, maybe four. So, you know, I mean, I was here with the preparation that I had, and I tried to make the best of it. You know, I showed some really good stuff yesterday, even in the first set today. Like I said, I just wasn't quite there at the important points; at the US Open I was. So, you know, it's not that I had that many matches going into the Open, so I don't know if looking for the reason why I lost is the right one.	3003_6.a	2010-06-29	F	3003	Vera Zvonareva	Kim Clijsters	Is any of this a function of match readiness? Would you think about playing more tournaments as the season goes on?	3003_6.q	8.0	0	Quarterfinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3003_7	Obviously what I always want to work on is my serve, and, you know, making sure that I get a higher first-serve percentage. But when you play girls who hit the ball hard, and especially women's tennis these days, everybody hits the ball hard and flat and deep. I think I have the habit of probably not finishing my service motion to a full end because as soon as I land with my first foot, I'm already pushing back to be ready for that next shot. So you have to make a choice. You want to be ready, you know, maybe a little bit later for the next shot because you want to have a higher percentage of serve. I'm really trying to work on that. Obviously, you know, in practice it's going well. In matches, it's your habits that come back at the most important moments in the match.	3003_7.a	2010-06-29	F	3003	Vera Zvonareva	Kim Clijsters	What are the biggest things you think you need to work on between now and the Open?	3003_7.q	8.0	0	Quarterfinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3003_8	I mean, I have to say, the situation that we were in here at Wimbledon was very similar to the way we are at home. Obviously we have our family around. So we probably spend a little bit more time, you know, going to visit family and everything. Obviously taking care of the dogs and all that stuff. That's something that I love, as well. So, yeah, that's probably what we'll do. Then we have the event, the Best of Belgium event. Then we'll go to the States and spend some time with the American family side.	3003_8.a	2010-06-29	F	3003	Vera Zvonareva	Kim Clijsters	When you return home, do you go to sort of a domestic mindset and work around the house? Could you talk about what your life is like when you're not in the midst of a huge tournament back at home.	3003_8.q	8.0	0	Quarterfinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3003_9	I think we also want to show our best. I think we're obligated in a way to show the people, you know, our best tennis. I think, you know, it's not a matter of who wins or loses there; it's a celebration of not just Justine and myself, but I think the past of Belgium sports and musicians and everything. I really look forward to it just because I think we've broken the record with all the attendance that we have. So it's going to be an amazing night.	3003_9.a	2010-06-29	F	3003	Vera Zvonareva	Kim Clijsters	How competitive will the Best of Belgium match be? It's an exhibition. Exhibitions very often are played for fun, so everybody has a good time. It implies there's kind of a serious confrontation.	3003_9.q	8.0	0	Quarterfinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3003_10	I don't know. To be honest, I haven't really thought about that yet.	3003_10.a	2010-06-29	F	3003	Vera Zvonareva	Kim Clijsters	Do you go out playing as if it's a fourth round of Wimbledon?	3003_10.q	8.0	0	Quarterfinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
571_0	Well, I just feel much better than in the beginning of the year. And also, I think the surface also makes a huge difference. Everything is just easier for me. I already have bad times right now, a few months ago.	571_0.a	2015-07-04	F	571	Casey Dellacqua	Agnieszka Radwanska	Just talk about you're playing great again and why?	571_0.q	13.0	1	3rd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
571_1	Yeah, well, of course losing first round is always disappointing. I wasn't happy at all. Well, I have some days off. Well, that was a lot of actually time that I had. That's why I also took the wild card to Nottingham, to play some more matches. Especially the grass season was a little bit longer this year. And, you know, I think more matches also give me more confidence. And, you know, I was feeling good from the beginning. That's why I just keep going in Eastbourne. I had a lot of good matches against top players.	571_1.a	2015-07-04	F	571	Casey Dellacqua	Agnieszka Radwanska	I remember talking about it at Roland Garros when you lost early, you seemed to be upset. But then you left Roland Garros and you came to England and all of a sudden you changed. What happened there?	571_1.q	13.0	1	3rd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
571_2	Well, when I was practicing, everything was okay. I just couldn't do the same things during the matches, and that was it. That's why I just needed more matches. I think I just needed those couple of months to work on that, and I think that works very well.	571_2.a	2015-07-04	F	571	Casey Dellacqua	Agnieszka Radwanska	Did you tell yourself something different when you got home and you were having problems? Did you say, I need to do something different?	571_2.q	13.0	1	3rd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
571_3	Well, I didn't change anything much. I think right now the tennis, it's very on a high level, that every match is really tight. When you have everything 100%, everything is turning against you. And you are losing first tournament and then the second one. Then it's just keep going the wrong way. That's why I just turned it around these things just few weeks ago. Now everything is in a good way.	571_3.a	2015-07-04	F	571	Casey Dellacqua	Agnieszka Radwanska	So do you feel like you're doing a little bit different? Looks almost the same, but you have always been very smart anyways on the court, whether you're creative or all of that?	571_3.q	13.0	1	3rd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
571_4	Yeah, I think so, of course.	571_4.a	2015-07-04	F	571	Casey Dellacqua	Agnieszka Radwanska	So is the confidence all there now?	571_4.q	13.0	1	3rd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
571_5	Oh, after last week, for sure. That was really big and strong tournament. A lot of players in it. There were no easy matches. I was really happy just to have more grass court matches there. I was playing really well. Of course that was a good week for me.	571_5.a	2015-07-04	F	571	Casey Dellacqua	Agnieszka Radwanska	That was after last week or just this week here?	571_5.q	13.0	1	3rd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
571_6	Well, I think in that match I have nothing to lose. I'm playing twotime champion here, and I'm in the second week. Of course now I'm playing someone from the top. I think I'm just going to go on court and really play my best tennis. I really have nothing to lose right now, and I just hope I can play my best level.	571_6.a	2015-07-04	F	571	Casey Dellacqua	Agnieszka Radwanska	You might have to play Petra who has been playing well. You know her extremely well. Talk about that. Maybe on grass, maybe in front.	571_6.q	13.0	1	3rd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
571_7	Well, the last time we played was in Singapore. Totally different surface and conditions, so for sure that would be a different story here. But still, of course, it's even the match that I can win. Well, we'll see. We will see Monday.	571_7.a	2015-07-04	F	571	Casey Dellacqua	Agnieszka Radwanska	But you must feel like if you're playing great, you can beat her, anyways?	571_7.q	13.0	1	3rd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
4061_0	Yeah, I mean, it was better than Sydney. Yeah, it's still tough. It's only my fifth match of the year. Last four months of last year I didn't even play. So, yeah, it's still a work in progress. It will still take some time. It's not going to be easy just to come out at a Grand Slam and play a top10 player and perform the way that you want to perform. It will still take some time. I'm happy with the improvement that I'm making. I just need to keep on working and play as many matches as I can.	4061_0.a	2012-01-19	F	4061	Marion Bartoli	Jelena Dokic	Must be a little frustrating. Feel like you take a couple of steps forward and then a couple steps back. How did you see it?	4061_0.q	64.0	0	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4061_1	Yeah, I mean, it's a different time now. Yeah, you've got to move forward. Yeah, I mean, but I like to play here. Yeah, you know, unfortunately I'm not in that form, as I was then. Even 2009, coming into the tournament, I had a lot of matches. I had around 20 or 30 matches. So it's a little bit different. Yeah, just got to go on. Got to move on and go to the next tournament and keep on working. Right now, you know, I just need to play matches and play as many tournaments as I can in a row, just try to get the hang of playing matches again, which is something that I'm missing. I'm still not playing in matches as well as I would like to and as well as I am in practice, so...	4061_1.a	2012-01-19	F	4061	Marion Bartoli	Jelena Dokic	I suppose you didn't shake off that 2009 quarterfinal?	4061_1.q	64.0	0	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4061_2	Yeah, of course you can. I mean, it's not the end of the world. At the end of the day, it's just a tennis match. Yeah, but even saying that, you have to move on. It's done. You look forward to tomorrow. Just every day you've got to work towards improving something and getting better and better and better and it will come. Yeah, it's never easy to take a loss. It's always hard. You're disappointed. But, you know, for me it doesn't take that long and I move on. You have to think about your next tournament.	4061_2.a	2012-01-19	F	4061	Marion Bartoli	Jelena Dokic	The other day when you were in here you talked about staying positive, chilling out. Can you still stay positive after tonight?	4061_2.q	64.0	0	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4061_3	Not as much as Sydney. You just want to play well and perform well here, especially on Rod Laver. It's always going to be a factor, especially if you're not feeling like so confident and haven't had as many matches. Of course, it's always going to creep in a little bit. But, yeah, it's okay. It's done now. It's over. I'm going to look forward. I'm looking forward to whatever's next on my schedule.	4061_3.a	2012-01-19	F	4061	Marion Bartoli	Jelena Dokic	The nerves weren't a factor at all for you?	4061_3.q	64.0	0	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4061_4	I'm going back to Europe for a little bit. Then I don't know. Fed Cup, I haven't heard anything. Yeah, then all the tournaments after that. If I get into Paris and a couple other ones after that.	4061_4.a	2012-01-19	F	4061	Marion Bartoli	Jelena Dokic	Where are you heading off to next?	4061_4.q	64.0	0	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4061_5	Probably my serve, because it was pretty hard to play not even so much my second serve or doublefaults but my first serve, because it was such a low percentage. I was kind of on the back foot not being able to get a lot of first serves in. It put a lot of pressure on my serve. Then, of course, it was a lot harder to break her, because she did have a couple of easy games. She served well when she needed to, which is something that I didn't do. That's kind of where it started. Yeah, just my firstserve percentage because then when I wasn't able to get that first serve in, it put a lot of pressure on my second serve, and that's when I did a couple doublefaults. I just wasn't really putting those first serves in.	4061_5.a	2012-01-19	F	4061	Marion Bartoli	Jelena Dokic	What do you feel let you down tonight?	4061_5.q	64.0	0	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4061_6	First came when?	4061_6.a	2012-01-19	F	4061	Marion Bartoli	Jelena Dokic	Off the topic of tonight's match, how much did tennis play a role in helping you find your place as an Australian when you first came?	4061_6.q	64.0	0	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4061_7	Well, I mean, I came as a 10yearold, so I don't know how much you know then. Or 9yearold. It's a little bit difficult to, yeah, comment on that because I was so little.	4061_7.a	2012-01-19	F	4061	Marion Bartoli	Jelena Dokic	First came to Australia.	4061_7.q	64.0	0	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4061_8	Yeah, but I don't feel Australian because I play tennis here. You know, I feel Australian because I grew up here and I lived here. Yeah, I don't think tennis alone has anything to do with it. Yeah, I think, you know, even if I wasn't playing tennis, I don't mean when I was really little, but later on when I came back to Australia, would have came back. Tennis necessarily doesn't have anything to do with being Australian. I mean, I'm proud to be Australian. Just because I'm in the sport and it's so high profile, it gets a lot of attention. But, yeah, I mean, look, I love Australia. I grew up here. I love to play for Australia, so...	4061_8.a	2012-01-19	F	4061	Marion Bartoli	Jelena Dokic	But later on when you started playing, turned professional, was that a major factor in feeling at home here in Australia?	4061_8.q	64.0	0	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4061_9	Well, look, I haven't been involved in any one of those matches, so I don't know how loud it gets or anything. But, look, every country's out here supporting their players. That's normal. Australians get very loud. Also especially on those outside courts, like the Margaret Court Arena, which I've played on last year and this year. Also the Greeks have always been really, really loud. So that's special, that's different. But, yeah, look, at the end of the day it's a sport. Everybody supports the players they love to watch, especially when they play for their country. Especially if you only have one or two players representing, like a lot of the countries do... I think it's great. It's fantastic for the sport.	4061_9.a	2012-01-19	F	4061	Marion Bartoli	Jelena Dokic	Do you have any sort of feelings towards the way some of the Greek supporters and Serbian supporters get a little overenthusiastic during the tennis?	4061_9.q	64.0	0	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3231_0	Happy with how things went today. Again, I was able to take care of my serve, like my last match, and I was able to use my opportunities on his. Just got a bit tight there towards the end, but pulled it back together the next game and played a good tiebreak. So I'm happy with that.	3231_0.a	2011-01-20	M	3231	nan	Milos Raonic	You were really calm, cool, played a good match.	3231_0.q	152.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3231_1	Yeah. I didn't ask too much, but people have been saying it to me. But I was happy I got around that. I was ready no matter what the situation is to keep playing, if I had to, if things went south. But I feel like I played two good tiebreaks. I don't think I lost any points on my serve. Not much I can really complain about there. I'm taking care of my points and using my opportunities.	3231_1.a	2011-01-20	M	3231	nan	Milos Raonic	Have you been told that that ball was on the line that you thought was on the line?	3231_1.q	152.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3231_2	I feel like lately I've been working a lot on my serve. And I think a lot of pressure is taken off my serve because of my second shot, I'm playing well with it, dictating a lot. Because always I was getting a lot of block returns. Maybe I would get tight or not play the first ball after as aggressively and effectively. Now I'm taking care of that, so that's taking even more pressure off my serve. So this is letting me relax more.	3231_2.a	2011-01-20	M	3231	nan	Milos Raonic	Have you served better than that very often?	3231_2.q	152.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3231_3	As far as playing on a specific day, I wouldn't say so. But as far as in a tournament, this is my biggest result. It's my biggest achievement to date. But I hope to do more than this. I feel like I can. I feel like I'm playing at a level that I'm still there and I'm there with the top guys. I look forward to the next match and I look forward to imposing my game.	3231_3.a	2011-01-20	M	3231	nan	Milos Raonic	Three wins in qualifying, then two in the main draw. Is this the best form of your career?	3231_3.q	152.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3231_4	Before I came here, obviously I wasn't thinking this far ahead. But going day into day, seeing how stuff progressed, how I was playing better after the first week of the year, it's not really a surprise. But before this trip, yeah, it is.	3231_4.a	2011-01-20	M	3231	nan	Milos Raonic	Has this exceeded your expectations, what's happened so far?	3231_4.q	152.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3231_5	It's really not the stakes I'm too worried about right now. I'm not thinking about that too much. I'm thinking about really working my way up the ladder. Improving my level is a big thing for me, making sure I'm playing the game, making sure I'm playing well week in, week out. I feel like I'm doing that better now than I have ever before. So I'm happy with my progress. As long as I keep developing in the right way, I feel the results will come. So I'm really not stressing too much about it. But I'm going to go out there and fight for every point.	3231_5.a	2011-01-20	M	3231	nan	Milos Raonic	How are you going to keep up the momentum as the stakes rise?	3231_5.q	152.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3231_6	I've always known what I can do. It's just been about implying it and using my game, imposing my weapons on my opponents. And obviously it's brought on a new confidence to me, so this comes easier, believing in myself more. This comes with winning matches. I'm able to do that more effectively right now than I have ever before.	3231_6.a	2011-01-20	M	3231	nan	Milos Raonic	Having had those three qualifiers and these two matches, get a bit of rhythm, do you feel like you're learning more about yourself, what you can do against those good guys?	3231_6.q	152.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3231_7	I was a big fan of him. I followed throughout his career, most of his career. He grew up during my idol Sampras, whose matches I would tape and watch all the time, many times, one match. That's a really good comparison to have.	3231_7.a	2011-01-20	M	3231	nan	Milos Raonic	We don't know a lot about you in Australia. You've been compared to Mark Philippoussis. Do you know him at all?	3231_7.q	152.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3231_8	No, not yet. Maybe after tennis (smiling).	3231_8.a	2011-01-20	M	3231	nan	Milos Raonic	No plans for a reality dating show?	3231_8.q	152.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3231_9	That's actually big, because always I want to be able to give back. With the state of Canadian tennis, I feel like there's a lot I can give to that. This is, I'm hoping, going to have a big effect on it. My presence and my voice will have more of a say, I feel, within the Canadian tennis. I hope to help the sport grow, so this isn't a big deal for us. We want this to be four times a year in each of the Grand Slams, we want to have this consistent level.	3231_9.a	2011-01-20	M	3231	nan	Milos Raonic	What do you feel like this means for Canadian tennis?	3231_9.q	152.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3231_10	I was very fortunate last year. It's a fortunate situation, not unfortunate, that I got hurt at the end of the year. I tore my pec. But this allowed me to start up the off-season on November 15th. So this gave me six weeks of very tough fitness. It's really paying off here. It's helping out. I'm really feeling no stress, no fatigue in my body. I'm feeling fresh day in and day out. I'm obviously doing the things I have to to recover: taking care of my body, making sure I don't get hurt. But I feel I did put in the hours this off-season that are shining right now in my game and in my fitness, so...	3231_10.a	2011-01-20	M	3231	nan	Milos Raonic	How are you feeling physically after five matches? It was quite warm today. Your opponent looked like he was feeling it fairly early on. You're even a bigger guy than he is. How did you feel? How did the heat affect you?	3231_10.q	152.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3231_11	I wouldn't say it was more the pressure. I just had a different outlook on the match. As soon as I lost my serve at the beginning of the match, I started panicking right away. I wasn't really happy with that. First week of the year, in Chennai, I lost last round quallies 7-6 in the third, not playing a good match, but also panicking. But what I've been being told by my coach, It doesn't matter how bad you play, as long as you win, you'll have another chance to get better and another chance. I won that match on that day, and I've had two chances and I'm playing better and better by the day and I look forward to my next match.	3231_11.a	2011-01-20	M	3231	nan	Milos Raonic	When you compare this match to the last one and maybe the next one, are you more relaxed playing these matches than you were playing that last match in the qualifying?	3231_11.q	152.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3231_12	I didn't know I hit 230. What is it...	3231_12.a	2011-01-20	M	3231	nan	Milos Raonic	And the 230, how many faster serves than that have you hit?	3231_12.q	152.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3231_13	That's interesting. I'll look where it puts me on the leaderboard.	3231_13.a	2011-01-20	M	3231	nan	Milos Raonic	142, I think, roughly.	3231_13.q	152.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3231_14	I don't know. I don't think I could hit much harder than that. I do resort to sometimes going for that because I know I have a good shoulder on me. So it is a weapon of mine, so I use it when I can. I tried not to get too carried away with the numbers, that aspect, because I feel like I can move the ball around the service box quite well.	3231_14.a	2011-01-20	M	3231	nan	Milos Raonic	Stupid question, but how hard do you think you could hit one?	3231_14.q	152.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3231_15	He's going to fight for every point and so am I. We're going to get out there. It's going to be a good match. I'm going to try the same: impose my game, try to dictate play more, try to go for my chances, really not have any regrets after my match. I know if I do this, everything's going to come together. We'll see what happens.	3231_15.a	2011-01-20	M	3231	nan	Milos Raonic	If it is Youzhny, any thoughts about possibly playing him?	3231_15.q	152.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3231_16	It's something new that comes with everything, with the results, so forth. I hope it's not just a one-time experience. I hope many more times. I try not to get carried away with these quirks and perks. But it's nice to have. It's nice to have this recognition. But I've put in the hours. I know that I deserve the moments I'm getting right now and the moments I'm fighting for.	3231_16.a	2011-01-20	M	3231	nan	Milos Raonic	What is the experience like of sitting in the same chair as Federer and Nadal in the interview room at the Australian Open?	3231_16.q	152.0	1	2nd Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4940_0	It was very tough match. She played very well from the first point until the last one. I didn't know her before, but I'm sure she's a future player because she plays and hits the ball so deep and so hard, moving very well. So I was just try to finding my way in my game from, yeah, at the beginning. I was not very, yeah, very good on foot, so I was not very moving very well. But I was just try to fighting until the last point, and she starts very well at the third set. It was 14 after five minutes. But, yeah, my coach is coming to me and just said, Just go out and try to play your game and find your aggressive game and just fight until the last point. Doesn't matter what's happen. I just try to, and of course I had a lot of confidence right now that I won again very close match like this. But, yeah, now I'm looking forward to playing tomorrow.	4940_0.a	2013-01-02	F	4940	Monica Puig	Angelique Kerber	How much confidence does that give you just the way you fought back today?	4940_0.q	5.0	1	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL	International
4940_1	Maybe. I don't know. Of course it's good to having matches like this that you need to playing 100% and just fighting like this. But of course it's also tough physically, and I hope that I can recover soon and be fit tomorrow.	4940_1.a	2013-01-02	F	4940	Monica Puig	Angelique Kerber	In your preparation for a major, is it better to have such a tight result like that than to sweep through pretty easily?	4940_1.q	5.0	1	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL	International
4940_2	Yeah, for sure it was a surprise how she played. I didn't know her before, but, yeah, I'm sure that she'll coming very soon top 50. Yeah.	4940_2.a	2013-01-02	F	4940	Monica Puig	Angelique Kerber	Was it a pretty big surprise? You really didn't know what that expect today?	4940_2.q	5.0	1	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL	International
4940_3	I think she returns very well, so her return was great. Also she moves good and just hit the balls very deep and hard. So you just need to try to play like she was playing. It was a little bit difficult today.	4940_3.a	2013-01-02	F	4940	Monica Puig	Angelique Kerber	What was the most difficult? Her serve?	4940_3.q	5.0	1	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL	International
4940_4	I was just thinking point by point. I was not thinking what's happen. I was not thinking what's can happen. I was just really on court and just try to hit the balls, moving very well, and just fighting every point. That was in my mind and nothing else actually.	4940_4.a	2013-01-02	F	4940	Monica Puig	Angelique Kerber	Talk about that breakback game in the third set. You said you were down 14. You held your serve and then won that massive rally to get back in. What were you thinking at that stage?	4940_4.q	5.0	1	2nd Round	BRISBANE INTERNATIONAL	International
426_0	Well, I mean, it's been a very new thing, I mean, a few new things that, you know, has been on for me, and as you mentioned, I mean, for me it's a new team. Well, let's go one by one. I start with Azuz, my fitness guy in IPTL. So it's been almost a month that I have been able to do some fitness with him, some fitness preparation, and it's been very good. It's been almost all the things that we have done there, has been very new to me. You know, he's very professional in the sense that what he's doing, he find out very quickly what's my weak points and what's the things that I need to work on more. Immediately we start to do on that. Really, I think, that's what I feel on the court, that my movement is improving quite a lot. Really, I think that was a very good move. And then talking about Dani, I mean, we met with Dani for the week and maybe a week, 10 days, in Czech, and then we traveled to Thailand and already that we have managed to do a quite good preparation. What's very important is that it's a guy that he's very experienced and he knows quite a lot of, you know, the new things, new stuff. I think the most important fact is that it's a guy from basically from the outside coming to my team. He see many things in the different eyes, which is very good and he is very important to me. I really like the way that we are working so far.	426_0.a	2015-01-09	M	426	Andreas Seppi	Tomas Berdych	You are playing very, very well. Do you have any explanation about that? Is Vallverdu giving you something new? Did you do something special? Because you are playing...	426_0.q	7.0	1	Semifinals	QATAR EXXONMOBILE OPEN	ATP250
426_1	It's Azuz Simcich.	426_1.a	2015-01-09	M	426	Andreas Seppi	Tomas Berdych	(Question about spelling.)	426_1.q	7.0	1	Semifinals	QATAR EXXONMOBILE OPEN	ATP250
426_2	Croatia. He used to be, well, doing athletics, triple jump and then some sprints. But then when he stop he become a fitness trainer.	426_2.a	2015-01-09	M	426	Andreas Seppi	Tomas Berdych	From where?	426_2.q	7.0	1	Semifinals	QATAR EXXONMOBILE OPEN	ATP250
426_3	Well, I mean, for me, as a tall guy, I mean, the fitness and the movement on the court, it was definitely something that was a weak point. But it's not always just about you gonna do instead of do 10 sprints you're going to do 50 of them. It's also about how efficient you are and how able you can transform the power on the court. I think that's what he discovered very quickly, and that's what we are working on constantly and daily, and that's very important. It's a lot of trying to get that, you know, flexibility and that range, range of motion for my body. That's what I definitely need.	426_3.a	2015-01-09	M	426	Andreas Seppi	Tomas Berdych	(Off microphone.)	426_3.q	7.0	1	Semifinals	QATAR EXXONMOBILE OPEN	ATP250
426_4	Yeah, so far I'm feeling very good. I think it's a good followup on that, you know, practice, preparation that I have done and then also for the change, that it's been only my team. And I'm very glad that, you know, the things that we were working on that I'm able to bring them up on the tennis court so far and be able to transform them in such a short time. They are all kind of working, which is very good to me. And, yeah, I mean, it's four very good matches which I'm happy with. Some of them were in the tough conditions. Some of them were quite nice and pleasant, but, you know, now is the final. That's the last one and the most important one to go.	426_4.a	2015-01-09	M	426	Andreas Seppi	Tomas Berdych	Can you talk about how you're feeling this week, your matches played? (Off microphone.)	426_4.q	7.0	1	Semifinals	QATAR EXXONMOBILE OPEN	ATP250
426_5	Well, I mean, it's been quite similar with all of them. I mean, I managed to, you know, get the right game plan and then stick with that, tried to stay very close to the baseline, tried to stay on top of the opponent's game and trying to dictate the play with the shots and the selection shots that I want. And also, so far the selection that I have been doing, you know, trying to really taking the right shots in the right moment. That's, you know, quite enough to be working well and making good result so far.	426_5.a	2015-01-09	M	426	Andreas Seppi	Tomas Berdych	What went right for you tonight?	426_5.q	7.0	1	Semifinals	QATAR EXXONMOBILE OPEN	ATP250
426_6	Well, you can always see with two different ways, two different views.  I think it's not necessary to explain both of them.  But for me this is the way how I went through the tournament.  It's been so far quite easy by the result, but, you know, I still need to do my job and win those matches. I'm really happy with the way I handled it so far, that I get to the final and, you know, just going to face a very tough opponent. I'm going to try to do my best to, you know, make a first trophy of the year.	426_6.a	2015-01-09	M	426	Andreas Seppi	Tomas Berdych	(Off microphone.)	426_6.q	7.0	1	Semifinals	QATAR EXXONMOBILE OPEN	ATP250
426_7	Well, I mean, we already played, I mean, it's maybe like a week ago, that it's been exhibition match, but not in the way that, you know, we will have fun on the court and we really put a big effort to that match. I mean, we played almost three hours there, and it's been a pretty it was really good. You know, it was a very tough one. He's a big fighter. He's very solid from both sides, moving extremely well and very experienced guy. So again, I'm going to need to bring my weapons, all the cards that I have, try to play with them tomorrow in the final.	426_7.a	2015-01-09	M	426	Andreas Seppi	Tomas Berdych	What makes David such a tough opponent?	426_7.q	7.0	1	Semifinals	QATAR EXXONMOBILE OPEN	ATP250
845_0	I know.  I wish I knew.  When I saw this was call for physio I was like, Please no, not now.  I feel a little sorry for her.  US Open is coming and it's important tournament and she's playing very well.  Hopefully she can recover, you know.	845_0.a	2007-08-25	F	845	Agnes Szavay	Svetlana Kuznetsova	Three consecutive matches where your opponents have retired.  Is it the curse of Kuznetsova, or what's going on?	845_0.q	4.0	1	The Final	PILOT PEN TENNIS PRESENTED BY SCHICK	2
845_1	Well, it's really strange, you know, but only thing I can say is I've been -- most of the times I been winning.  Today was the closest match like I was close to lose, but also I was kind of getting my game back, you know, during the match and then she got tired. I cannot change it.  Only thing I can do is take it.	845_1.a	2007-08-25	F	845	Agnes Szavay	Svetlana Kuznetsova	How strange is it to win a tournament like this with three straight retirements?	845_1.q	4.0	1	The Final	PILOT PEN TENNIS PRESENTED BY SCHICK	2
845_2	It feels good.  I was playing only great tennis past weeks when I made it to the final, but then I couldn't make it in the final.  I was just not playing good.  My game wasn't going the right way.  I been missing so many easy forehands in the first set.  I think I change it in the second set and I start to hit and finally move to it. And, yeah, I just think like even was not playing my best to get it together it's better.	845_2.a	2007-08-25	F	845	Agnes Szavay	Svetlana Kuznetsova	This is the fifth final this year and your first win.  Talk about how it feels to win one.	845_2.q	4.0	1	The Final	PILOT PEN TENNIS PRESENTED BY SCHICK	2
845_3	I knew she was playing well because I heard from the girls she won some good matches, and I know she's tough.  But the thing is for me it's tough.  I never play her before. Definitely something going to happen weird because I never saw her play before.  So she plays very good tennis and has very backhand.  I guess everybody saw that. Yeah, during the match I had to be calm, you know.  I know some things were not going my way, but I still had to look she's doing and find keys for the match. Normally you play Dementieva you come in the match and you know the tactics and you know what to do.  My coach told me more or less how I have to play, but it's not the same thing.  Like, you know, I don't know what to expect from her.	845_3.a	2007-08-25	F	845	Agnes Szavay	Svetlana Kuznetsova	Did Agnes surprise you at all in the first set how well she was playing?	845_3.q	4.0	1	The Final	PILOT PEN TENNIS PRESENTED BY SCHICK	2
845_4	Oh, I don't know.  I say so much stuff I never remember what I say.	845_4.a	2007-08-25	F	845	Agnes Szavay	Svetlana Kuznetsova	Agnes said afterwards that you made her laugh.  What did you say to her?	845_4.q	4.0	1	The Final	PILOT PEN TENNIS PRESENTED BY SCHICK	2
845_5	I wish I would know, but now if I would say something I would make up the story and you guys still laugh but it won't be true.	845_5.a	2007-08-25	F	845	Agnes Szavay	Svetlana Kuznetsova	She said you made her feel better afterwards.	845_5.q	4.0	1	The Final	PILOT PEN TENNIS PRESENTED BY SCHICK	2
845_6	Sorry?  I didn't get the question.	845_6.a	2007-08-25	F	845	Agnes Szavay	Svetlana Kuznetsova	You must have felt that, you know, you have had the drop out of matches early because of this so you probably knew how she felt, and it must be so tough when have to do something like that at this level.	845_6.q	4.0	1	The Final	PILOT PEN TENNIS PRESENTED BY SCHICK	2
845_7	Oh, yes, I mean, for her I guess it was very hard.  She was crying and I really felt bad, you know, because I was playing the match and trying to do my thing.  But still I always feel bad for an opponent if an opponent hurt. I mean, she was playing some unbelievable game.  For her it's so bad like she play unbelievable match and she's confident and now this moment it just happens here.  But also, you know, you cannot ask from your body to play eight matches in a row in eight days.  It's pretty hard. The tennis now it's not soft.  We hit the ball pretty hard, and you saw how she hits the ball.  The US Open coming, so I just wish her to recover and have two days off.  I said some strange thing different and that's why I made her laugh, but I don't remember it.	845_7.a	2007-08-25	F	845	Agnes Szavay	Svetlana Kuznetsova	You must have a good sense of how hard it is to have to retire, and she's young and coming up and everything.  It must have been helpful for her to hear from you.	845_7.q	4.0	1	The Final	PILOT PEN TENNIS PRESENTED BY SCHICK	2
845_8	I'm not playing my best tennis and I think it's okay, because as I take example of my past good Grand Slams, you know, you don't have to play good tennis in the first matches.  It's important to go through and during the tournament to start feeling the ball better and better. I play good and I have quite enough matches under my belt, so I'm pretty comfortable with myself going in there and just going to be focus and do my best in my first match and hopefully to win it and to first good match.	845_8.a	2007-08-25	F	845	Agnes Szavay	Svetlana Kuznetsova	Can you talk about how you are going into the US Open?  Are you playing some of your best tennis?  Are you confident going into next week?	845_8.q	4.0	1	The Final	PILOT PEN TENNIS PRESENTED BY SCHICK	2
845_9	Yeah.  As I say again, against Schiavone it was set up.  It was 6-2, so I been winning.  It's not like I would be losing and then pull out and then nobody give it to me for free. Bu, yeah, it was easier win than to finish the match.  Same with Elena.  It was 3-Love.  She was like sick, you know, from heat, but I was feeling, too.  I was suffering a lot on the court and I had pretty bad evening afterward because it was very hard with the heat for me also. So I won this match, but more physically than playing the game.  But today, I mean, she just played so many matches.  It's really frustrating to win like this but still I say it again:  I take it.	845_9.a	2007-08-25	F	845	Agnes Szavay	Svetlana Kuznetsova	Svetlana, when you do win like this, do you actually feel like you won?  Do you know what I'm saying?  Three retirements in a row.	845_9.q	4.0	1	The Final	PILOT PEN TENNIS PRESENTED BY SCHICK	2
845_10	No.  It just came up like that.  It's always like when somebody is hurt and your opponent is hurt it's very hard to play.  Like when I'm hurt I have limited game.  The things hurt I don't do them, you know.  Like maybe, I don't know, my leg hurt I don't play so much backhand.  You just change your game. But then you don't depend on yourself when somebody else hurt.  I don't know what exactly movement she cannot do.  It's important I don't take it mentally otherwise you try ti do stuff you don't have to do.  Basically you have to stay and play the game, the same one you played.	845_10.a	2007-08-25	F	845	Agnes Szavay	Svetlana Kuznetsova	When you see her with the trainer do you change your game?  You had a couple drop shots immediately in the second set.	845_10.q	4.0	1	The Final	PILOT PEN TENNIS PRESENTED BY SCHICK	2
845_11	It has very good memories and also very bad memories.  To win one year and come the next year with injuries and lose first round.  But still, I try to stay with the good ones.  I just love New York and I just going enjoy this tournament as I do any other Grand Slam.  This is one of my favorite Grand Slams. I just miss New York a lot through the year and just looking forward to go there again and enjoy the game and enjoy the crowd.	845_11.a	2007-08-25	F	845	Agnes Szavay	Svetlana Kuznetsova	The US Open obviously has good memories for you.  Do you get excited now or have you been excited for a few weeks about the prospect of returning there?	845_11.q	4.0	1	The Final	PILOT PEN TENNIS PRESENTED BY SCHICK	2
3527_0	Well, I think I didn't play bad, no? But I think he played really good, really good match. I wasn't physically 100%, no? I had fever two days ago. Last night wasn't perfect, too. So I felt with less power than usual. I feel a little bit tired for the moments, and that's what happened in the second and in the third. I was 4-0, and with 4-0, I know that the match wasn't done. So it was important victory for me for the situation, because Lacko played, I think, very well, and I had to be there and fight all the time to win, so is important victory for me.	3527_0.a	2011-01-05	M	3527	Lukas Lacko	Rafael Nadal	Are you proud of the way you fought?	3527_0.q	1.0	1	2nd Round	QATAR EXXONMOBILE OPEN	ATP250
3527_1	Well, when I lost the serve for the second time in the second, I didn't fight anymore, because I say, Well, we gonna rest a little bit now and try my best in the third. I just know what I had to do to play a little bit better, no? I know I had to change the rhythm of the ball, play with a little bit more slice, with more topspin balls, high balls, and tried to change a little bit the rhythm, because he was touching the ball fantastic, and I didn't have enough power to have pain him with my shots, no? So I had to change a little bit and play a little bit more, with more strategy than usual.	3527_1.a	2011-01-05	M	3527	Lukas Lacko	Rafael Nadal	What did you tell yourself at the start of the third set?	3527_1.q	1.0	1	2nd Round	QATAR EXXONMOBILE OPEN	ATP250
3527_2	Well, sure, no? I am taking anti-inflammatories, I am taking antibiotics, and that's all that what can I -- I can, you know, how is the rules, and I can't take a lot of things, no?	3527_2.a	2011-01-05	M	3527	Lukas Lacko	Rafael Nadal	Are you taking any medicine or seeing the doctor?	3527_2.q	1.0	1	2nd Round	QATAR EXXONMOBILE OPEN	ATP250
3527_3	No, no, no. I didn't consider that. I always know I gonna play, yeah.	3527_3.a	2011-01-05	M	3527	Lukas Lacko	Rafael Nadal	Did you hesitate to play this morning? Did you hesitate to play this match?	3527_3.q	1.0	1	2nd Round	QATAR EXXONMOBILE OPEN	ATP250
3527_4	Yeah. Well, especially I know today, with all the respect, wasn't really difficult match in doubles, and maybe just be there and try to help a little bit my friend and play. And for me is good practice now. I know was a little bit tired for me after the tough match in singles going doubles. For that reason I go straight from the singles to the doubles and tried to play, focus on doubles. Worked well. We won. That's positive thing, and we are in semifinals in doubles. Happy for that. Right now tomorrow gonna be another day. That's still a good practice for me, play a lot of hours on court, because Australia is in one week and a half, and play long matches there, for sure, so that's good.	3527_4.a	2011-01-05	M	3527	Lukas Lacko	Rafael Nadal	And in doubles, too?	3527_4.q	1.0	1	2nd Round	QATAR EXXONMOBILE OPEN	ATP250
3527_5	No. I think I gonna be a little bit tired, but I am here to try my best. For sure my goal is to try to win tomorrow and try to be at my 100%.	3527_5.a	2011-01-05	M	3527	Lukas Lacko	Rafael Nadal	Do you think you will be able to be 100% tomorrow?	3527_5.q	1.0	1	2nd Round	QATAR EXXONMOBILE OPEN	ATP250
3527_6	We never won easy, never; not this year, not last year, not two years ago and not three, five years ago. The tour is very difficult. All the players are very competitive. They are very good professionals and very good tennis players, everybody here. You can lose and hope win against everybody. That's the sport, and I know when I go on court I can win and I can lose. For Roger I think is the same.	3527_6.a	2011-01-05	M	3527	Lukas Lacko	Rafael Nadal	Almost the same thing you met today, for Federer met so many difficulties to win his match. What does this mean for the two best classified players compared to the others? Can we wait for something, for surprises?	3527_6.q	1.0	1	2nd Round	QATAR EXXONMOBILE OPEN	ATP250
3527_7	What kind of privilege?	3527_7.a	2011-01-05	M	3527	Lukas Lacko	Rafael Nadal	You don't feel privileged? You don't have feel you have privilege compared to the other players?	3527_7.q	1.0	1	2nd Round	QATAR EXXONMOBILE OPEN	ATP250
3527_8	Well, the ranking says I am the No.1 now, but when you go on court, doesn't matter if you are No.1 or No.10. When you go on court, gonna win, the player who plays better that day. And if Lacko play better than me today, he will beat me anyway if he is the 50 and I am No.1. When I am playing, I am not thinking if I am No.1. I am thinking about try to play well and try to win the match. I think the opponent thinks the same.	3527_8.a	2011-01-05	M	3527	Lukas Lacko	Rafael Nadal	That you are No.1.	3527_8.q	1.0	1	2nd Round	QATAR EXXONMOBILE OPEN	ATP250
1035_0	We were on serve up until 5-4 in the first set.  We were both like serving really good.  And then at 30-All, she hit two good returns to win the set. In the first set I think it was just a few points here and there that changed who won the first set. In the second set I think I lost my serve early on .  And then again, she was still serving good.  It was hard for me to break her.  It was 6-3. I finished holding my serve.  She was just really tough to break.  She was hitting really good second serves.  I think she just played well.	1035_0.a	2007-08-31	F	1035	Dinara Safina	Ahsha Rolle	What happened out there today?	1035_0.q	109.0	0	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1035_1	I think I could have played a little bit better.  I could have played crucial points a little bit better.  I feel like I had a couple of bad shot selection shots that kind of cost me big games, but I don't think I played bad. I served okay.  Like I tried to compete as hard as I could, so I did the best I could.	1035_1.a	2007-08-31	F	1035	Dinara Safina	Ahsha Rolle	How do you think you played?	1035_1.q	109.0	0	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1035_2	Yeah, obviously she has more experience than me in those situations.  I definitely think I'll improve.  Just focus a little better in those situations.  As I keep going, I'll keep getting better.	1035_2.a	2007-08-31	F	1035	Dinara Safina	Ahsha Rolle	Is that an experience thing?  Do you think the more times you're in situations like that, something like that will improve?	1035_2.q	109.0	0	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1035_3	She hits big off both sides.  She has a really good backhand.  She hits the ball pretty deep.  So it was tough for me.  Like during the rally, it was hard for me to get the offensive when she was always pushing me back.	1035_3.a	2007-08-31	F	1035	Dinara Safina	Ahsha Rolle	Outside of her serve, were there other aspects of her game that gave you trouble?	1035_3.q	109.0	0	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1035_4	I don't know what that was, but I heard it.  I looked up, but...  Didn't bother me that much, just for that second.	1035_4.a	2007-08-31	F	1035	Dinara Safina	Ahsha Rolle	The pounding noise.	1035_4.q	109.0	0	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1035_5	I heard it.  I don't know what it was.  Oh, well.  It's New York.	1035_5.a	2007-08-31	F	1035	Dinara Safina	Ahsha Rolle	You were serving at 5-5.	1035_5.q	109.0	0	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1035_6	It's definitely a huge confidence booster.  I mean, it just gives me confidence to know I can play with the top players, beat them.  I'm just going to go back and work even harder, get even better.	1035_6.a	2007-08-31	F	1035	Dinara Safina	Ahsha Rolle	What does your showing here do for your confidence?	1035_6.q	109.0	0	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1035_7	They're always kind of noises.  You got fans screaming, saying different things, people walking during points, walking around. There's all kinds of things in the crowd that's going on.  You just got to focus what's going on on the court.	1035_7.a	2007-08-31	F	1035	Dinara Safina	Ahsha Rolle	The pounding, is that part of New York?  Tell us about playing here.	1035_7.q	109.0	0	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1035_8	Yeah.	1035_8.a	2007-08-31	F	1035	Dinara Safina	Ahsha Rolle	As far as you know, is this the only place that happens?	1035_8.q	109.0	0	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1035_9	Right, exactly.  But I love it.  I mean, all those fans were so out there for me, screaming my name.  It was amazing.  I'll never forget this experience.	1035_9.a	2007-08-31	F	1035	Dinara Safina	Ahsha Rolle	That's part of the whole package?	1035_9.q	109.0	0	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1035_10	I'm going to go home and train for a little bit and I'm going to go to Asia.	1035_10.a	2007-08-31	F	1035	Dinara Safina	Ahsha Rolle	Where do you go from here?	1035_10.q	109.0	0	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1035_11	Yeah, definitely.  Got to go pay some bills.	1035_11.a	2007-08-31	F	1035	Dinara Safina	Ahsha Rolle	Are you looking forward to cashing your third-round winner's check?	1035_11.q	109.0	0	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1035_12	I'm not sure.  Not sure.  Hopefully I'll finally be top hundred.  I've been trying to get that all year.  We'll see.	1035_12.a	2007-08-31	F	1035	Dinara Safina	Ahsha Rolle	Do you know what your ranking will be after this showing?	1035_12.q	109.0	0	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4741_0	I don't know. Yeah, I don't know how I feel. It's still strange. I talked to my grandparents after. My grandma was just like, Oh, good job. They want to talk about my coach more than they want to talk about the actual match. I listened to them and they calmed me down a little bit, so it was good.	4741_0.a	2013-01-23	F	4741	Serena Williams	Sloane Stephens	You weren't able to express your emotions in the court earlier. Maybe you can express them now after a few minutes after you won.	4741_0.q	25.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4741_1	Uhm, last night I was thinking about it and I was like someone asked me like, Do you think you can win? I was like, Yeah, I think so, but I wasn't like too clear about it. Then this morning when I got up, I was like, Look, dude, like, you can do this. Like, go out and play and do your best. I think I was convinced that I was able to do it when I lost serve in the first game in the second set and I went down 20. And I was like, Hmm, this is not the way you want it to happen. But you just fight and just get every ball back, run every ball down, and just get a lot of balls in play, I think you'll be okay. From then on I got aggressive, started coming to the net more, and just got a lot more comfortable. I just kind of just kind of played my game from there, I think.	4741_1.a	2013-01-23	F	4741	Serena Williams	Sloane Stephens	Not many people gave you a chance to do what you just did. What chance did you give yourself before you stepped out on the court?	4741_1.q	25.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4741_2	Yeah, I mean, she was serving at lower speeds, but her serve, she hits spots. No matter how slow it's going, it's right on the line. It's still a really good serve even though it's much slower. But, no, her serve was affected definitely, but she was still hitting pretty good off the ground, I thought.	4741_2.a	2013-01-23	F	4741	Serena Williams	Sloane Stephens	Did her back problems throw you off? Did that affect your game?	4741_2.q	25.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4741_3	At what point?	4741_3.a	2013-01-23	F	4741	Serena Williams	Sloane Stephens	Did you feel some nerves at that point, and also when you had set point?	4741_3.q	25.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4741_4	Uhm, yeah, I think I served for the set. I mean, it was 53, 54, but, I mean, I was nervous, yeah. But then I was like, Forget it. Might as well just go for it. So I kind of just played through it, I think.	4741_4.a	2013-01-23	F	4741	Serena Williams	Sloane Stephens	When you had set points in the second set, the first ones.	4741_4.q	25.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4741_5	Yeah.	4741_5.a	2013-01-23	F	4741	Serena Williams	Sloane Stephens	You had a set point and three errors in that service game.	4741_5.q	25.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4741_6	No. I wasn't even I was just trying to focus on me really.	4741_6.a	2013-01-23	F	4741	Serena Williams	Sloane Stephens	Did you feel in the third set when she broke at 43, did you feel that she got nervous?	4741_6.q	25.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4741_7	No. I've seen her do it before. But this is tennis; it happens. I mean, sometimes you just get frustrated and things like that happen. But, I mean, obviously it's a tough situation. You're playing a close match and it happened. But, I mean, she's still going to play no matter what, smashed racquets, no smashed racquets, so...	4741_7.a	2013-01-23	F	4741	Serena Williams	Sloane Stephens	What about when Serena started beating up on her racquet and whacked it a couple times into the ground? Were you thinking, I'm the one who just made Serena Williams do that?	4741_7.q	25.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4741_8	No. I mean, you're playing Serena, one of the best competitors in the world. She might smash a racquet, but she's still going to play hard. It was definitely like, Wow, that just happened. But it was more like, Okay, now you even have to play harder because she's going to be firing.	4741_8.a	2013-01-23	F	4741	Serena Williams	Sloane Stephens	When you see someone unravelling like that, does that give you a mental edge?	4741_8.q	25.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4741_9	Good match; well played. I say the same thing every time, so... Good match, well played. She just said, Good match. I think she said the same thing, yeah. I don't even remember, honestly.	4741_9.a	2013-01-23	F	4741	Serena Williams	Sloane Stephens	What did you say to her at the net at the end of the match?	4741_9.q	25.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4741_10	Uhm, I just I mean, I kind of just was hanging out. Just chillax and gave me a little break. I don't know. I mean, I've gotten it a lot recently. In the last three weeks it's happened to me a lot, so I was prepared. I kind of like go through like some things in my head and then look and see what my coach is doing. And he was eating a chicken sandwich when that happened. So, I mean, kind of just little things. But it doesn't really bother me as much anymore.	4741_10.a	2013-01-23	F	4741	Serena Williams	Sloane Stephens	How did you keep your focus when she was off court? Had you experienced that sort of thing? How did you keep your focus?	4741_10.q	25.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4741_11	No, it was okay. I mean, in my secondround match I played someone who went to the bathroom for seven minutes. I mean, that three minutes was really no big deal. So it was okay.	4741_11.a	2013-01-23	F	4741	Serena Williams	Sloane Stephens	Did it seem a long period of time?	4741_11.q	25.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4741_12	I definitely improved a lot. I mean, definitely last year it was all new to me and it was just kind of a new experience. Like I said last  or even in Brisbane. It was the first time, so it was tough. But once you get by  the first time you do anything it's tricky. I think I was kind of just ready to play. Of course, I've improved a lot and worked really hard on my fitness and all that other stuff. So I was definitely grateful that the year that has gone by has been a good one.	4741_12.a	2013-01-23	F	4741	Serena Williams	Sloane Stephens	This time last year you were calling her a tennis god and you hadn't established a relationship with her. Today you beat the tennis god. Talk about your mental improvement and ability.	4741_12.q	25.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4741_13	I couldn't really do anything because the messages were coming in, so I couldn't read like anything. I was like, Wait, this is pointless. So I just put it down. But, yeah, my mom. I couldn't reach my mom. I called. So I had to call my brother and he couldn't even talk. He was like freaking out. I was like, Okay, where's mom? I was like, Okay, never mind. Bye. But, yeah, I did talk to them.	4741_13.a	2013-01-23	F	4741	Serena Williams	Sloane Stephens	You went for the Smartphone pretty fast after the match. I know you were looking for a text from your mom. What was the first thing you saw?	4741_13.q	25.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4741_14	Uhm, no, not really. I mean, I always love watching her play obviously, but never tried to like copycat or anything like that.	4741_14.a	2013-01-23	F	4741	Serena Williams	Sloane Stephens	Do you remember the first time you watched the game of Serena on TV? When you were a little girl, did you ever try to learn from her on TV and imitate her?	4741_14.q	25.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4741_15	I mean, it's definitely  it's really tough, because people say that like you don't have tough matches, like if you play someone that's like your age. But it's definitely harder playing like Laura Robson or Jovanovski, someone who sis your age, rather than playing someone  like if I played Vesnina. Like it wouldn't be  like you don't feel as much pressure playing Vesnina, but you feel a lot of pressure playing someone who is your age, who you're close to. Obviously, it was difficult playing Jovanovski. It's for the quarters of a slam. I wasn't playing my best. It got a little tricky. Today I just really didn't have anything to lose. I mean, you're playing for the semis of a Grand Slam. You just got to go out and do it really.	4741_15.a	2013-01-23	F	4741	Serena Williams	Sloane Stephens	How much better did you play today than you did in your fourthround match?	4741_15.q	25.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4741_16	I had 17,000; now I have 35,000 (smiling).	4741_16.a	2013-01-23	F	4741	Serena Williams	Sloane Stephens	I know you're a big tweeter. How many followers did you have before this match?	4741_16.q	25.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4741_17	Yeah, definitely. And John Legend tweeted me. Dirk tweeted me. I mean, I'm just excited. I want John Legend to sing at my wedding. I was like, Oh, my God. He tweeted me. What can I do? I don't know. I'm still thinking.	4741_17.a	2013-01-23	F	4741	Serena Williams	Sloane Stephens	So you should just beat Serena more and more and keep doubling and doubling.	4741_17.q	25.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4741_18	Well, I have like 200 and something now. Wait, I can tell you how many. 213 on this one. This is kind of cool. Yeah, I have 213 on this one, and then I don't use this one. I only talk to one person, two people on this phone, and I had like 20 messages. I was like, Oh, interesting. But, yeah.	4741_18.a	2013-01-23	F	4741	Serena Williams	Sloane Stephens	How many messages did you end up with on your phone?	4741_18.q	25.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4741_19	Well, I'm still trying to figure that out because I thought it was free to receive text messages, but someone told me otherwise. So I'm still trying to figure out what I'm going to do, because otherwise my phone bill is going to be crazy and my mom is going to be like, Oh, my God, your phone bill. She's going to be like, The money you were going to buy yourself something nice with, you're going to pay your phone bill.	4741_19.a	2013-01-23	F	4741	Serena Williams	Sloane Stephens	How on earth are you going to respond or reply?	4741_19.q	25.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4741_20	Yes, definitely. I mean, I should have made some more bets on like people wearing my tennis clothes or something, because, honestly, not playing from US Open till January, that's really tough. I took a lot of time off just kind of being a normal kid, doing whatever. To be in the semis of a Grand Slam is definitely I say a good accomplishment. A lot of hard work. But it's nice to just it's nice to be in this position.	4741_20.a	2013-01-23	F	4741	Serena Williams	Sloane Stephens	When you came in, you said you were just going to go for it. At this stage now, to be where you are, is that beyond the wildest expectations you had at the start of the Australian summer?	4741_20.q	25.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4741_21	No, I was stretching, and I was like, I'm in the semis of a Grand Slam. I was like, Whoa. It wasn't as hard as I thought. But it's pretty cool.	4741_21.a	2013-01-23	F	4741	Serena Williams	Sloane Stephens	When is the moment walking through the corridors when you sort of pinch yourself and say, I've done this?	4741_21.q	25.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4741_22	Gonna be a totally different match. Uhm, I'm just going to go out and play my best, obviously. Do what I do really well and just play my game. Just hopefully, you know, play well again.	4741_22.a	2013-01-23	F	4741	Serena Williams	Sloane Stephens	Talk about Azarenka.	4741_22.q	25.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4741_23	No.	4741_23.a	2013-01-23	F	4741	Serena Williams	Sloane Stephens	One of those messages wasn't from the White House, was it?	4741_23.q	25.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4741_24	From the White House? Well, if you know that thenI	4741_24.a	2013-01-23	F	4741	Serena Williams	Sloane Stephens	I think you're going to get one.	4741_24.q	25.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4741_25	No, no. You know, whatever. I really want to go to the President's Easter egg hunt, so if you could put in a good word for me.	4741_25.a	2013-01-23	F	4741	Serena Williams	Sloane Stephens	I don't know it.	4741_25.q	25.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4741_26	I was thinking  I actually had to think in my head, I was like, Do they really have to read all of her championships? I was like, Really? But, uhm, I was okay. I literally was thinking in my head, Is he seriously reading every single tournament she's won? It was okay. I thought about it for two seconds, but it was fine.	4741_26.a	2013-01-23	F	4741	Serena Williams	Sloane Stephens	Back to the very start of the match in warmup, Bernard Tomic said after playing Federer that before the match he kind of felt good, and then they started reading out the honor roll. Did you go through anything like that, having it play with your mind?	4741_26.q	25.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4741_27	Let's do it. Let's just go ahead and do it. Obviously a lot of hard work. Just grateful to be in this position and just happy that, uhm, everything that I've done has come together.	4741_27.a	2013-01-23	F	4741	Serena Williams	Sloane Stephens	After the US Open, if someone would have told you Australian Open semifinals in four months, what would you have said?	4741_27.q	25.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4741_28	I'd be doing big things, so it would be nice. No, just take it one day at a time obviously. Just play my best really. Just have fun, enjoy it. I'm kind of upset my mom's not here, and my brother. I know definitely everyone's watching back home and is very proud of me, so just do my best and make them happy.	4741_28.a	2013-01-23	F	4741	Serena Williams	Sloane Stephens	You were talking in Hobart about wanting to get your firstever title. What would it be like to get your firstever title at a Grand Slam?	4741_28.q	25.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4741_29	Well, Brisbane helped me because I got the first time we played out of the way. First time is always tough. Definitely I was glad that I got it there, because I hadn't played any matches and it helped me raise my level. Going into Hobart I had been playing well. Unfortunately, I lost in the semis, which was fine. But then came in here with a lot of confidence and playing well. That match definitely helped me coming into this week, last week and this week.	4741_29.a	2013-01-23	F	4741	Serena Williams	Sloane Stephens	How much did you feel like Brisbane helped you facing Serena, sort of the experience there from going into today on this stage?	4741_29.q	25.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4741_30	I don't know. Uhm, well, on the court, I don't know where I got that from. It's just kind of like, I don't know, just stay calm. No need to panic, just stay calm. Off the court I'm totally not like that, so I don't know. Like am I two different people?	4741_30.a	2013-01-23	F	4741	Serena Williams	Sloane Stephens	You seem to be very calm and quiet on the court. Is this your true personality or do you have some mental work as well?	4741_30.q	25.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4741_31	Yeah, it's kind of cool.	4741_31.a	2013-01-23	F	4741	Serena Williams	Sloane Stephens	It's a natural ability.	4741_31.q	25.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4741_32	No, I really just wasn't thinking about anything other than myself because I was like, I'm going to get distracted. I'm going to start thinking about something else and it's going to be a mess. I just tried to stay focused on myself, stay within myself, because otherwise it would have been a disaster.	4741_32.a	2013-01-23	F	4741	Serena Williams	Sloane Stephens	When she got hurt in the second set, how difficult was it to stay calm? Did you think about changing tactics? What was going through your head?	4741_32.q	25.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4741_33	Well, I online shop a lot. Well, when I'm away from home, I watch a lot of TV shows. So I do that. I go to the same dinner restaurant every night. I mean, I'm kind of saying I just do the same thing all the time. But, I mean, when I'm not at a tournament, I love sports. I love basketball, football, watch all kinds of sports. I just keep updated on life really.	4741_33.a	2013-01-23	F	4741	Serena Williams	Sloane Stephens	Since you are a different person off the court, can you share what you do in your leisure time?	4741_33.q	25.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4741_34	I started working with David, I think Wimbledon was our first tournament that we started last year. So I don't know. I don't know how many months that is. Awhile, though.	4741_34.a	2013-01-23	F	4741	Serena Williams	Sloane Stephens	When did you start working with your current coach?	4741_34.q	25.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
5364_0	No, I think it doesn't affect. He was fell off, but, you know, the first game I won finally because I had breakpoint down. And finally, I think Del Potro, he play better than me. He deserve to win today.	5364_0.a	2013-07-03	M	5364	Juan Martin Del Potro	David Ferrer	How much did his early injury timeout affect the match? Looked like it might be pretty serious.	5364_0.q	4.0	0	Quarterfinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
5364_1	No. I am trying to do my best all the time. I think the first set I didn't play so good. I didn't serve very consistent with the first serve. But in the second and third I play better. But Juan Martin, he was more focus, he was playing more aggressive than me, and he serve very, very good the all three sets.	5364_1.a	2013-07-03	M	5364	Juan Martin Del Potro	David Ferrer	Did the injury make you change the way you played, your game plan?	5364_1.q	4.0	0	Quarterfinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
5364_2	Bananas or bar, you know. Bar of cereals, but nothing special.	5364_2.a	2013-07-03	M	5364	Juan Martin Del Potro	David Ferrer	A question about nutrition. What do you eat during the match?	5364_2.q	4.0	0	Quarterfinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
5364_3	Well, of course Del Potro, he has chance for to be in the final. He won one Grand Slam. He's young player. I think he has everything for to win another Grand Slam. He do it.	5364_3.a	2013-07-03	M	5364	Juan Martin Del Potro	David Ferrer	A lot of people have been talking for the last week or so, and everyone seems to have put Andy and Novak in the final already. Is Del Potro playing well enough that he could cause an upset?	5364_3.q	4.0	0	Quarterfinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
5364_4	No, nothing. I talk with the doctor. We did the same than the other times with the infiltration. I have pain, but when I tried to warm up I can't warm up because I have pain with my ankle. I did the same yesterday, after yesterday, and I won the match, so is not excuse.	5364_4.a	2013-07-03	M	5364	Juan Martin Del Potro	David Ferrer	There were rumors on the Internet saying you had to cut short your practice session because of an injury. Did you play with some sort of injury today?	5364_4.q	4.0	0	Quarterfinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
5364_5	No, no. The match, no, it was perfect.	5364_5.a	2013-07-03	M	5364	Juan Martin Del Potro	David Ferrer	Did you feel the pain more acutely during the match?	5364_5.q	4.0	0	Quarterfinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
5364_6	It is very important for me and my career. I never have been 3 of the world, so I am very satisfaction myself.	5364_6.a	2013-07-03	M	5364	Juan Martin Del Potro	David Ferrer	You will be No.3 in the next rankings. Everyone has been talking about the big four for so long. How proud are you being No.3?	5364_6.q	4.0	0	Quarterfinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
5364_7	No, is not important. No, only the ankle.	5364_7.a	2013-07-03	M	5364	Juan Martin Del Potro	David Ferrer	Was the issue with you physically the ankle only or the toe as well?	5364_7.q	4.0	0	Quarterfinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
5364_8	Yeah, of course I need to rest three or four weeks. I will take two weeks of holiday, sure, and I will have to treatment my ankle, because is very important because the USA season is very important for me. Now I think I have time. I think I have never been three weeks or four weeks stop playing any tournament. So now is perfect for to rest. I am 31 years old and I need to take my time.	5364_8.a	2013-07-03	M	5364	Juan Martin Del Potro	David Ferrer	You've been playing very intense tennis for a long period of time now. Do you feel you've been playing so much tennis you need a rest?	5364_8.q	4.0	0	Quarterfinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
5364_9	No, I will go to home. I will go to my small village with my family and friends, and I will treatment with my physio.	5364_9.a	2013-07-03	M	5364	Juan Martin Del Potro	David Ferrer	Where will you go to rest?	5364_9.q	4.0	0	Quarterfinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
5364_10	No.	5364_10.a	2013-07-03	M	5364	Juan Martin Del Potro	David Ferrer	Now that you will be No.3, does it change your expectations at all going into the U.S. season?	5364_10.q	4.0	0	Quarterfinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
5364_11	No, change nothing. Is only a number. I am very happy for that, but nothing. I will do the same like I am doing.	5364_11.a	2013-07-03	M	5364	Juan Martin Del Potro	David Ferrer	Do you feel like you need to making more finals or win more tournaments?	5364_11.q	4.0	0	Quarterfinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
5364_12	Well, no, I was not thinking nothing. I was only focus with me. Del Potro, he try to play again. If he try to play again is because he was good, no?	5364_12.a	2013-07-03	M	5364	Juan Martin Del Potro	David Ferrer	How did you think Del Potro would play after he had that fall?	5364_12.q	4.0	0	Quarterfinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
5364_13	No, huhuh. No, I was only focus with my game. And, of course, he's a very good player. I know him. Del Potro, he's top 10. He won US Open. I played a lot of time with him. I know him and he knows me.	5364_13.a	2013-07-03	M	5364	Juan Martin Del Potro	David Ferrer	What did he show you by the way he played? Were there any surprises in the way he played?	5364_13.q	4.0	0	Quarterfinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
5364_14	I don't know. Ask to him. I don't know. He's a very good player. All the players will fell sometimes. He's a hard player, sure, because he's very good player. He's top 10. He's No.6 or 7 of the world.	5364_14.a	2013-07-03	M	5364	Juan Martin Del Potro	David Ferrer	Did he show you anything about how tough he is after that fall, to play as well as he did after?	5364_14.q	4.0	0	Quarterfinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6427_0	Third.	6427_0.a	2014-06-25	F	6427	nan	Victoria Azarenka	Given it's only your fourth match back.	6427_0.q	8.0	0	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6427_1	Well, there were some things that, you know, you can always take something positive from the match. The thing is that I created a lot of things to make happen for me today. I just didn't use any of those opportunities. All that stuff that I built up was good, but not taking advantage was not great.	6427_1.a	2014-06-25	F	6427	nan	Victoria Azarenka	Was there any level which you felt satisfied today in general?	6427_1.q	8.0	0	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6427_2	It's consistency. It's not enough. It's a little bit too many mistakes like not closing the opportunities, not being sharp enough. There are a lot of things that still has to be tuned and has to be practiced. It basically goes down to back to work.	6427_2.a	2014-06-25	F	6427	nan	Victoria Azarenka	At Eastbourne you said you were missing timing because you hadn't had match practice. Was it more that, lacking that sharpness?	6427_2.q	8.0	0	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6427_3	I mean, she played well. I don't want to take credit away from her or anything. I always look at what I did. I don't really care what the person done in front of me. I felt today it was a lot up to me from not converting. I just looked at the board. Not converting 16 breakpoints, that's just ridiculous to me.	6427_3.a	2014-06-25	F	6427	nan	Victoria Azarenka	What are your thoughts on your opponent's level of play today and her game in general?	6427_3.q	8.0	0	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6427_4	How much?	6427_4.a	2014-06-25	F	6427	nan	Victoria Azarenka	In terms of coming back, how much do you need match play in order to get sharper?	6427_4.q	8.0	0	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6427_5	Practice, matches both.	6427_5.a	2014-06-25	F	6427	nan	Victoria Azarenka	Do you think you need matches most of all to get back to where you want to be?	6427_5.q	8.0	0	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6427_6	I had to start from somewhere. It didn't really matter where it is. I had to start. I had to start playing and see if I can play painfree. The advantage or disadvantage, I don't really look at it. I just start from here and that's what it is. It's a buildup and I'm going to have to just work hard. I have a lot of work to do. It's as simple as that. It's just work and play and practice, all of it together.	6427_6.a	2014-06-25	F	6427	nan	Victoria Azarenka	I suppose the disadvantage is it's such a short grass court season. Was it more about getting back on the tour and back into the process of playing?	6427_6.q	8.0	0	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6427_7	Yeah, but I want to look at it because I have a lot of big margins to fill up, too. That's the mentality and approach I'm going to take.	6427_7.a	2014-06-25	F	6427	nan	Victoria Azarenka	You say you have a lot of work to do. Do you feel it's small margins between where you want to be?	6427_7.q	8.0	0	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6427_8	It is. I'm just really pissed off right now for not taking those opportunities. I think that's okay to be that way because I really need to go through that and learn from it and just take it from here. I have to be honest with what is in front of me. I can look at it as things that I created so many opportunities that I could have taken. That's a good thing. But also not converting is not satisfying and I need to be better.	6427_8.a	2014-06-25	F	6427	nan	Victoria Azarenka	When you're in the middle of it, is it hard to be patient, know that it's going to take a little time to get back?	6427_8.q	8.0	0	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6427_9	Match endurance is important to stay more consistent in the matches. It's going to come with matches. But physically I feel fine.	6427_9.a	2014-06-25	F	6427	nan	Victoria Azarenka	Physically how do you think you are right now? Do you think match fitness, endurance you have to build up?	6427_9.q	8.0	0	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6427_10	Well, I have to be. I have to be realistic. I cannot sit here and say it's all great, because there's no moving forward from there. I'm going to be hard on myself just because I want to be better.	6427_10.a	2014-06-25	F	6427	nan	Victoria Azarenka	Are you someone who is very hard on yourself? That's quite a critical analysis you had of your game.	6427_10.q	8.0	0	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6427_11	I did a little bit, but not too much. I don't really watch much in general. Like I don't watch every day. But if it's on TV and I'm somewhere, yeah, I'll watch.	6427_11.a	2014-06-25	F	6427	nan	Victoria Azarenka	Did you not watch tennis over the time you weren't playing?	6427_11.q	8.0	0	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6427_12	It's always important to play your best tennis no matter what season or what tournament you're at. As I said before, I have a lot of work to do and I'm looking forward to that. I love those tournaments. I play every year. I'm going to work hard to do my best and be better to perform at those.	6427_12.a	2014-06-25	F	6427	nan	Victoria Azarenka	You're coming into a big part of the season for you, the U.S. hard court, defending a title in Cincinnati. How big is it for you to start playing the way you want to?	6427_12.q	8.0	0	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6427_13	Do I ever expect anything from myself? Did you ever hear me, I expect that? I don't think so. I'm going to work hard. What I expect from myself is to work hard and give my best every single day.	6427_13.a	2014-06-25	F	6427	nan	Victoria Azarenka	Do you have any idea what you expect for yourself?	6427_13.q	8.0	0	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6427_14	No, no, I'm very happy that I'm playing. I'm just being very realistic of what I've done today. After losing a match like this, it's not very satisfying. But there are things that I'm happy with. I just need to look at the things that I need to improve. That's what I want to focus on, things that I want to improve. I want to go back to practice like tomorrow, maybe even today. That's it. I'm very motivated. I'm not taking that as a downer, this match. I'm going to take it as motivation to be better.	6427_14.a	2014-06-25	F	6427	nan	Victoria Azarenka	After having gone through an injury and coming back, athletes have more of an appreciation when they do that. Do you have that feeling now? It was a long stretch to be out.	6427_14.q	8.0	0	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
6427_15	I don't care. I'm ready to work.	6427_15.a	2014-06-25	F	6427	nan	Victoria Azarenka	Do you feel it will be harder to get back to world No.1 than it was for you to reach it?	6427_15.q	8.0	0	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1738_0	Yeah, I mean, I was winning my service games pretty comfortably, you know, except at one stage in I think in the second set maybe it was. But I was playing well. You know, I was feeling good out there on the court. It was perfect conditions to play. I was playing a good and tough match. I'm always very, you know, relaxed, so today was no different really.	1738_0.a	2008-07-04	M	1738	Marat Safin	Roger Federer	You seemed to be very relaxed and confident. At 2-All in the third set you hit one shot under the leg, another one behind the back. Is that what you really felt at that moment?	1738_0.q	1.0	1	Semifinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1738_1	Uhm, well, easy in terms of, you know, being able to control a really dangerous player who's got the potential to upset anyone, you know. So in this aspect, yes. I mean, it was quite easy if you look at the score now. I was able to break him in the first game of the match and in the last game of the match. I think in between I was just really consistent, didn't really give him too many chances. It was a perfect match for me.	1738_1.a	2008-07-04	M	1738	Marat Safin	Roger Federer	Was it easy today?	1738_1.q	1.0	1	Semifinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1738_2	Yeah, I mean, we don't know how he's going to play yet. But, I mean, it's not going to come down to conditional -- you know, just to fitness in the final. We've got a day off, as well. If I would have played five hours today, I don't think it would have mattered a whole lot. It would have been worse for Rafa, because maybe he couldn't have finished today. So, no, I mean, I'm just happy to have won again in straight sets, beating a great player. You know, it's a huge thrill every time when I get to another Wimbledon finals because it's a big occasion.	1738_2.a	2008-07-04	M	1738	Marat Safin	Roger Federer	Were you relieved it was straight sets, given that Rafa might have a quick one?	1738_2.q	1.0	1	Semifinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1738_3	Well, he's always very fiery as a character. You know, he's never really changed over all the years. So, you know, it seems when he does that he tends to play better - sort of like John McEnroe was like. So it's always a little dangerous because he gets the crowd involved, you know, by doing that. The momentum can shift sometimes because of it, you know. And thank God I've played him plenty of times and I've got so much experience that it's not going to worry me really a whole lot.	1738_3.a	2008-07-04	M	1738	Marat Safin	Roger Federer	What were you reading from Marat Safin's attitude on the other side of the net? Were you expecting something else, other kind of attitude?	1738_3.q	1.0	1	Semifinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1738_4	Yeah, I mean, pretty simple: I mean, I haven't had many problems whatsoever throughout The Championships. It's been, you know, a perfect way to the finals, but there's one more left. You know, I need to win to get it. But so far it's been quite unbelievable, actually.	1738_4.a	2008-07-04	M	1738	Marat Safin	Roger Federer	Now that you're here in the final, how would you describe your whole route to get to this point?	1738_4.q	1.0	1	Semifinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1738_5	Yeah, I mean, big question mark. You know, I think we always hope that we can live up to the expectations, you know, because by now we've had so many sort of good matches against each other. It's hard to live up to them all the time. So Paris was sort of a disappointment, you know, in terms of living up to the expectations. But that happens sometimes. You know, for me it's obviously important to sort of bounce back from that loss. You know, even though I'm not going to draw anything out of that match because Rafa plays so different on clay and grass. He plays so much closer to the baseline that I have to draw from my two previous Wimbledon finals. So we'll see what happens.	1738_5.a	2008-07-04	M	1738	Marat Safin	Roger Federer	Assuming it is Rafael Nadal in the final, what do you think the match could turn out to be after that incredible last year?	1738_5.q	1.0	1	Semifinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1738_6	Well, I mean, I wasn't an overwhelming favorite going into the Philippoussis final or into the Roddick in the first final in '04. Maybe after that I was always the favorite, but that's only been two or three times. So it's not been a whole lot. Look, I mean, I don't think it matters really a lot if I'm the favorite or not. I'm on an incredible winning streak on grass. First somebody has to be able to break that, you know, before we start talking differently. But, yeah, should be an interesting final. I don't know if Rafa's gonna win this, but it's definitely going to be an interesting match if it happens.	1738_6.a	2008-07-04	M	1738	Marat Safin	Roger Federer	It's been a while since you've been in a Wimbledon final not as the sort of racing certainty favorite. Will that make life a bit easier for you in that you're not such a heavy favorite this time?	1738_6.q	1.0	1	Semifinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1738_7	Well, I mean, my way to the final's been great. You know, I cannot do much better than this. But I've just been playing consistently well. I wasn't maybe pushed to the degree where I have to say I played my best tennis ever. I just think it's been good tennis so far. You know, if I were to win tomorrow, on Sunday, then maybe I can say I've been playing my best ever. But at the moment I think it's a little bit too early.	1738_7.a	2008-07-04	M	1738	Marat Safin	Roger Federer	Would you say you're playing better than ever this year, right now?	1738_7.q	1.0	1	Semifinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1738_8	Yeah.	1738_8.a	2008-07-04	M	1738	Marat Safin	Roger Federer	Knowing you are a tennis expert, you like to do trivia tennis questions to your colleagues sometime, do you know anything about William Renshaw, the fact he won six times here in a row?	1738_8.q	1.0	1	Semifinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1738_9	No, I haven't studied. He was in the finals every time, so it was a little easier for him to win six in a row. A little different for us. Anyway, look, that's like in the heyday, yeah. Not my focus at the moment.	1738_9.a	2008-07-04	M	1738	Marat Safin	Roger Federer	Have you studied this?	1738_9.q	1.0	1	Semifinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1738_10	Well, I mean, it's gonna be more talk about it, I guess, than normally, you know. But I think Rafa deserves, you know, the respect he has from you guys and from us, the players. I mean, he's definitely had the best start to the season ever. He's been playing well, consistently well. Was a little rocky start maybe in the beginning losing quite comfortably against Youzhny and Tsonga in, you know, where was it, Chennai and Australia. Then I think he really sort of caught himself and played really well. Had one more tough loss against Djokovic at Indian Wells. But from then on, he was playing I think really well, you know. Clay court season was phenomenal again, you know. For me it's just a matter of sort of -- I mean, for me, anyway, that final is out of the picture. I hardly remember anything of it. It went so quickly. Yeah, for me it's not really that big of a problem, maybe like you guys look at it.	1738_10.a	2008-07-04	M	1738	Marat Safin	Roger Federer	Does your tough loss in Paris, presuming Rafa gets into the final, put a little different complexion on the next match?	1738_10.q	1.0	1	Semifinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1738_11	No, I mean, I enjoy the challenge. Geez, I mean, Rafa is a great competitor. I mean, he's got a winning record over me. Every time I play him I want to try to beat him. The thing is, I've played him so often on clay, it's more of an advantage for him in the head-to-heads. At the same time, I mean, he's now become so good on all other surfaces as well that he's a real threat, you know, on anything, you know. That's not only for me, but, you know, for any player. Now, let's see what happens now the rest of the season, because I think this is maybe my favorite part of the season, you know, trying to win Wimbledon and US Open back to back, and we got the Olympics stuck in it, as well. So it's a huge, huge possibility for both, for any players right now. So that's why I think it's an exciting time right now for us.	1738_11.a	2008-07-04	M	1738	Marat Safin	Roger Federer	Is it sort of a pain in the neck for you or something that keeps things interesting that you have a guy so close nipping at your heels, challenging you all the time?	1738_11.q	1.0	1	Semifinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1738_12	No, no, we talk. We see each other all the time in the locker room. So we were talking a lot on the rain delay, you know, when was it, when I was playing. Who was I playing last match?	1738_12.a	2008-07-04	M	1738	Marat Safin	Roger Federer	The women's finalists are obviously playing doubles together. Have you had any interaction with Rafa these last two weeks, or do you stay out of each other's way?	1738_12.q	1.0	1	Semifinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1738_13	Ancic, yeah. We spoke a lot, for instance. So we always see each other all the time at the practice courts. We just get in and out. But, you know, during match days we sort of talk a lot, yeah.	1738_13.a	2008-07-04	M	1738	Marat Safin	Roger Federer	Ancic.	1738_13.q	1.0	1	Semifinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1738_14	I'm not superstitious. I'm no Goran Ivanisevic. No, I'm not like that, you know. Give me a different dish every day, different restaurant, I have no problem. Or even a different bed.	1738_14.a	2008-07-04	M	1738	Marat Safin	Roger Federer	When you come to Wimbledon, do you keep the same routine in terms of where you stay, your restaurants, the time you eat? How superstitious are you?	1738_14.q	1.0	1	Semifinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1738_15	Well, he asked me a couple years ago in I think Madrid or whatever it was. Well, it's obviously intriguing, the same as I would love to play maybe with Roddick. Because I've played with Hewitt in the past; I've played with Safin in the past. I never played with those two guys. It would be something I would consider doing, you know. But playing so little doubles these days, when I play, I want to play with my friend, Yves or Stan or something like that. That's why it's sort of hard. Maybe it will happen.	1738_15.a	2008-07-04	M	1738	Marat Safin	Roger Federer	Have you ever thought to play doubles one day with Rafael Nadal just for fun?	1738_15.q	1.0	1	Semifinals	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3304_0	Was the toughest match probably since the US Open. I mean, I wasn't very satisfied with my performance tonight. I know I wasn't playing on top of my game. But, look, you know, a win is a win in the end. And I knew that my opponent tonight is unpredictable player who has a powerful groundstrokes and great serve. If he's on, you know, if he feels the ball well, it's difficult to, you know, compete with him. That's what happened. I think he made pressure, a lot of pressure, on my serve, especially the second serve. He was stepping in. I went back. I was too passive. But, you know, in the end, it was important to stay in the match and use the chances when they're presented.	3304_0.a	2011-11-21	M	3304	Tomas Berdych	Novak Djokovic	That was a big fight out there. Do you feel maybe it's your best match since winning the US Open?	3304_0.q	1.0	1	Round Robin	BARCLAYS ATP WORLD TOUR FINALS	Masters Cup
3304_1	To be honest, it feels good. You know, that's something that I'm happy about, is my condition. I haven't felt any pain in my shoulder. I've been feeling well on the court. Obviously, I feel a little bit exhausted, you know, because the match was almost three hours. It's normal. But I think I'm physically fit. And I just need to get some things better in my game for the next challenge.	3304_1.a	2011-11-21	M	3304	Tomas Berdych	Novak Djokovic	How does it feel to be back out there after going the distance after all of your injuries that you've had since New York?	3304_1.q	1.0	1	Round Robin	BARCLAYS ATP WORLD TOUR FINALS	Masters Cup
3304_2	I was saying before, you need to be on top of your game each match to win. You have opponents who are top eight in the world. I might have been a favorite on the paper, but I knew that the chances are more or less the same for both of us to win tonight because I haven't been playing my best in maybe month and a half. You know, I struggled a little bit with injuries. I retired a couple of matches. Didn't get a lot of indoor match play, let's say, you know, before this event. And it's been a long season. But, look, maybe this is a good start, you know, to overcome such a test. Hopefully next match will be better.	3304_2.a	2011-11-21	M	3304	Tomas Berdych	Novak Djokovic	Is it the belief, you think, of winning all the matches you've won this season that makes you come through such a tight tussle like that?	3304_2.q	1.0	1	Round Robin	BARCLAYS ATP WORLD TOUR FINALS	Masters Cup
3304_3	Well, 'conditions,' you mean conditions of the court?	3304_3.a	2011-11-21	M	3304	Tomas Berdych	Novak Djokovic	How do you assess the playing conditions? You are a tennis superstar, now you're a worldwide superstar during the summer. Did anything really change in your life? What changed when you became No.1?	3304_3.q	1.0	1	Round Robin	BARCLAYS ATP WORLD TOUR FINALS	Masters Cup
3304_4	Surface is quite slow, to be honest. You know, it's basically the same surface that we've been playing here for last three years. Maybe comparing to Paris, it's quite similar this year. You know, I've been feeling well and comfortable on this surface. I'm sure that I can play even better than I did tonight. But conditions obviously are the same for everybody. On the other hand my approach hasn't changed  a slight bit  to what I do to my profession. My team of people is still the same. We have still the same practice routines and preparations. Okay, it's evident that let's say the approach from the world of sport is different to me because of the success that I had. But I think I'm still handling all these things well. I need to still stay with my both feet on the ground in order to keep doing well. That's what I want. I'm a tennis player. I want to try to win as many majors as I can in the future.	3304_4.a	2011-11-21	M	3304	Tomas Berdych	Novak Djokovic	Yes.	3304_4.q	1.0	1	Round Robin	BARCLAYS ATP WORLD TOUR FINALS	Masters Cup
3304_5	It would mean a lot. It's a crown for all the achievements I had. It would be a fantastic way to end the best season in my career. But look, you know, I need to step up a little bit. I need to raise the level of performance in order to have a chance to go all the way.	3304_5.a	2011-11-21	M	3304	Tomas Berdych	Novak Djokovic	If you could sum up what's been an incredible season for you and what it would mean for you to win this this week?	3304_5.q	1.0	1	Round Robin	BARCLAYS ATP WORLD TOUR FINALS	Masters Cup
3304_6	Yeah, it's bad luck. I don't know exactly what's his condition, but it's been a long season for everybody. You know, it's probably take its toll  maybe for him at the wrong moment. Because I'm sure that everybody wants to see him go all the way here, you know, playing in his home country. Getting a trophy would be a huge win for him and all the people here. But this is another example that there is no big favorites. David Ferrer, Berdych, all these guys, even though they're lower ranked than we are, we all played very close matches. You cannot underestimate anybody. That's why this tournament is so important for all of us.	3304_6.a	2011-11-21	M	3304	Tomas Berdych	Novak Djokovic	Massive disappointment for Andy today. He was unwell, not sure if he's going to continue in the tournament. You've been in that position recently. Do you sympathize with him? Also the home crowd as well for him.	3304_6.q	1.0	1	Round Robin	BARCLAYS ATP WORLD TOUR FINALS	Masters Cup
3304_7	Well, to be honest, if you're thinking too much about what you should do, you know, you're not going to get the right outcome. I guess I'm just trying to take that point as any other, obviously stay focused, depending who is on the serve. You know, at this level, small details and couple of points are deciding a winner, and that was the case tonight. It could easily have gone the other way for him. He stepped it in. Even on the match ball, he was more aggressive, he was going for his shots. I think I was doing well to stay in the point. Just tried to get one ball back more than he did. He made a mistake and I was back in the match.	3304_7.a	2011-11-21	M	3304	Tomas Berdych	Novak Djokovic	When you get into a situation like you're facing a match point, as you did at the US Open, and you did tonight, how do you approach that? Do you feel that you just got to go for it and give it everything? Do you try to take something off your returns? What are your views when you're a match point down?	3304_7.q	1.0	1	Round Robin	BARCLAYS ATP WORLD TOUR FINALS	Masters Cup
2646_0	Jelena was playing a good match today. She didn't make a lot of mistakes, and, you know, I tried to do something. I tried to change it when I saw it was not going way, but, I mean, I just made a few too many errors at the important points. Yeah, I couldn't really get to play the game that I wanted to play. I mean, Jelena took advantage of that and she played a great match.	2646_0.a	2010-03-21	F	2646	Jelena Jankovic	Caroline Wozniacki	Jankovic was very aggressive today. Is there any point where you thought, I've got to do something different or I have to change gears? Did you try to change something that took that away?	2646_0.q	4.0	0	The Final	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
2646_1	I wanted to get her moving a little bit more. I wanted to stay on the baseline a little bit more. But, well, it's the way it went, and it's okay, you know. I just need to get back on the practice court, and there's always next week. Yeah, now I just need to get ready for Miami. Anyways, I had a good week here, or great 10 days. Yeah, now I'm ready and confident to going into Miami.	2646_1.a	2010-03-21	F	2646	Jelena Jankovic	Caroline Wozniacki	What game was that?	2646_1.q	4.0	0	The Final	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
2646_2	No, I don't really feel like I had problems with my forehand or backhand or anything. In general, I just think that, you know, I was making a few too many errors and I didn't have too many first serves in. Normally the other matches I set the points up with my service well. That didn't happen today. Then I was on the back foot and she was deciding.	2646_2.a	2010-03-21	F	2646	Jelena Jankovic	Caroline Wozniacki	You appeared to be having some trouble with your forehand today. Can you talk about what happened with that?	2646_2.q	4.0	0	The Final	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
2646_3	Yeah, she was playing a little bit further inside the court and I went a little bit back. I tried to get in all the time. I tried to, you know, just hang in there and stick -- you know, tried to stick to the court. But, you know, it's just -- it didn't go my way today, unfortunately. Hopefully next time.	2646_3.a	2010-03-21	F	2646	Jelena Jankovic	Caroline Wozniacki	Do you feel like you let her dictate too much today? She was playing a little bit further inside the court.	2646_3.q	4.0	0	The Final	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
2646_4	Well, I don't know. She's a great player, no doubt about that. I don't know if she's a tough matchup for me or if she -- I mean, she's definitely a tough player to beat, and I have to play well to do that. Yeah, today she was playing better than me.	2646_4.a	2010-03-21	F	2646	Jelena Jankovic	Caroline Wozniacki	Do you feel she's a tough matchup for you, just the style she plays and given she's a veteran she knows how to play points pretty well?	2646_4.q	4.0	0	The Final	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
2646_5	Of course I'm always hungry to get that first spot, No.1 spot. That's what everyone is dreaming about. And also winning Grand Slams, that's what everybody wants. So definitely that's also something I want to achieve. Hopefully that will happen one day. I have one spot left. Serena is a great player, and everyone else, also. There are a lot of tough players out there. Just taking one match at a time and doing my best, and we have to see what the future brings.	2646_5.a	2010-03-21	F	2646	Jelena Jankovic	Caroline Wozniacki	In our country, we often say No.1; No.1, that's all that really matters. Now that you're No.2 in the world, how hungry are you to become No.1 to get that top slot?	2646_5.q	4.0	0	The Final	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
2646_6	I just need to keep improving. There are so many things I want to improve. Then we'll have to see if that will be enough.	2646_6.a	2010-03-21	F	2646	Jelena Jankovic	Caroline Wozniacki	And to get there, what do you think you have to do to get to the very top?	2646_6.q	4.0	0	The Final	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
2646_7	I always believe I can win when I go on the court. I always think that I can win the match. I will always be disappointed when I lose. I'm a fighter, and I hate losing. I think that's also what brought me here to this final. I mean, I'm fighting for every point. When you lose, that's a bit disappointing. I just need a little bit of time and I'll be okay.	2646_7.a	2010-03-21	F	2646	Jelena Jankovic	Caroline Wozniacki	You seem pretty disappointed. Did you feel coming into the match that this was maybe one you could win?	2646_7.q	4.0	0	The Final	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
2646_8	It's tough to say, you know. She played definitely a great match today. She has had a great 10 days, as well. Yeah, I mean, I need to congratulate her for the win.	2646_8.a	2010-03-21	F	2646	Jelena Jankovic	Caroline Wozniacki	Do you think that's the best she's played against you?	2646_8.q	4.0	0	The Final	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
2646_9	He just said, You're playing well. Just need to stick to your game. Remember to fight for every point. Then he was trying to say a few things on my toss, on my serve.	2646_9.a	2010-03-21	F	2646	Jelena Jankovic	Caroline Wozniacki	What kind of advice did your coach give you?	2646_9.q	4.0	0	The Final	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
2646_10	Well, I really like playing here. I mean, the US Open was also a great run for me. I like New York. I like the atmosphere there. You know, everything is loud. So many things going on. Here it's so calm. It's quiet. It's nice. It's clean. People are so friendly. I just like being here in the U.S. It feels like being home, like being -- yeah, it's just great.	2646_10.a	2010-03-21	F	2646	Jelena Jankovic	Caroline Wozniacki	You do pretty well in this country. What do you like about the United States? What gets you going?	2646_10.q	4.0	0	The Final	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
2646_11	Yeah, I find it relaxing. I find it really, really homey, you know. I've been staying at this two-bedroom house with a kitchen and everything, so we've also been cooking a little bit. It just makes that home atmosphere that makes it feel great, and want to come back here next year.	2646_11.a	2010-03-21	F	2646	Jelena Jankovic	Caroline Wozniacki	Some of the reporters yesterday were saying that the people are a little bit on the old side, but you enjoy it a lot here. You find it relaxing?	2646_11.q	4.0	0	The Final	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
2646_12	La Quinta.	2646_12.a	2010-03-21	F	2646	Jelena Jankovic	Caroline Wozniacki	What town is that in?	2646_12.q	4.0	0	The Final	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
2646_13	Well, definitely. When I think back on this tournament, I think I've done a great job coming into this tournament. Everyone was playing here except for the two Williams. It was a strong field, and then coming out as a finalist and then coming out as No.2 in the world tomorrow, I mean, that's still a great feeling. I just need a few more hours just to get this loss worked on. I just need to get back on the practice court and get better for next time.	2646_13.a	2010-03-21	F	2646	Jelena Jankovic	Caroline Wozniacki	Is the No.2 ranking any compensation for today's loss?	2646_13.q	4.0	0	The Final	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
2646_14	It's tough to say. Right now I don't know. I think she played a great match. Maybe, you know, it would be different if I would just have gotten one of the first points instead of being down 4-1 from the beginning.	2646_14.a	2010-03-21	F	2646	Jelena Jankovic	Caroline Wozniacki	So if there's anything you could have done differently today, other than just execution, what would that have been?	2646_14.q	4.0	0	The Final	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
2646_15	Two completely different matches. You cannot compare these two. I mean, it's two big tournaments. I was in Grand Slam final, which was amazing for me; and now also being in this final here at Indian Wells, it was great. Of course I'd have loved to have won both of them, but it didn't happen. I just need to get better for next time. It was two completely different matches, two different completely different opponents.	2646_15.a	2010-03-21	F	2646	Jelena Jankovic	Caroline Wozniacki	Can you compare today's final with last year's US Open final? Looks like it was easier for you to play with Clijsters than today with Jankovic. Do you agree?	2646_15.q	4.0	0	The Final	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
3532_0	Well, Vera is playing a very good match. She played at a very high level. I had my chances, had quite a few breakpoints. I didn't convert, and then I lost the match. But, you know, I really tried to do my best out there. I was fighting. You know, today Vera just played better than me.	3532_0.a	2011-02-26	F	3532	Vera Zvonareva	Caroline Wozniacki	Excellent seven days and finally this. What went wrong today?	3532_0.q	1.0	0	The Final	QATAR LADIES OPEN	International
3532_1	Yes, it was very small things that does it. At this level you need to take the chances that you have. It's a final. I really did my best today. It wasn't enough. Still, it was a pretty good week where I've been sick and still made it to the finals. Today I felt actually much better. You know, I'm just happy to have been in the finals and another good week for me.	3532_1.a	2011-02-26	F	3532	Vera Zvonareva	Caroline Wozniacki	Is it possible to know what was the small little difference between both players today? Because it was so tough and so tense.	3532_1.q	1.0	0	The Final	QATAR LADIES OPEN	International
3532_2	Yeah, she came back. That's what happens. We were fighting for every point, every game, and it was close, but it went her way today.	3532_2.a	2011-02-26	F	3532	Vera Zvonareva	Caroline Wozniacki	You lead 2-love in the second set. You looked to go in front of you, but she come back.	3532_2.q	1.0	0	The Final	QATAR LADIES OPEN	International
3532_3	Well, I'm playing Indian Wells and Miami, so I'm looking forward to these two tournaments. Right now I'm just gonna take a few days and take it easy, and we'll see what happens.	3532_3.a	2011-02-26	F	3532	Vera Zvonareva	Caroline Wozniacki	You have been playing nonstop since the start of the season. Do you think you need a break now?	3532_3.q	1.0	0	The Final	QATAR LADIES OPEN	International
2375_0	You know, be to be honest, I really don't know. It's really amazing. I couldn't believe, you know, that I was able to win this match at the end. There was so many ups and down throughout the match. I had I don't know, 5-4 and three match points on my serve, and I thought I was gonna win right there. And then all of a sudden, she was going for broke on those points and she took her chances. It was tough for me to except that I lost that game. But then I just tried to refocus again and play the best that I can even though I was really tired and it was tough and we were there for three hours. Then all of a sudden I got into a situation down 6-2 in the tiebreak, and I just said to myself, you know, I have been in these kind of situations in the past. I know I can win. I just have to go one point at a time and move the best as I can, even if I have to move on my hands or whatever I had to do. I just gave everything I had. It was really tough. To be honest, I don't know how I was able to win those points and win the tiebreak. It's a really unbelievable win for me in such a tough match. It was tough mentally and physically for both of us.	2375_0.a	2009-08-15	F	2375	Elena Dementieva	Jelena Jankovic	How did you pull that out?	2375_0.q	5.0	1	Semifinals	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP WOMEN'S OPEN	Premier
2375_1	I was tight. My legs were hurting, everything was hurting. It was a three-hour match, and I haven't played many matches this year. It's not the same practicing -- you can practice eight hours, but when you're under pressure and when you're competing, it takes much more energy out of you. I felt that. I cannot lie about that. But I tried to make myself think that I'm still fresh and I still have, you know, energy to keep going and keep going and keep going. Here I am. I came out as a winner. It's a really huge win for me and great for my confidence. It's been a while since I played a final of a big tournament, and it's good to be back.	2375_1.a	2009-08-15	F	2375	Elena Dementieva	Jelena Jankovic	Were you cramping? I saw you bending over a lot.	2375_1.q	5.0	1	Semifinals	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP WOMEN'S OPEN	Premier
2375_2	Second set I got so tired. You know, I tried my best in the first set, and it look a lot of energy out of me. Second set I fell completely flat. I said to myself, you know, I have no chance to win that second set. She was playing really well. She was going for her shots, and I didn't have enough energy. I was hitting everything short and I let her dictate the play. I said, I'm just going to just try to gain as much energy as possible and start in a good way in the third. That's what I did. I started attacking right away and giving everything I had. You know, I kept going, going, going. Really, really took so much out of me mentally and physically. I cannot believe -- there were so many things going on out there. It was unbelievable that I was able to win this. She was in much better form coming into this match, you know, but I had a good score against her in the past. She has had the better year this year, so obviously she was the favorite. But, you know, I was the No.1 player last year, and, you know, sometimes I can come up and give it a good go.	2375_2.a	2009-08-15	F	2375	Elena Dementieva	Jelena Jankovic	Looked like almost several different matches tonight. What happened in the second set?	2375_2.q	5.0	1	Semifinals	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP WOMEN'S OPEN	Premier
2375_3	Yeah, it's nice to make up for this. It's been a while. I've been waiting for this. You know, I had all these problems as well. You know, my mother was sick and she had surgery. I had so many distractions outside of the court. I wasn't able to -- I'm quite an emotional person, and I wasn't able to focus. It took a lot out of me. My tennis was going down and I didn't enjoy it. I didn't enjoy those battles like I did today, even though sometimes I played not so well and then I played well. You know, I still enjoyed the whole situation. I was out there and believing that I can do it and I had fun. That's the most important thing. Now I'm enjoying and enjoying the challenge. I'm happy that I have this opportunity to play matches again. I love competing, and that's what I'm here for. It's been a while since I been deep in the competition. This is what I want, and this is where I belong. I hope that I can continue like this.	2375_3.a	2009-08-15	F	2375	Elena Dementieva	Jelena Jankovic	Does this result, the way you won, make up for a lot of disappointing results you've had?	2375_3.q	5.0	1	Semifinals	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP WOMEN'S OPEN	Premier
2375_4	I told you at the end of that second set, I said to myself, you know, I didn't want to run so much for some of shots. I didn't want to try my best. I said, Okay, I'm just gonna let it go and try to feel better for the beginning of the third. Then I started -- you know, I lifted my game a little bit and got a bit more energy. Then I didn't want to, you know, try so hard if I didn't have energy. Then I would be completely dead and then I would ruin everything and I wouldn't be able to do anything. So I kind of did -- that's how I managed. It was difficult. It was not easy to run side to side and play all the long points. It's so humid. Elena played so well. She's an unbelievable athlete and makes you play all the shots and doesn't give you easy points. You have to earn everything. You know, I'm really happy that I was able to beat her tonight?	2375_4.a	2009-08-15	F	2375	Elena Dementieva	Jelena Jankovic	Given your fatigue level, what did you tell yourself mentally at the end of the second set? You got bageled, basically. How did you get back into it in the third set?	2375_4.q	5.0	1	Semifinals	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP WOMEN'S OPEN	Premier
2375_5	That will be a little bit disadvantage. Safina played today at 1:00 and had the whole day to rest. I finished late tonight. I will do my best to recover. I will try, you know, my best to play well tomorrow.	2375_5.a	2009-08-15	F	2375	Elena Dementieva	Jelena Jankovic	Looking at the match tomorrow, I mean, you have a very short recovery time. What do you have to do to win tomorrow?	2375_5.q	5.0	1	Semifinals	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP WOMEN'S OPEN	Premier
2375_6	Yeah, we'll do everything possible. We'll see how I will be tomorrow. It will be a difficult match. It's a tough opponent. We'll see how things go. Anything can happen.	2375_6.a	2009-08-15	F	2375	Elena Dementieva	Jelena Jankovic	Will you take fluids or something like that?	2375_6.q	5.0	1	Semifinals	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP WOMEN'S OPEN	Premier
2375_7	She's doing good. Thank you. She had surgery after Wimbledon and she's recovering. Hopefully she will come in New York, so I'm really happy about that. You know, I can enjoy my tennis. I'm happy for my mom. There's nothing more important than health.	2375_7.a	2009-08-15	F	2375	Elena Dementieva	Jelena Jankovic	How is your mother's health right now?	2375_7.q	5.0	1	Semifinals	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP WOMEN'S OPEN	Premier
2375_8	What do you mean, at the end?	2375_8.a	2009-08-15	F	2375	Elena Dementieva	Jelena Jankovic	What was the difference today? Was it just you were the last person standing? Did you feel maybe more fit than Dementieva?	2375_8.q	5.0	1	Semifinals	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP WOMEN'S OPEN	Premier
2375_9	There was very little. The difference was few points here and there. It was unbelievable. You know, you couldn't decide. It was -- I don't know how I was able to win. I thought she felt more fit than I was. I was struggling with my -- you know, I was struggling with fatigue. I was giving my best trying not to think about that and trying to think in the present and play each point one point at a time and fight and give ever atom of my power. You know, it was difficult. I thought that she had enough energy, but it was very tough mentally to handle the whole situation. It's not easy.	2375_9.a	2009-08-15	F	2375	Elena Dementieva	Jelena Jankovic	Because it was a very tough, long match. What was the difference in the match?	2375_9.q	5.0	1	Semifinals	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP WOMEN'S OPEN	Premier
2375_10	It's better not to talk about this now. I'm just so happy I won my match.	2375_10.a	2009-08-15	F	2375	Elena Dementieva	Jelena Jankovic	Can you say what kind of sickness your mother had?	2375_10.q	5.0	1	Semifinals	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP WOMEN'S OPEN	Premier
2375_11	Yeah, but it's been a while since I played well. Last time was at the end of last year when I played finals at the Open and won three big tournaments in the row and was beating all the top players at a lot of big tournaments. All these things happened, and my game completely dropped down. It was difficult to accept that. All of the players were favorites against me, even though I had a positive score against them. When I saw -- it gave me kind of a little bit of motivation, to be honest. I know I can do it. I know I can play well and bring some good tennis out there. I know I'm a good athlete. It's just a matter of believing in myself and doing what I can do best. I showed tonight I was able to handle the situation and come out as a winner, even though it was tough and a lot of ups and downs.	2375_11.a	2009-08-15	F	2375	Elena Dementieva	Jelena Jankovic	Do you feel like that person who was No.1 at the beginning of year, that that was forever ago? I mean, there are probably people that don't even remember that.	2375_11.q	5.0	1	Semifinals	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP WOMEN'S OPEN	Premier
2375_12	No. There was a lot of things I could have done better. I didn't serve so well. I didn't put many first serves in and made a lot of double faults. There are so many things I have to improve. There is -- it's not always gonna be perfect. But still, in those situations when things are not going the way you want them to go, you still have to figure out a way to get through. Doesn't matter how. Do whatever you can do. Try to find a way to win. I was able to do that tonight.	2375_12.a	2009-08-15	F	2375	Elena Dementieva	Jelena Jankovic	Were you happy with the way you served?	2375_12.q	5.0	1	Semifinals	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP WOMEN'S OPEN	Premier
2375_13	Yeah.	2375_13.a	2009-08-15	F	2375	Elena Dementieva	Jelena Jankovic	You said that at the end you were telling yourself that, I feel fresh, I feel fresh.	2375_13.q	5.0	1	Semifinals	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP WOMEN'S OPEN	Premier
2375_14	Well, you know, the way it works, whatever you tell to yourself, your body follows. I mean, how you say it in -- (from translation) power of suggestion. Whatever you say to yourself -- if you say to yourself, I'm so nervous I can't go anymore, you're gonna be even worse. You got to keep feeding your mind with positive things and words and just keep pushing yourself to the limits. I just kept going and going and said, Jelena, keep going, keep going. I didn't want to think too far. 6-2 and I didn't want to think, I'm going down. I'm gonna lose. I took one point at a time, and that's the way I managed to win this match.	2375_14.a	2009-08-15	F	2375	Elena Dementieva	Jelena Jankovic	How did you convince yourself when that you body is telling you otherwise?	2375_14.q	5.0	1	Semifinals	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP WOMEN'S OPEN	Premier
2375_15	One of the toughest, for sure. You know, it was tough mentally and physically, especially in this time of the year, you know. I been looking for this kind of matches. For my confidence it's really unbelievable. It's a good comeback for me. It's good to get in this group again, you know, be with the top players again and compete with them hopefully week in and week out. That's what I want. That's my goal for now.	2375_15.a	2009-08-15	F	2375	Elena Dementieva	Jelena Jankovic	In your career, would you rank this match as being one of the toughest?	2375_15.q	5.0	1	Semifinals	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP WOMEN'S OPEN	Premier
2375_16	After Wimbledon, I completely, you know, rested my mind. I wanted to forget everything what happened in that first half of the season. I wanted to clear my mind and be -- start the second half of the season with a fresh mind and ready to play. I changed a lot of things. I changed -- my body changed as well. I lost some weight and became more lean, which at this beginning of year I had 15 pounds more weight than usual. That gave my trouble and I felt awkward on court. There's lots of things that I have changed. I'm much more positive now and enjoying every practice and every match. I'm trying my best to improve every day. You know, there is things I would like to get better at and work on certain shots, but with the positive mind, I think you can achieve anything. The most important is I'm enjoying. I'm playing with passion, which -- and with a smile on my face. That's what I needed. I been missing that for a while. I wasn't the same player.	2375_16.a	2009-08-15	F	2375	Elena Dementieva	Jelena Jankovic	You mentioned that you haven't been playing that much this year. That has taken a little bit of that confidence. How will you see yourself looking ahead to the US Open? Are you prepared for that? Are you prepared to be a Grand Slam champion?	2375_16.q	5.0	1	Semifinals	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP WOMEN'S OPEN	Premier
2375_17	Tomorrow it's gonna be another match. Soon as I step on the court tomorrow, I will forget everything that has happened in this tournament. I just have to focus on what I can do to play against Safina. That's all. There is nothing else. I gotta try my best. Nobody is unbeatable out there.	2375_17.a	2009-08-15	F	2375	Elena Dementieva	Jelena Jankovic	How does pulling through a tough match tonight help you tomorrow?	2375_17.q	5.0	1	Semifinals	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP WOMEN'S OPEN	Premier
2375_18	I didn't really follow. To be honest, when I'm out, on vacation or not playing tennis, I don't really watch women's tennis, or even men's matches. I just want to stay out of tennis and recharge the batteries and think about something else other than hitting balls and all these things that go long with tennis.	2375_18.a	2009-08-15	F	2375	Elena Dementieva	Jelena Jankovic	During the break after Wimbledon, how much did you follow the tour?	2375_18.q	5.0	1	Semifinals	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP WOMEN'S OPEN	Premier
2375_19	Shopping, beach, whatever. Taking care of my mother as well.	2375_19.a	2009-08-15	F	2375	Elena Dementieva	Jelena Jankovic	Shop?	2375_19.q	5.0	1	Semifinals	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP WOMEN'S OPEN	Premier
777_0	Not yet.  Maybe tomorrow morning when I wake up, because it's the best match of my life. To beat this guy here in Rome is the biggest emotion I've ever felt.  This is a great emotion for me.	777_0.a	2007-05-10	M	777	Roger Federer	Filippo Volandri	You're playing the match.  You're winning.  But are you believing it?	777_0.q	53.0	1	3rd Round	INTERNAZIONALI BNL D'ITALIA (MEN)	Masters
777_1	Absolutely.  That's the meaning of play here in Rome with the crowd, with all the people supporting you.  It's really a part of game, because he help me so much.	777_1.a	2007-05-10	M	777	Roger Federer	Filippo Volandri	What does did do when you here Fil-li-ppo, Po-, Po?  Does it jack you up?	777_1.q	53.0	1	3rd Round	INTERNAZIONALI BNL D'ITALIA (MEN)	Masters
3080_0	Yeah, a few times (smiling). It's normal. He played well. Was it in the third I was down Love-40 in that one game? I'm not sure. That was the moment I felt was the toughest because if I wouldn't have come out of that game, I don't think I would have broken the next one. I had more belief I was going to break him in the fourth. So it was a tough match, you know. He played really well and I struggled early on, but came through, which is most important.	3080_0.a	2010-06-21	M	3080	Alejandro Falla	Roger Federer	Nice escape, Roger. Did it occur to you at any point in that match you were going to lose?	3080_0.q	2.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3080_1	I just felt I started to hit the ball better. Was an awkward break in the first game of the fourth. I should have never been broken there. But I started to feel my backhand was, you know, starting to be there. I started to pick his serve much better, which has sort of always been the case every time I played him. Today, for some reason, I wasn't able to read his serve. That really rattled me. So I had to look for that for a long time. Thank God I found it eventually.	3080_1.a	2010-06-21	M	3080	Alejandro Falla	Roger Federer	Why did you have more belief the second time?	3080_1.q	2.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3080_2	Well, I think I've been unlucky enough this already this season, so I needed one lucky match. We'll see how important it is, depending on the run I go on now. I've lost a few matches this season with match points, 7-5 or 7-6 in the third. This is definitely some kind of a match I kind of needed. You know, you can't win them all when they're that close, because they're being played on a couple of points here or there. One thing for sure you can do is push the luck on your side. That's not something I have been doing maybe enough the last few months. I'm happy today I gave myself a chance. Maybe some think I should have never put myself in that position. But he played well. He's unconventional. He doesn't look like much, but he definitely plays very solid and plays very uncomfortable. So I knew that from the start. I wasn't going to underestimate him even though I just beat him 6-1, 6-2 in Halle. I think he played terrific. He made it hard for me today.	3080_2.a	2010-06-21	M	3080	Alejandro Falla	Roger Federer	When you win matches like that, do you consider yourself more lucky, more good, winning on mind, or do you consider that the opponent was probably trembling a bit, weak? Mixed feelings?	3080_2.q	2.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3080_3	Well, that's your job to find out the stats. It's not my job to remember (laughter). But I don't think it's definitely happened in many years or ever that I've come back from two sets to Love down in a first round. So that's not the last six years, because I don't remember going through five sets in a first round. It was eventually going to happen. I'm happy, you know, I found a way to win today even though it was a tough match and a tough start for me, because he did offer me opportunities already in the first and second set which I wasn't able to take. It was frustrating, to say the least. I hung tough and came through. So you have to look at the stats and find your story there.	3080_3.a	2010-06-21	M	3080	Alejandro Falla	Roger Federer	During your six-year streak of going far in majors, how many matches have you had like this, this early, where you felt as though you could lose?	3080_3.q	2.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3080_4	Well, yeah, like I said, it hasn't happened I'm sure the last six years. So it's not something I'm used you. You definitely feel, you know, uncomfortable because if you're used to being down the whole time your whole life, it's something that's kind of normal. For me it's not normal to be down two sets to Love, especially at Wimbledon, and early on in Grand Slams. It's something I'm not quite used to. But still I was able to find a way. That's most important right now. Doesn't matter how I felt out there. Didn't feel great, that's for sure.	3080_4.a	2010-06-21	M	3080	Alejandro Falla	Roger Federer	But how unusual were the feelings that you had during this match for you, especially here at Wimbledon?	3080_4.q	2.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3080_5	Scores are set back to 0-0 when I start the match. That's a good thing. So we'll see how it goes.	3080_5.a	2010-06-21	M	3080	Alejandro Falla	Roger Federer	How are you thinking about the rest of the tournament coming up?	3080_5.q	2.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3080_6	For those who saw the French Open match, he served for the set in the first set. People that obviously only remember straight sets don't remember I actually played him. He was playing really well there, as well, taking huge chances on second serves. Obviously on clay that's even easier. It was slow. It was rainy. We had to come off the court once. I knew he could hang from the baseline. In Halle, I think there were too many bad bounces so he couldn't work with his half volleys. I was really mixing it up well, playing well, reading his serve terrific. That was something that was different today. But in Paris I did have feelings against him that he was very uncomfortable to play against, even though I think I've had probably the fastest match in my Grand Slam career against him here on Court 1, like in 55 minutes I was able to beat him. I think if you can overpower him, everything goes your way, he's a guy you can put away very quickly. Once you get tangled up in the rallies, it's very difficult. He has a great forehand, good backhand, moves well. I think he's improved his serve, to be honest. He's a tough player. Great talent. Good junior before. He's got the right potential.	3080_6.a	2010-06-21	M	3080	Alejandro Falla	Roger Federer	How do you think he was able to stay with you so well in the rallies? You said afterwards he neutralized you.	3080_6.q	2.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3080_7	Well, the thing here, there's no bad bounces. You can just stick at the baseline, half volley, not panic when a guy moves in. You can always flick it at the end. Obviously they're not the fastest courts anymore. Depends obviously how you play, as well. If you've got a massive serve and you can just outright overpower a guy, then obviously it's fast. But a guy who is that agile at the baseline like Falla makes it very difficult to play against, because he can neutralize you, plays a flat ball, doesn't miss much. You've got to take chances. Today the chances I took were not working.	3080_7.a	2010-06-21	M	3080	Alejandro Falla	Roger Federer	How did you find the speed of the court?	3080_7.q	2.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3080_8	Well, I mean, sort of, 4-All, Love-40, yeah. I mean, I think also the points that leaded up to Love-40 were not very convincing for me. I think I missed a forehand, missed a backhand, maybe even started with a double-fault. My whole game was sort of in disarray. I was just hoping that I get three quick serves to come back. But I had to come up with some passing shots, some scrambling shots. Didn't always get the first serve in. There was definitely a bit of luck involved there, you know. It's normal when the chances he had, the way I came out of this match, you know, definitely got lucky. But that's how it goes sometimes.	3080_8.a	2010-06-21	M	3080	Alejandro Falla	Roger Federer	You said the ability to learn never to panic helped you jump-start your champion career. Was there a moment where you sort of panicked today?	3080_8.q	2.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3080_9	When?	3080_9.a	2010-06-21	M	3080	Alejandro Falla	Roger Federer	The momentum seemed to swing in the first set when it was 5-All. You had that distraction, you were about to serve. The ball boy came across. The umpire stopped the match.	3080_9.q	2.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3080_10	I don't remember what happened.	3080_10.a	2010-06-21	M	3080	Alejandro Falla	Roger Federer	5-All in the first set.	3080_10.q	2.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3080_11	Didn't I get a first serve because of it? Should have worked my way (laughter). I was about to hit -- it looked like it maybe, but I didn't take advantage of it because I think I was about to hit a second serve and I got a first serve, which is a good thing. But messed the first serve up, had to hit another second serve, like an idiot. But, look, no, I don't remember that being any turning point. He played a good game. My serve was on and off. He took his chances well in the beginning.	3080_11.a	2010-06-21	M	3080	Alejandro Falla	Roger Federer	You were about to serve.	3080_11.q	2.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3080_12	Yeah, walking on down the corridor, onto Centre Court, sure, there's always nerves involved. I kind of want that, you know, because it means the world to me to open Centre Court. It's a dream for any player to play opening day on the perfect grass court. When I walked out for the warmup, I'm like, This court is amazing. I don't remember it ever being so perfect, you know. Then once you get the first couple of service games underway, I think my first game was fine during the match, then it's fine. I wasn't particularly nervous once the match started. Just the regular.	3080_12.a	2010-06-21	M	3080	Alejandro Falla	Roger Federer	Any question of nerves because it's the first match? Was there a nervous factor?	3080_12.q	2.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3080_13	No, I mean, I was being calm because I knew I had to be concentrated on trying to read his game. And in the past actually I've always kind of struggled in the first set here at Wimbledon on opening day. Many times I've been down a break in all the six or seven times I've opened the court. I've been down a couple times a break. I remember that going into the match. Maybe I was playing a little bit careful. But I was playing the right way. I had a couple of breakpoint chances, everything looking fine. Then there was this one game at 5-All which then turned the match for me.	3080_13.a	2010-06-21	M	3080	Alejandro Falla	Roger Federer	It looked like your level of energy was very low. Was that the feeling you had, too?	3080_13.q	2.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3080_14	Not too bad actually. I think, I mean, they were waiting for something to happen, for me to make my move. It's usually how the crowd is, you know, when I'm down. You know, I was happy I had a couple of good points to come back into the match. Then it was obviously thriller atmosphere, which was great for me, making him a little nervous, too. I think I was able to go get the victory. He didn't just donate it to me. That also makes me feel good, because at the end I did play a great fifth set. Nobody will talk about that, I know. People will say he was tired, he choked already way before. I did play a great fifth set. I was able to read his serve. I was starting to play great with my backhand. Things were really clicking in the end.	3080_14.a	2010-06-21	M	3080	Alejandro Falla	Roger Federer	Do you sense the crowd sort of panicking a bit for you?	3080_14.q	2.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3080_15	I think you got to be - how do you say - realistic saying like there was a big threat today. I did get lucky today. It's important to take - how do you say - the right things out of this match. There was positives and negatives, obviously. But then again every player, thank God, in some ways plays different. The next guy is a righty, big-serving guy, nothing to do with the guy I played today. Because you struggle today doesn't mean you're going to struggle in the next match, too. Same thing if you win in straights; it doesn't mean you're going to win the next match in straights. That's just the way tennis is. That's why you're happy sometimes you get over the finish line and have a chance to play much better maybe or play a different kind of a player. That's what I'm going to get for sure in the next round.	3080_15.a	2010-06-21	M	3080	Alejandro Falla	Roger Federer	What carries over for you moving forward? That fifth set or the struggles earlier?	3080_15.q	2.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3080_16	It shouldn't have, no, especially after Halle. He should have known that I was going to beat him. But he forgot I beat him (smiling). Look, he played a great match. I think he gave himself an incredible look. I told him at the net, I hope he's not too disappointed because I thought he played great. Maybe I didn't play obviously the match of my life, but I did play not bad myself at times. That normally is enough to go through in straight or in four sets, but he definitely pushed me. He was a very tough opponent.	3080_16.a	2010-06-21	M	3080	Alejandro Falla	Roger Federer	Do you think it might have helped you to play him three times in a row?	3080_16.q	2.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3080_17	Good. I can come back anytime. I'm a member. I can be a dad anytime at Wimbledon now. It's great being here with the kids and Mirka after last year's time where she was pregnant. It's nice to be back as a family. Even two, you guys didn't know that, so that's nice.	3080_17.a	2010-06-21	M	3080	Alejandro Falla	Roger Federer	What's it like being a dad at Wimbledon?	3080_17.q	2.0	1	1st Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3054_0	Yeah, it was good. I got off to a good start. I was on his serve from the start. You know, able to put pressure on him. The way he played was pretty much how I expected him to play. He can come up with some great stuff out there and some loose points as well. It's a matter of just hanging on, giving a hundred percent in every point 'cause even when he's 40-15 up, you can still get out of one of those games. So, yeah, for the most part I played pretty well.	3054_0.a	2010-06-23	M	3054	nan	Lleyton Hewitt	Was that a day when things went as well as they could have in terms of tactics and the way you executed?	3054_0.q	26.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3054_1	Yeah, yeah, I played a clean match, a smart match. I served well. Hit my spots really well where I wanted to today. Yeah, that was important because when he got an opportunity to have a swing, especially if I didn't get a high enough percentage of first serves in, that was going to make life tougher. I was pretty happy when I did it.	3054_1.a	2010-06-23	M	3054	nan	Lleyton Hewitt	Seven unforced errors. You must be pretty happy with your efficiency, too.	3054_1.q	26.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3054_2	Yeah, well when he called the trainer, he actually served all right just the game before that. I didn't really know a hundred percent why he was actually calling the trainer in the first place. It wasn't that bad because he actually waited till the next changeover. So must have gone downhill very quickly for him to be able to pull out.	3054_2.a	2010-06-23	M	3054	nan	Lleyton Hewitt	When you see an opponent break down physically like that, do you get any pleasure out of that, any kind of satisfaction?	3054_2.q	26.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3054_3	It's a different match to today. Different to my first round as well. He loves a target. He moves extremely well. Probably moves a bit better on clay and hard court than grass. But, yeah, he's obviously got a big wingspan out there, good first serve. So it's a matter of, you know, going out there and still playing my game. I think I'll match up pretty well if I can go out and execute what I want to do.	3054_3.a	2010-06-23	M	3054	nan	Lleyton Hewitt	You've had a couple of long battles with Monfils. What do you need to do to beat him?	3054_3.q	26.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3054_4	I don't think so. I think once we get out there, yeah, we've played a couple times, I think he knows my game reasonably well and I know his pretty well. Once we're out there, it's going to be a different match because it's on grass, and I think that's going to be the biggest, you know, hopefully telling point.	3054_4.a	2010-06-23	M	3054	nan	Lleyton Hewitt	Does the fact that Roger Rasheed has been involved with you both give any significance to the next one?	3054_4.q	26.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3054_5	No, no.	3054_5.a	2010-06-23	M	3054	nan	Lleyton Hewitt	Did you sense any tension out in the crowd considering that England was playing at the same time?	3054_5.q	26.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3054_6	Yeah, I will. Nice I finished a bit earlier than a couple days ago. Yeah, it will be good.	3054_6.a	2010-06-23	M	3054	nan	Lleyton Hewitt	Are you going to watch Australia tonight?	3054_6.q	26.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3054_7	No, I won't have any beers. No, not tonight.	3054_7.a	2010-06-23	M	3054	nan	Lleyton Hewitt	Have a couple of beers?	3054_7.q	26.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3054_8	Yeah, at the moment.	3054_8.a	2010-06-23	M	3054	nan	Lleyton Hewitt	All business?	3054_8.q	26.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
3054_9	Yeah, the first match was physically long points out there. It's always hard the first five-setter on grass, I think. But I bounced back well today. Obviously, today didn't take a whole heap out of me, which is good. Moving forward, you know, if you can keep doing that, putting yourself in a position where you feel good in the second week, it makes life a lot easier.	3054_9.a	2010-06-23	M	3054	nan	Lleyton Hewitt	Are you pleased physically to be getting a reasonably easy run so far?	3054_9.q	26.0	1	2nd Round	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
2654_0	Yeah, exactly. Try and look at the positives. It was a great week, but today definitely didn't play anywhere close to as well as what I can. Really just, I guess, got frustrated and wasn't able to pull it back. When you're a set down against a quality player, it's always tough to come back.	2654_0.a	2010-03-19	F	2654	Jelena Jankovic	Samantha Stosur	Difficult day, but good week, right?	2654_0.q	11.0	0	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
2654_1	Um, well, I started out really well. I think when I lost that service game from 40-Love up, then all the frustration and anger built up and I let that carry on too long. Even though I lost that game, I was still well and truly in the match, but I just -- I don't think I gave myself the opportunity to try and get into it or get back into it as quickly as what I needed to.	2654_1.a	2010-03-19	F	2654	Jelena Jankovic	Samantha Stosur	What was the difference today?	2654_1.q	11.0	0	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
2654_2	My arm was just aching quite a lot. I've had it before. Usually some Tylenol fixes it. That's really what I wanted, but they just really wanted to assess it.	2654_2.a	2010-03-19	F	2654	Jelena Jankovic	Samantha Stosur	So what happened earlier on when you called for the trainer? Was it something to do with your shoulder or neck?	2654_2.q	11.0	0	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
2654_3	Well, I mean, I think everyone knows that her backhand is better than her forehand. She hits through the lines quite a lot, but I just needed to try and keep getting to her weakness. I don't think my footwork or anything was really good enough today to allow me to do that, given that she hits the ball. You know, not a lot of girls play like that. I needed to have much better footwork, and, you know, patience than what I did today. I mean, I knew what I wanted to do out there. I just didn't implement it or give myself a chance.	2654_3.a	2010-03-19	F	2654	Jelena Jankovic	Samantha Stosur	What was your strategy against Jankovic going into this match?	2654_3.q	11.0	0	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
2654_4	No, I actually felt really good. I don't know. I think as soon as you get a little bit frustrated or agitated about yourself, then that's probably the first thing that kind of drops off. Then before you know it, you're a step behind the ball and totally getting dictated to.	2654_4.a	2010-03-19	F	2654	Jelena Jankovic	Samantha Stosur	Were you a little bit tired?	2654_4.q	11.0	0	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
2654_5	Oh, it's been a great week. I've played four really good matches. Today was a bit disappointing, but, you know, it's still my best result in a tournament like this. I think there's a lot to build on. You know, again, I've got to look at the positives and know that I was able to do all those good things for the whole start of the week. It let me down today, but you can try and improve it next week, which is a good thing about tennis.	2654_5.a	2010-03-19	F	2654	Jelena Jankovic	Samantha Stosur	What do you take away from these few days, week and a half?	2654_5.q	11.0	0	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
242_0	Well, I think it was a good match, no? Only one bad game in the whole match, I think, 54 with my serve in the first set. The rest was a positive match I think. Not easy conditions today, no? A lot of wind. A player who don't want to play a lot of points from the baseline, so just try to play the points shorter, so going to the net, playing with the slice. Was not an easy opponent to start. Happy the way I managed the match. As I say, only that game, 54 with my serve, in the first set. The rest was very positive.	242_0.a	2015-08-12	M	242	Sergiy Stakhovsky	Rafael Nadal	How is it to get back in your rhythm on that surface?	242_0.q	9.0	1	2nd Round	COUPE ROGERS	Masters 1000
242_1	I make a mistake. I think he's going to the other side. The first smash was the one that I had to win. The next few smashes were not easy because was a lot of wind out there. The ball was coming so high. I was happy that I didn't miss (smiling). Then he was quick on serving those balls. In general I played a good tiebreak, I think. In the second set, I played a good tennis.	242_1.a	2015-08-12	M	242	Sergiy Stakhovsky	Rafael Nadal	Early in the tiebreaker, you had that exchange where you had a couple chances for the big killer overhead smash. Your opponent stayed alive. Does having the opportunity for those plays bring out the beast or killer instinct in you?	242_1.q	9.0	1	2nd Round	COUPE ROGERS	Masters 1000
242_2	I don't prefer nothing (smiling). I prefer to be here with a victory; doesn't matter the way. Important thing is winning. You have another opportunity tomorrow. The same time this is a part of the season that I won zero points last year. Every match that I won are points that I add to the computer for my ranking. That's important for me today. So every victory is important for me. That was a good one. Let's try tomorrow.	242_2.a	2015-08-12	M	242	Sergiy Stakhovsky	Rafael Nadal	Do you prefer starting with a tougher match like that or starting with an easier match? Is it easier to find your groove with a tougher opponent like that?	242_2.q	9.0	1	2nd Round	COUPE ROGERS	Masters 1000
242_3	Disappointing year? The year is obviously the worst year since couple years ago. But the year is not finished, so...	242_3.a	2015-08-12	M	242	Sergiy Stakhovsky	Rafael Nadal	It's been a disappointing year for you so far by your high standards.	242_3.q	9.0	1	2nd Round	COUPE ROGERS	Masters 1000
242_4	I don't know if I have a chance at the US Open. I don't know if I have a chance here or not. The only thing that I know is that all the ups and downs I had during the whole season, the line is positive, no? Is not up and down with negative line. Since the beginning of the season I think my level of tennis has been still up and down, but during the whole season was little bit higher level, no? That's important for me. I go day by day. Today is a victory that I am happy with. I satisfied the way that I played. I am practicing well. I am practicing more than ever now because I am healthy and because I feel that's what I need today. I won in Hamburg a couple weeks ago. That was an important victory here. Six consecutive victories, didn't happen that very often during the season. That's a positive moment for me. Let's try to continue with that moment tomorrow.	242_4.a	2015-08-12	M	242	Sergiy Stakhovsky	Rafael Nadal	Do you feel with a deep run here you have a chance at the US Open?	242_4.q	9.0	1	2nd Round	COUPE ROGERS	Masters 1000
242_5	No, no, no. Not at all, no. Seriously, when I go to every tournament, I don't think about if I have to defend or if I don't have to defend nothing. I go to the tournament with the motivation to play a good tournament and to win as many matches as possible, no? But is obvious during the rest of the season I don't have to defend nothing. Every good result that I have will add some points to the computer for me. That will help. It's tougher, the tournaments, when you are outside of the top four or top eight. The tournaments can be much tougher. You are not seeded high. So is important for me stay seeded in a good position for the next tournaments.	242_5.a	2015-08-12	M	242	Sergiy Stakhovsky	Rafael Nadal	This is the second time this week that you mentioned not having any points in the computer from last year. How does that make you feel? Does it make you feel a little bit more relaxed knowing that you don't have any points to defend?	242_5.q	9.0	1	2nd Round	COUPE ROGERS	Masters 1000
242_6	I do what I feel is better for my tennis. I feel that, you know, normally before tournaments I practice two hours. Here I arrived on Thursday, so I practiced Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday three hours every day. So more than usual. Playing doubles here helps to get more adapt to the hard court, with returns, with fast movements. That's why I am playing doubles here.	242_6.a	2015-08-12	M	242	Sergiy Stakhovsky	Rafael Nadal	On a day when you have a singles match and a doubles match, I saw your practice this morning, it looked like a hard, long session. Do you believe that work ethic gets you back to No.1 or are there people saying that you don't have to work so hard, take it easy on your body now?	242_6.q	9.0	1	2nd Round	COUPE ROGERS	Masters 1000
3540_0	No.	3540_0.a	2011-02-23	F	3540	Francesca Schiavone	Shuai Peng	Is that one of the best wins of your career, do you think?	3540_0.q	38.0	1	2nd Round	QATAR LADIES OPEN	International
3540_1	No. You mean by ranking or...	3540_1.a	2011-02-23	F	3540	Francesca Schiavone	Shuai Peng	Fair enough. You're honest.	3540_1.q	38.0	1	2nd Round	QATAR LADIES OPEN	International
3540_2	Well, I feel it's not. Sorry for that.	3540_2.a	2011-02-23	F	3540	Francesca Schiavone	Shuai Peng	Just satisfaction, happiness.	3540_2.q	38.0	1	2nd Round	QATAR LADIES OPEN	International
3540_3	Well, I'm really happy to win today, but best win maybe was in San Diego when I played Kim Clijsters, because the time I think she was played hard court, she win like 30 or 33-or-something match in a row, you know. I was just win the time. I was just like really -- I think that would be what my remember like maybe biggest or happiest.	3540_3.a	2011-02-23	F	3540	Francesca Schiavone	Shuai Peng	What is your best victory in your career?	3540_3.q	38.0	1	2nd Round	QATAR LADIES OPEN	International
3540_4	Well, last year after Australian Open I get appendix, so then I have to go to the hospital, get a surgery. I have no choice. Then this took me a little bit time, and anyway, I come back and I play a lot. I think my body, because this I could not handle it, because the surgery I was like 10 days, I try to come back, play. And this hurt me and I was get injury. I have long time like French Open, Wimbledon, last year at all I didn't play. And then I come back. I was in the US Open from the long time. And then I hurt my arm, get turned in the muscle in doubles. So I don't want that, maybe like just sometime -- yeah, this I could not control, and I just, I was really happy this year. I come back. At least now I'm okay. Yeah, I was like go back before my coach, Alan, I was really happy, and then thanks for that, because last year I also have like my coach, you know, the coach left. So the time is really difficult for me. And then the time I also like would come back with me before the coach, Alan. He still really busy. He could not come with me this tournament. But still have coach come with me, because his team was working with Alan together. I think this really like help me for that, yeah.	3540_4.a	2011-02-23	F	3540	Francesca Schiavone	Shuai Peng	Can you explain why you were in qualify, you were injured and now you are in good shape? Can you explain exactly what happened these months?	3540_4.q	38.0	1	2nd Round	QATAR LADIES OPEN	International
3540_5	Well, I think I feel better, much better than last year than the Australian Open, because at that time, you know, I feel my body just not comfortable, but I didn't know why when I was going to hospital, checked it. You know, like is painful, but I sense my stomach, I didn't know, you know. So I think now I feel like my game maybe better than last year, than Australian Open that time, yeah.	3540_5.a	2011-02-23	F	3540	Francesca Schiavone	Shuai Peng	Do you think you have the same level as when you were in Australia last year now? Do you have the same level of tennis today compared with the Australian Open last year?	3540_5.q	38.0	1	2nd Round	QATAR LADIES OPEN	International
3540_6	Yeah. I think today I'm play good, and then because for her is here the first match and I was play already maybe like four match, right? Yeah, four match. I think for sure maybe about like the court. It's my first time play the center court, so, yeah, but I think compete with her maybe first match I was more maybe into the match, and then I think today I was play good, yeah.	3540_6.a	2011-02-23	F	3540	Francesca Schiavone	Shuai Peng	Francesca was saying, you know, today she just wasn't feeling right. Sometimes you come to a tennis tournament, and maybe your mind is not there, or you're physically exhausted or you're emotionally exhausted. Do you understand what she means? Sometimes as tennis players, you play so many tournaments, you're traveling all over the world. Do you understand what she's sort of going through?	3540_6.q	38.0	1	2nd Round	QATAR LADIES OPEN	International
3540_7	You mean in Doha?	3540_7.a	2011-02-23	F	3540	Francesca Schiavone	Shuai Peng	This is your first win in the main round here. Last time you lost after winning the first set in 2008. But it's a brilliant start for you in the main round? Good start in the main draw? Good match win in the main draw? I mean, because last time you had lost in the first round after winning the first set. But this year, this time getting...	3540_7.q	38.0	1	2nd Round	QATAR LADIES OPEN	International
3540_8	In Doha?	3540_8.a	2011-02-23	F	3540	Francesca Schiavone	Shuai Peng	Yeah, getting the first win in the main round with victory. Brilliant start? What do you think? After you won -- you had lost the first round in 2008.	3540_8.q	38.0	1	2nd Round	QATAR LADIES OPEN	International
3540_9	Yes, I think. Yes.	3540_9.a	2011-02-23	F	3540	Francesca Schiavone	Shuai Peng	In Doha. So first victory in the main round. It's a brilliant start to the tournament in the main round for you. Better start to the tournament this year? Better than 2008?	3540_9.q	38.0	1	2nd Round	QATAR LADIES OPEN	International
3540_10	I play her many times before, I think, and in the clay and the hard court. I think she's really good player. She like to hit the ball first. Then we both played (indiscernible). I was excited play tomorrow and then I try my best, and then fight in the court.	3540_10.a	2011-02-23	F	3540	Francesca Schiavone	Shuai Peng	How do you feel just to play Marion Bartoli tomorrow?	3540_10.q	38.0	1	2nd Round	QATAR LADIES OPEN	International
3540_11	(Laughter.) No. I go for dinner, and then get some treatment, shower, rest in the room. Yeah, maybe watch some DVD or like talk to online with my friend, parents, a little bit, and then sleep.	3540_11.a	2011-02-23	F	3540	Francesca Schiavone	Shuai Peng	You've got 20, 24 hours now before that game. What do you do? What are you going to do? Do you sit in your room and watch DVDs? Do you go do painting like Marion?	3540_11.q	38.0	1	2nd Round	QATAR LADIES OPEN	International
5925_0	No, that was good. That was really pleasing, and I always know that Sorana can be a tricky opponent. It was important for me not to let her back in the game, and I felt like I served well and I put the pressure on her and played the way I wanted to play today.	5925_0.a	2014-02-20	F	5925	Sorana Cirstea	Caroline Wozniacki	It doesn't get a lot better than that, does it?	5925_0.q	11.0	1	Quarterfinals	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS	Premier
5925_1	Well, last time we played on a really high level in Toronto, and I had two match points and I didn't win, which was quite disappointing for me. She went on to beat some great players and go to the finals. This time I decided what I needed to do out there and everything was going my way.	5925_1.a	2014-02-20	F	5925	Sorana Cirstea	Caroline Wozniacki	The way you played her today you lost to her two or three times. You have had tough matches against her. Why was it so different this time?	5925_1.q	11.0	1	Quarterfinals	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS	Premier
5925_2	I definitely think it's an advantage. I was here after the Australian Open and I was practicing here, and I was here all the way up to Doha basically and I was playing on these courts. So it definitely made me feel a little bit more comfortable, and I know all the secret spots on the court to hit it (laughter).	5925_2.a	2014-02-20	F	5925	Sorana Cirstea	Caroline Wozniacki	You spent a lot of time here obviously the past month or going back to the new year. How big of an advantage is it to know this is kind of like a home tournament and you have won here in the past?	5925_2.q	11.0	1	Quarterfinals	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS	Premier
5925_3	I love that the hotel and the courts are in one big complex. It makes it very easy for us players and not having the travel time. And I think Dubai, in general, it's such a great place. So many nice restaurants, so many fun things to do. I definitely think that has a lot to do with it.	5925_3.a	2014-02-20	F	5925	Sorana Cirstea	Caroline Wozniacki	What do you like about Dubai and this tournament?	5925_3.q	11.0	1	Quarterfinals	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS	Premier
5925_4	Venus is a great, great player. You know, you always know going out to play against her it's not going to be easy. She has won so much, and for me I just need to go out there and be focused on myself and my own game and give it all, and we will see what happens.	5925_4.a	2014-02-20	F	5925	Sorana Cirstea	Caroline Wozniacki	And your thoughts against Venus?	5925_4.q	11.0	1	Quarterfinals	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS	Premier
5925_5	I played her four times in a row pretty close to each other. I remember growing up in the juniors, my dad, I would say, Oh, this girl has a good serve. My dad is like, What? No, it's not Venus or Serena on the other side. Come on, no one has good serves on the junior tour. Then I made it to the WTA Tour and I was playing Venus for the first time, and I'm like, Okay, dad, this is before the match, give me the tactics, I'm actually playing Venus now, and so what am I supposed to do on that return? He goes, Oh, well, I don't know. Suit yourself out there (laughter). I remember that. We just had a good laugh about it. Yeah, I had some close matches with her back then, but a lot has changed and it's going to be a good match tomorrow.	5925_5.a	2014-02-20	F	5925	Sorana Cirstea	Caroline Wozniacki	I think the last time you played each other was 2008, so a lot has changed since then. How do you think you have improved since then?	5925_5.q	11.0	1	Quarterfinals	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS	Premier
5925_6	He's definitely not going to tell me that it's not Venus or Serena out there, that the serve isn't going to be very big. But I think I just need to play my own game, to play the way I want to play and make my move.	5925_6.a	2014-02-20	F	5925	Sorana Cirstea	Caroline Wozniacki	Is he going to give you extra advice for tomorrow?	5925_6.q	11.0	1	Quarterfinals	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS	Premier
5925_7	Yeah, of course, and I remember, I think it was Venus that was playing, and then she had these things in her hair.	5925_7.a	2014-02-20	F	5925	Sorana Cirstea	Caroline Wozniacki	Can you remember watching them at home when you were a kid?	5925_7.q	11.0	1	Quarterfinals	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS	Premier
5925_8	Yeah, at the US Open. I remember that. And then obviously I remember when they were not starting but when they had made their mark on the tour and started to give like Hingis big trouble because they had so much power and players couldn't keep up, and, yeah, I think they definitely changed the game.	5925_8.a	2014-02-20	F	5925	Sorana Cirstea	Caroline Wozniacki	The beads?	5925_8.q	11.0	1	Quarterfinals	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS	Premier
5925_9	Well, obviously they I think they are great role models. They do a lot of charity work. I think they are great for the game, because they, you know, they stand up for the players. They are in the council. They do a lot for the WTA Tour. So not only just as to power in the game, not only how much they have won, but also how they represent the tour, I think, is great.	5925_9.a	2014-02-20	F	5925	Sorana Cirstea	Caroline Wozniacki	Just in terms of power or in any other things?	5925_9.q	11.0	1	Quarterfinals	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS	Premier
5925_10	Well, they are some of my good friends. I would say they are part of the crowd unless I'm not part of the crowd (smiling).	5925_10.a	2014-02-20	F	5925	Sorana Cirstea	Caroline Wozniacki	Are they part of the crowd, or are they a little bit separate?	5925_10.q	11.0	1	Quarterfinals	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS	Premier
5925_11	Honestly, I just want to play tomorrow and do well, and then I don't really think about the finals yet. So I will have a tough one tomorrow to get through.	5925_11.a	2014-02-20	F	5925	Sorana Cirstea	Caroline Wozniacki	To win the tournament, you might have to go through Venus and then Serena. Does that excite you, that sort of challenge, being put up against two modernday greats like that?	5925_11.q	11.0	1	Quarterfinals	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS	Premier
5925_12	I don't think that I'm the one that should answer that. I always believe when I go out that I can win, and right now I'm here and that's all I care about. I'm two matches away from winning the tournament, so that's how far I am.	5925_12.a	2014-02-20	F	5925	Sorana Cirstea	Caroline Wozniacki	How close would you say you are to winning a Grand Slam in the scheme of things? I know you dropped out in the third round in Australia. Do you think that wasn't a fair reflection of where your game is at the moment?	5925_12.q	11.0	1	Quarterfinals	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS	Premier
442_0	I think it was a good match overall, especially after not playing for a month. So I didn't know really what to expect. I've been feeling really good during practice, but when you step out on the court for official match, it could be tricky. But I think I handled myself really well. You know, the second set was a little bit tighter, but I stepped up when I needed to and really raised my level. So I'm glad I've been able to do that.	442_0.a	2015-08-11	F	442	Elina Svitolina	Victoria Azarenka	How did you feel you played in your match?	442_0.q	21.0	1	1st Round	ROGERS CUP	Premier
442_1	Well, definitely more challenging, because the first round, second rounds. But that's something that I don't try to look as a disadvantage. Looking from where I'm coming from almost not playing a year of course the ranking will drop. So I have to slowly and steady be coming my way up and I've been playing really good. I just lost a few times to a No.1 player, and I think a Top 10 player. So the level is there. It's just a matter of really going and getting the rankings up, and that's it. But I'm not too worried about that. The important thing is for me to keep improving my game and getting those wins, even if it's second round or third round against a top player. So that's the most important for me.	442_1.a	2015-08-11	F	442	Elina Svitolina	Victoria Azarenka	Has this year been more tiring for you just given that you have higher seeds, because you have to play a lot more in the tournaments and you have tougher matches earlier on? Has the year been more tiring than previous years when you had a higher seed?	442_1.q	21.0	1	1st Round	ROGERS CUP	Premier
442_2	I think it depends on really how you feel. I think sometimes it can be more difficult mentally just because you don't have that much confidence in yourself. And sometimes it can be physical if you had done some adjustments in your game or in your physical condition. So for me probably the most challenging is to getting after gym, you know, going and getting that I would say less clumsiness on the court. Sometimes I get a little clumsy, but rather than that mentally I've been preparing myself in practice like I was playing a match. So it was pretty easy transition mentally today. But physically definitely, you know, you can't reproduce the nerves and the emotions that you have during the match, so it's always going to be that unknown part. But physically, I think it's for me been a little bit challenging just because of the work I've done off court.	442_2.a	2015-08-11	F	442	Elina Svitolina	Victoria Azarenka	What's the weirdest thing like when you spend a specific training block, just training and practicing and then stepping on to the match court you were saying it can be a little bit, it takes some time to get the rhythm, but is it physical, is it mental, is it tactical? What is the biggest difference between your practice court game and what happens in the match?	442_2.q	21.0	1	1st Round	ROGERS CUP	Premier
442_3	I don't really think about them, to be honest, because I don't look back too much. And it's something that feels like it's been forever ago. So I feel like today, you know, in my game, myself personally grew so much that it's difficult to go back and think about those memories or those feelings that were on the court back then. But I'm looking forward to make another one.	442_3.a	2015-08-11	F	442	Elina Svitolina	Victoria Azarenka	When you've been healthy you've been one of the players who's been able to challenge Serena the most consistently. What do you recall most about those two US Open Finals you played against her?	442_3.q	21.0	1	1st Round	ROGERS CUP	Premier
442_4	Excitement, really, because this is the most challenging probably place to play is the US Open finals against Serena, you know. So for me it's really exciting that something that gets me going every time.	442_4.a	2015-08-11	F	442	Elina Svitolina	Victoria Azarenka	Is there something that comes back to you just when you think about the occasion of playing her on that stage?	442_4.q	21.0	1	1st Round	ROGERS CUP	Premier
442_5	Well, I think the difference between 2012 and 2015, first of all, I feel like I'm playing a lot better. I grew as a player. I have a lot more variety, a lot more power, a lot more consistency and better game overall. So for me, I don't look in getting back there, because that was something that I wanted to build from, and I think so far I've been doing a good job improving myself. And at one point it's all going to connect, and I feel it's getting so much better. And I'm just excited for the future.	442_5.a	2015-08-11	F	442	Elina Svitolina	Victoria Azarenka	When you're out there, your game, does it feel like it's getting back to that level where you were at? I know you just said you don't look back, but when you're playing does it feel like you're at that level when you were playing in 2012 and 2013?	442_5.q	21.0	1	1st Round	ROGERS CUP	Premier
442_6	Not too much really, but it's actually very exciting for me because we haven't played in such a long time. So when people ask me what do you expect, I don't really remember. So I'll have to just I think it's going to be quite a few quite a few feeling tomorrow.	442_6.a	2015-08-11	F	442	Elina Svitolina	Victoria Azarenka	Have you thought about your next match at all?	442_6.q	21.0	1	1st Round	ROGERS CUP	Premier
442_7	Well, there is no drastic thing to change, because I feel at this level there is no I'm not a junior. I'm not developing my game. I'm just improving details. For me it's just going after it and working really hard and giving myself the best opportunity to take out of every day, you know, the best quality. I think at this level it's more about quality than quantity and really trying to work on specific things. But when we sat down, we just I felt that my game was raising up, so I don't feel like there is much to change. But there is a lot to improve.	442_7.a	2015-08-11	F	442	Elina Svitolina	Victoria Azarenka	After as well as you played on the clay and then into the grass, when you kind of sat down with Sascha and with Winn afterwards and hit into this training block, was it like, okay, let's just keep doing what we've been doing and making the gradual progression forward or were there certain more drastic changes or anything that maybe you thought let's definitely key in on this before we head into the hard court stretch?	442_7.q	21.0	1	1st Round	ROGERS CUP	Premier
442_8	Freshness and what?	442_8.a	2015-08-11	F	442	Elina Svitolina	Victoria Azarenka	When you came back on tour having been kind of injured for a while, was there like a sense of freshness and newness to the tour again which maybe had gone away when you were playing in Europe?	442_8.q	21.0	1	1st Round	ROGERS CUP	Premier
442_9	Young again? Well, (laughs). I don't know. I just turned 26, and I can't believe that, actually. Everybody say, hey, you are still a baby, and to me it feels like it's been forever I've been playing on tour. But definitely a different approach mentally that I have since I came back, and I don't think it has anything to do really with tennis game or tennis surroundings. It's what I have done personally off court for myself. So that really just gives me a kind of a new out look, a new fresh start, and that will transform into a tennis court because that's what my life is about right now.	442_9.a	2015-08-11	F	442	Elina Svitolina	Victoria Azarenka	Just sort of freshness, newness like you were starting again, like you were young again almost?	442_9.q	21.0	1	1st Round	ROGERS CUP	Premier
442_10	Just getting, you know, myself on track, you know, taking responsibilities for your actions, learning from your mistakes, getting organized, which I hate, and now I'm really good at it. You know, having probably the best relationship with my parents that I ever had. So that was something that I worked really hard on, and it's amazing to me.	442_10.a	2015-08-11	F	442	Elina Svitolina	Victoria Azarenka	What are some of those things off the court?	442_10.q	21.0	1	1st Round	ROGERS CUP	Premier
442_11	Oh, everything, because I'm like a perfectionist and that's why I need to like sometimes give myself a little bit of a, I don't know, pat on the back and say good job, you know, because I don't like to be too satisfied because then I get myself too comfortable and then I'm not motivated. But I feel that I still have a lot of potential to improve as much on the court as much off the court in the physical, and I feel like I improved a lot with you guys since wherever I started. So that's definitely a good job. (Laughs).	442_11.a	2015-08-11	F	442	Elina Svitolina	Victoria Azarenka	And what are some of the areas you still kind of looking to get better, either on court or off court?	442_11.q	21.0	1	1st Round	ROGERS CUP	Premier
4458_0	Well, I mean, of course there's always going to be disappointment when you lose, you know, quarter of the US Open, but I have to say I'm really pleased with the way I played. I thought it was a really, really good match, and there was, what, a point or two in it. You know, I'm really happy with the way I played out there, and I gave it everything I had.	4458_0.a	2012-09-04	F	4458	Victoria Azarenka	Samantha Stosur	You put up a great fight out there today. Came up short in the end. How do you feel about the match?	4458_0.q	7.0	0	Quarterfinals	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4458_1	Yeah, it's probably up there with it. It's been a rough year. I mean, I came off a pretty rough spot before coming to the U.S. hard court season. I have really been able to turn my form around really quickly and come here to NewYork and play great all of my matches. I guess that's definitely a pleasing aspect of what's happened out there the last couple of weeks.	4458_1.a	2012-09-04	F	4458	Victoria Azarenka	Samantha Stosur	Was that some of your best tennis of the year, you think?	4458_1.q	7.0	0	Quarterfinals	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4458_2	Yeah, I love playing out there. It is a great court to play on. The atmosphere and the crowd and I guess everything that makes it what it is is just, you know, fantastic to play out there. It's a dream to play on the center courts of Grand Slams. To have so many opportunities to do that, especially here, it's been, yeah, fantastic.	4458_2.a	2012-09-04	F	4458	Victoria Azarenka	Samantha Stosur	What's your relationship with that stadium out there? Are you building a love a affair for it?	4458_2.q	7.0	0	Quarterfinals	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4458_3	Oh, yeah, well, I mean, she never gives up. She fights very hard every single match she plays and she does it very well. That's probably part of the reason she's No.1 at the moment. She's one of the players you have to get out there and she barely gives you any points and you have to work hard for every single point you get.	4458_3.a	2012-09-04	F	4458	Victoria Azarenka	Samantha Stosur	What are your impressions of the fight and determination of Victoria?	4458_3.q	7.0	0	Quarterfinals	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4458_4	Well, I mean, I had a pretty good idea of what I wanted to do out there today. The first set didn't really come off at all. The rain delay at 3Love, I kind of came off and thought, Okay, well 3Love is not the greatest start, but I really thought I should stick to what I was trying to do. As the match went on and kind of got into it a little bit more, then I started to see it was paying dividends. Just kept trying to plug away and started playing really well and really took my opportunities when I had them. And like I said, you've got to work hard for every point you get out there, so you've really got to be on yourself every single point to not give away a loose error, because you're not going to get one back.	4458_4.a	2012-09-04	F	4458	Victoria Azarenka	Samantha Stosur	How did you actually fall into working into the match?	4458_4.q	7.0	0	Quarterfinals	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4458_5	Well, I never thought that I was going to lose, but you certainly don't want to get ahead of yourself and think, Oh, I have just broken back again; I'm going to win. Tennis can change very quickly, but I was trying to play each point for what it was. I think in a match like that you can't afford to get ahead of yourself and lose focus for a second. So, yeah, it was one of those matches where you just kind of kept playing, and, bang, all of a sudden you've lost a tiebreak but you didn't know what was gonna happen.	4458_5.a	2012-09-04	F	4458	Victoria Azarenka	Samantha Stosur	Did you think perhaps you had her? She lost the challenge and then went on to break her. I think it was 44 at that point. Did you think, Maybe I have this after all?	4458_5.q	7.0	0	Quarterfinals	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4458_6	Well, I mean, I don't know. I guess we'll find out in the next few days. No, I have to say I think she's the favorite to go on and win. I think she's been playing incredible the last few months. If anybody's going to beat her they have to play very well, be aggressive, hit winners, not give her anything, and try and temper her serve. Serena, when she's on, is pretty tough to beat.	4458_6.a	2012-09-04	F	4458	Victoria Azarenka	Samantha Stosur	You did something here in the final last year that not too many people have been able to do lately: beat Serena Williams. She's on a good roll. What are your impressions of the possibility somebody can beat Serena Williams here this year?	4458_6.q	7.0	0	Quarterfinals	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4458_7	I don't know. It's hard to say, but I think I played very well today. I mean, I don't know whether it was better or the same or what. But I guess going into a match like that where you've never beaten a player before, you've got to just play well and really get everything out of yourself that you can. That's what I did today and just came up short. You know, it's disappointing, but at least I know that I came, you know, within a whisker of getting there today.	4458_7.a	2012-09-04	F	4458	Victoria Azarenka	Samantha Stosur	Your play in the last two sets, is that the equal of the way you played against Serena last year?	4458_7.q	7.0	0	Quarterfinals	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4458_8	Yeah, I think about half the line and break point, so wasn't too happy with that one.	4458_8.a	2012-09-04	F	4458	Victoria Azarenka	Samantha Stosur	Do you remember her only ace of the match?	4458_8.q	7.0	0	Quarterfinals	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4458_9	Oh, for sure. I mean, she's a tough player, but, you know, I think I'm capable of beating her one day. Just would have liked it to have been today. I will certainly take a lot of confidence out of this match and out of the whole week.	4458_9.a	2012-09-04	F	4458	Victoria Azarenka	Samantha Stosur	Does the result give you confidence that you eventually will get a win over Victoria?	4458_9.q	7.0	0	Quarterfinals	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4458_10	Absolutely. I think going into this tournament I was struggling a little bit but gaining that momentum and confidence. To really turn it around, you know, in one of the biggest tournaments of the year, that's what we come out here and play for. I think that proves to me that I am capable of doing it. To have another showing here at the Open like this, it for sure gives me confidence to think that maybe one day I can do it again.	4458_10.a	2012-09-04	F	4458	Victoria Azarenka	Samantha Stosur	Effectively does it further reinforce in your mind that you can be a contender again in the next couple of years?	4458_10.q	7.0	0	Quarterfinals	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4458_11	No, I mean, I knew we were playing a good match. It was exciting and there was, you know, momentum here, momentum there. We were hitting winners and running all over the court. So I knew that was going on. Again, you can feel that, but you don't sit down at change of ends and say, Oh, gee, this is fun or anything. They are the matches you like to play. They're the most enjoyable, but not necessarily at the moment you've got that going through your head.	4458_11.a	2012-09-04	F	4458	Victoria Azarenka	Samantha Stosur	The standard and level of play was just so high in the match. Do you allow yourself to get involved in that situation, or are you just so focused that you can't think of anything else?	4458_11.q	7.0	0	Quarterfinals	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4458_12	Yeah, I mean, I heard them on the change of ends. When I hit that smash winner to go 5All in the tiebreak they really erupted. I felt that. Yeah, it was again a great atmosphere. Really got a crowd that big and so into a match like that, it's always, like I said, enjoyable to play. It really keeps you going and you want to be out there as long as you can.	4458_12.a	2012-09-04	F	4458	Victoria Azarenka	Samantha Stosur	Did you hear the crowd? Were you able to hear the Aussie, Aussie, Aussie chants?	4458_12.q	7.0	0	Quarterfinals	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4458_13	I don't know where they come from, but the last few years I have managed to pull quite a few off. It's not a shot I necessarily practice too much. I guess I've got the timing on it and I think my opponents don't know what to do with it when it comes just lasering over the net.	4458_13.a	2012-09-04	F	4458	Victoria Azarenka	Samantha Stosur	Those squash shots really took the crowd's breath away, too. They were pretty impressive today.	4458_13.q	7.0	0	Quarterfinals	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4458_14	I don't know. I think even earlier on my career, years before, I had matches against her that I had beaten her. There was one in Sydney I had four match points and lost. For whatever reason I have always kind of enjoyed that challenge of playing her. I know that if I don't play well, I'm more than likely not gonna win. It's just a matter of going out there and trying to play as best as you can and enjoying that challenge. You know, you're out there playing maybe one of the greatest players ever. So what can you do but try and play well and enjoy the moment and do your best?	4458_14.a	2012-09-04	F	4458	Victoria Azarenka	Samantha Stosur	Serena obviously has an aura being Serena, but also coming off what she's done at Wimbledon and the Olympics. You obviously have cracked that aura last year. Is it tough to mentally get to a place, is she just another player, or mentally is it sort of a walk you have to go through to realize you can take her down?	4458_14.q	7.0	0	Quarterfinals	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4458_15	Oh, I think she's going to be very tough to meet. Victoria played really well today so you can't discount anyone. I think going on form before this event and so far, it's very hard to go past her, I think.	4458_15.a	2012-09-04	F	4458	Victoria Azarenka	Samantha Stosur	Is she the pick here to go on and win now?	4458_15.q	7.0	0	Quarterfinals	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4458_16	Yeah, I think, like I just said, if she's not the greatest, she's definitely right up there with the first few. So to achieve what she's achieved, won all the Grand Slams in singles and doubles and gold medals and all that, you know, you read through, you know, some of her stats, and it's quite remarkable. To have the career she's had over such a long time, it is, yeah, remarkable. You've got to take your hat off to it. And keep coming back year after year after year and be able to perform the way she does, yeah, I think she's definitely right up there.	4458_16.a	2012-09-04	F	4458	Victoria Azarenka	Samantha Stosur	Kim said earlier in the tournament that she thought that Serena was the greatest player ever. What are your thoughts on Serena's place in history when she's playing as well as she is now and with the future ahead of her?	4458_16.q	7.0	0	Quarterfinals	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4458_17	I will go back to where I live in Florida for a couple of days and pack up stuff and go back to Australia, five or six days, head up to Tokyo, and then do the whole Asian swing.	4458_17.a	2012-09-04	F	4458	Victoria Azarenka	Samantha Stosur	What's the plan for you now, immediately next week or two?	4458_17.q	7.0	0	Quarterfinals	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4458_18	I mean, her first serve I think is one of the best in the world. It comes from a pretty hard trajectory and she's got very good technique on that serve. The ball bounces up and she can hit her spots. Sometimes you just gotta kinda guess every now and then and try and read what's going on, because, I mean, she can hit it really hard, but she can obviously take the pace off and slide it wide. You never quite know what necessarily is coming straight at you. I think she's one of those players that really can mix it up well and it's hard to sometimes get a read, but, you know, sometimes I have been able to do that.	4458_18.a	2012-09-04	F	4458	Victoria Azarenka	Samantha Stosur	Regarding Serena, what about her serve makes it so difficult?	4458_18.q	7.0	0	Quarterfinals	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4458_19	I remember the last one. To be honest, I can't remember exactly what happened at 5All, but she hit a dropshot. Yeah, I hit a good serve, and once again she hit a good return back deep. I think I hit another shot and tried to get around, hit a forehand, and then she got maybe a bit lucky and it actually went over. Again, just constantly under pressure. At 5All I don't think I did much wrong. And then match point she, again, hit a ball pretty much on the line, and, you know, you're just under that pressure the whole time. But stuck to my guns and handled it really well. 5All, you lose two points, you're done after twoandahalf hours.	4458_19.a	2012-09-04	F	4458	Victoria Azarenka	Samantha Stosur	This match came down to 55 in the tiebreaker. I missed the top of this, so pardon me if you alluded to this already. Can you take us from 55 in the tiebreaker to the last two points?	4458_19.q	7.0	0	Quarterfinals	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1007_0	You could look at it either way.  Unfortunately for Tomas, that's not the way you want to go out.  But there's not much I can do about it.	1007_0.a	2007-09-03	M	1007	Tomas Berdych	Andy Roddick	Is that good or bad, meaning good to win but not much activity?	1007_0.q	5.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1007_1	Pretty early.  Pretty early in the match.	1007_1.a	2007-09-03	M	1007	Tomas Berdych	Andy Roddick	How early did you spot there was something wrong?	1007_1.q	5.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1007_2	I heard him say something to the umpire, I think, early on in the first.  Then, of course, I'm trying to eavesdrop on his whole conversation he's having with the trainer, as well, while they're out there, if he's pointing to a leg.	1007_2.a	2007-09-03	M	1007	Tomas Berdych	Andy Roddick	Was it because he asked for the trainer after the third game?	1007_2.q	5.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1007_3	Yeah, that's what I heard.  That makes tennis difficult.	1007_3.a	2007-09-03	M	1007	Tomas Berdych	Andy Roddick	He said he couldn't breathe.	1007_3.q	5.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1007_4	Yeah, I went straight out to the practice court from that court.	1007_4.a	2007-09-03	M	1007	Tomas Berdych	Andy Roddick	Do you mind telling us if you went from there to hit some or if you plan to hit any more today?	1007_4.q	5.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1007_5	45 minutes, an hour, something like that.	1007_5.a	2007-09-03	M	1007	Tomas Berdych	Andy Roddick	How long did you spend?  Are you feeling you got in a good day?	1007_5.q	5.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1007_6	I don't know.  I don't know if it does too much good to worry about it because it's out of my hands.  I know that this is a lot better than being dead tired.  Given the two options, I'll take this one.	1007_6.a	2007-09-03	M	1007	Tomas Berdych	Andy Roddick	Is it a positive or a negative to be so fresh?  You want to be fresh, but do you want to be this fresh?	1007_6.q	5.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1007_7	Nothing.  I just asked him what was wrong.  He said, you know -- said he was just tired and couldn't really do much.  I just told him I hope he got better.	1007_7.a	2007-09-03	M	1007	Tomas Berdych	Andy Roddick	What did he say to you at the net?	1007_7.q	5.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1007_8	I haven't been tested much this tournament so far.  I was on the ropes a little bit against Gimel.  Acasuso played a good first set.  I haven't really played a long, extended match.	1007_8.a	2007-09-03	M	1007	Tomas Berdych	Andy Roddick	Do you feel like you've been tested?  At what points during this tournament do you feel you've been tested?  By Johansson?	1007_8.q	5.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1007_9	I'm not sure.  I mean, I think we played each other enough, you kind of know.  I don't think I'm going to watch him and discover that he's good tonight, you know. But, yeah, I don't know.  I'm not sure.	1007_9.a	2007-09-03	M	1007	Tomas Berdych	Andy Roddick	Will you watch Federer's match tonight?  If so, at this point, do you ever learn anything from watching him on TV?	1007_9.q	5.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1007_10	No offense to Lpez, but I'm kind of already preparing for Roger.	1007_10.a	2007-09-03	M	1007	Tomas Berdych	Andy Roddick	Will you be rooting one way or another?	1007_10.q	5.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1007_11	I just feel like everybody is so fairweather.  I feel like it's a process.  I don't think it can be judged on a tournament-to-tournament basis.  They're winning tournaments.  James and I are at the same rankings we have been for the last little while.  There's a little bit of youth in this tournament as far as the men's side. You know, I don't see how it's too much different than it has been.  But, you know, there's a good buzz around it, which is a nice change.	1007_11.a	2007-09-03	M	1007	Tomas Berdych	Andy Roddick	Last night Venus was saying either she or her sister could get to the finals.  You were playing well, James Blake.  She said all of a sudden American tennis is looking pretty good.  Could you make a comment on that?	1007_11.q	5.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1007_12	I'd like to.  That's the goal.	1007_12.a	2007-09-03	M	1007	Tomas Berdych	Andy Roddick	Does getting to a quarterfinal mean anything for you?  James hasn't been past, but you have.  Do you have to make a couple more steps for it to be a successful tournament?	1007_12.q	5.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1007_13	An emotional rhythm?  You sound like my therapist.	1007_13.a	2007-09-03	M	1007	Tomas Berdych	Andy Roddick	You spoke to the physical aspect of not being dead tired, better than the alternative.  A Slam usually builds emotionally as well with each round.  You haven't gotten into an emotional rhythm.	1007_13.q	5.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1007_14	Congrats.	1007_14.a	2007-09-03	M	1007	Tomas Berdych	Andy Roddick	That was my other career goal.	1007_14.q	5.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1007_15	I don't know.  Like I said, you could probably spin it either way you wanted to.  You could say I could be fresh mentally or maybe I haven't been freaking out enough over the past two weeks.  I don't know. You guys can run with that any way you want.  It's kind of out of my hands.  I'm going to kind of focus on the task at hand.	1007_15.a	2007-09-03	M	1007	Tomas Berdych	Andy Roddick	Can you speak to that?  You said you haven't been tested.  Now you're going to face the ultimate test maybe.  Is that a problem, that you haven't had that mental time to prepare?	1007_15.q	5.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1007_16	No, I think strategy matters.  You know, but you have to have your strategy and then you have to be able to execute it.	1007_16.a	2007-09-03	M	1007	Tomas Berdych	Andy Roddick	Does strategy matter against Roger or do you pretty much have to be perfect or almost perfect?	1007_16.q	5.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1007_17	I don't know.  I've never played him in the quarters.	1007_17.a	2007-09-03	M	1007	Tomas Berdych	Andy Roddick	Is there a difference playing him in the quarters and playing him in the final?  Is there any benefit at all to get him in the quarters?	1007_17.q	5.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1007_18	Probably.  Probably.  I don't know exactly.  I might be commenting out of complete ignorance here because I'm not actually sure what Tomas' problem was.  Indy I felt horrible.  You feel like you're kind of going through the motions. That's kind of what it looked like with him, especially early on in the second set after he kind of lost maybe his even the emotional hope after the first set. I don't know a tennis player who hasn't been there before when your body's just not reacting.  I can definitely sympathize with that.	1007_18.a	2007-09-03	M	1007	Tomas Berdych	Andy Roddick	Anything comparable for him today to the way you felt in the semifinals in Indianapolis?	1007_18.q	5.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1007_19	It's tough because you're trying to play a certain way, and then he's taking the first ball and just crushing it.  Either way, it kind of takes strategy out of it.  You're just trying to fight off balls. He hits the ball big enough where you can still be relevant doing that.  It was a little bit of a tricky situation.	1007_19.a	2007-09-03	M	1007	Tomas Berdych	Andy Roddick	Did you still worry about him?	1007_19.q	5.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1007_20	I think you feel the extra weight of most big matches.  That's just the way it is.  But I'm excited.  I expect a lot of myself.  I don't think anybody else really expects much from me (laughter). I'm excited.  To play him, I'm assuming it will be a night session, you know, the crowd will be electric, and I'll be excited.  I'm excited about the opportunity.	1007_20.a	2007-09-03	M	1007	Tomas Berdych	Andy Roddick	You go into every match with the same preparation, but going into this next match if you play Roger, can you feel the extra weight?	1007_20.q	5.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1007_21	Yeah, I was playing well.  Pretty even up till 4-All.  He got on a hot streak, was able to kind of reel off some breaks.  Once Roger gets momentum, it's tough to play catch-up.  Just got away from me.	1007_21.a	2007-09-03	M	1007	Tomas Berdych	Andy Roddick	Eight months have passed now.  Can you reflect back on Australia and just talk about what you think happened in that match.  Going in there you were playing outstanding.	1007_21.q	5.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1007_22	There's a big sense of relief to get through that first set because I could tell he was laboring a little bit.  The difference between winning the first set and losing the first set as far as his mentality is huge. But as far as him throwing it in when he did, I felt like I was in control either way.	1007_22.a	2007-09-03	M	1007	Tomas Berdych	Andy Roddick	Considering how well you played in the first set, was there any sense of relief he retired?	1007_22.q	5.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1007_23	I'm saying people are going to call him the favorite.  Maybe I misspoke, you know.  Trust me, I know you guys expect a lot from me (smiling).	1007_23.a	2007-09-03	M	1007	Tomas Berdych	Andy Roddick	You say you don't think people expect anything of you in this match.  What do you mean?	1007_23.q	5.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1007_24	The Australian Open is in the past.  It's in the past.  I mean, it's eight months ago.  If you want me to sit here and go through it.  You guys can go through it.  It only took about 45 minutes.  You guys got that much time.  You can go back and look at it if you need some retrospect.	1007_24.a	2007-09-03	M	1007	Tomas Berdych	Andy Roddick	When he gets open a roll like that, now that the Australian Open is over, have you thought what you can do when he starts playing like that?	1007_24.q	5.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1007_25	Okay.	1007_25.a	2007-09-03	M	1007	Tomas Berdych	Andy Roddick	Your net game has become an important part of your game.  Against Roger it seems like sometimes he's drawing you in when he wants you to come in rather than you coming in on your own terms.	1007_25.q	5.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1007_26	What do you want me to talk about?  I agree with what you said.	1007_26.a	2007-09-03	M	1007	Tomas Berdych	Andy Roddick	Can you talk about that, because obviously it's not like you're going to play him completely from the baseline.	1007_26.q	5.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1007_27	I think a big thing against Roger's making sure you get something on your approach shot.  If he's set, he's going to take a swing at it and he's going to hit it more often than not.  Even if he is bringing you in you got to make sure you get some stick on your approaches.  I think that's an important factor.	1007_27.a	2007-09-03	M	1007	Tomas Berdych	Andy Roddick	Just talk about your approach to that.	1007_27.q	5.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1007_28	Yeah.  I think the more you do something, the better you get at it.  I'm a lot better at it than I was a couple years ago.  So maybe.	1007_28.a	2007-09-03	M	1007	Tomas Berdych	Andy Roddick	Is coming in to the net getting more instinctive for you?	1007_28.q	5.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1007_29	I watched a little bit of it.	1007_29.a	2007-09-03	M	1007	Tomas Berdych	Andy Roddick	Did you watch Isner's match against Federer?	1007_29.q	5.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1007_30	I think I missed the good part of it (smiling).  I was in here talking to you all.	1007_30.a	2007-09-03	M	1007	Tomas Berdych	Andy Roddick	Did you have any impressions?	1007_30.q	5.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1007_31	Well, I saw it up till about 5-All.  I came in here.  I saw it was 0-0 in the second.  I didn't see the exciting part.	1007_31.a	2007-09-03	M	1007	Tomas Berdych	Andy Roddick	Didn't see the first set?	1007_31.q	5.0	1	4th Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1117_0	Some points.  Just have big chances in the fifth, 15-40.  Especially, well, I wasn't feel I play worse than him from the baseline, no?  Maybe if we have to find any difference, maybe the difference is the serve.  He serve better than me, and that's important in every surface, but in this surface more, no?	1117_0.a	2007-07-08	M	1117	Roger Federer	Rafael Nadal	What would you say made the difference in this match?	1117_0.q	2.0	0	The Final	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1117_1	Well, I play great tournament, no?  I play very good level, playing against one of the best of the history in this surface, having two chances for a win I'm playing at a similar level. I can say nothing bad about my tournament.  Well, today was a little bit disappointing because I have good chances.  But happy, tomorrow I will be happy about my tournament and about my game.	1117_1.a	2007-07-08	M	1117	Roger Federer	Rafael Nadal	Federer says yesterday in the conference you are in the driver's seat when it comes to clay, and not on grass.	1117_1.q	2.0	0	The Final	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1117_2	Yeah, was tough for me, no, because I have two 15-40s in the fifth.  One was big chance for have the break.  I wasn't lose the serve till the second game of the match.  I know if I have the break in the fifth I have very good chances for have the title, no? Well, he save some points with the serve.  And later when he has to win, he has to break me, he play very good.  So, well, just congratulate him.  Good win for him.	1117_2.a	2007-07-08	M	1117	Roger Federer	Rafael Nadal	Being broken for 4-2 seemed to maybe just push your game down a bit.  What were you feeling at that time?	1117_2.q	2.0	0	The Final	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1117_3	Well, was not the best moment, no, because I was playing fine in the fourth for a while and I have to call to the trainer.  But doesn't matter, no?  Just right now is better, so doesn't matter.  Don't worry about the knee.  Thank you, but was fine.	1117_3.a	2007-07-08	M	1117	Roger Federer	Rafael Nadal	What about the knee, and the injury?	1117_3.q	2.0	0	The Final	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1117_4	On my breakpoints?  No, sure not.  I remember all the breakpoints if you want.	1117_4.a	2007-07-08	M	1117	Roger Federer	Rafael Nadal	On one of the breakpoints in the fifth set, you had a backhand volley to the open court but you didn't hit it that hard.  Was that the key shot?	1117_4.q	2.0	0	The Final	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1117_5	My best opportunity was in the 30-40 of the first breakpoint, the first game when I have the breakpoint.  I have good return. He come back.  I touch very good close backhand, and, well, he return very good the ball and I miss the forehand for go to the other side, the winner forehand.  That's best chance.	1117_5.a	2007-07-08	M	1117	Roger Federer	Rafael Nadal	What was your best opportunity?	1117_5.q	2.0	0	The Final	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1117_6	Well, the best player of the history have 14.  He has 11.  So he's very close.  He's still playing unbelievable. Anyway, if he going to win 14 or 16 or 13, my opinion, the tennis level is the best of the history.	1117_6.a	2007-07-08	M	1117	Roger Federer	Rafael Nadal	Federer has won so many Grand Slams now that some people are saying he could become the greatest player of all time.  How much would you agree with that?	1117_6.q	2.0	0	The Final	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1117_7	I said yesterday and this season, no, I am playing better.  I am playing better than last year.  I am better player than last year, sure. Maybe, well, compared with Roger right now is not possible yet because he has 11 Grand Slams, me three.  But, well, I am young.  I am improving every season and try continuing improving every day, practice with illusion. Well, today was tough for me, but at the same time, well, is good watch me playing one final like this against the best of the world on grass, playing at similar level. So, yeah, happy about my game and happy about my season right now.  I have to continue.	1117_7.a	2007-07-08	M	1117	Roger Federer	Rafael Nadal	Do you feel now that your rivalry with Roger has moved beyond questions of about preferred surface, and now there's only a few points separating you on any surface anywhere in the world?	1117_7.q	2.0	0	The Final	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1117_8	On the match?	1117_8.a	2007-07-08	M	1117	Roger Federer	Rafael Nadal	Today you looked very angry.  Were you angry or just intense concentration?	1117_8.q	2.0	0	The Final	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1117_9	You watch me smile in the last matches when I am on court?  And you watched me the other matches of the week?	1117_9.a	2007-07-08	M	1117	Roger Federer	Rafael Nadal	Yeah.  No smile, no light, nothing.	1117_9.q	2.0	0	The Final	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1117_10	The same?  So is nothing different.  Just concentrate.	1117_10.a	2007-07-08	M	1117	Roger Federer	Rafael Nadal	Yes.  Is the same.	1117_10.q	2.0	0	The Final	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1117_11	I tried to play as aggressive as possible.  That's my strategy.  Just try to play good. I was touching very good the ball yesterday in the practicing, afternoon, today morning.  During the match I was playing fine, touching very good the ball.  Just try to play hard with the forehand and with all shots.	1117_11.a	2007-07-08	M	1117	Roger Federer	Rafael Nadal	You seemed to be playing a lot closer to the baseline in this match.  Was that conscious?  Was this a change of strategy to try to get to the net faster?	1117_11.q	2.0	0	The Final	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1117_12	Clay right now.	1117_12.a	2007-07-08	M	1117	Roger Federer	Rafael Nadal	You must be very tired as well.  What is your preparation now for the hard court season?	1117_12.q	2.0	0	The Final	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1117_13	I come back to Stuttgart right now next week.  Important tournament.  I have now the best preparation is have some days off, recover the power. After Stuttgart I going to have some more days off, one week and a half for prepare Montral, Cincinnati and US Open.	1117_13.a	2007-07-08	M	1117	Roger Federer	Rafael Nadal	You have America coming up.	1117_13.q	2.0	0	The Final	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
1117_14	Nothing special, no?  I have good chances for winning very important tournament for me.  And normal.  I lose one hour before.  I am a good loser.  I accept the loss very well.  And, well, the lose don't affect me more than some hours.  After that I forgot and I am hundred percent fine. But, well, first moment, especially losing in fifth set, it's not easy, no?	1117_14.a	2007-07-08	M	1117	Roger Federer	Rafael Nadal	Right after the handshake at the net, the way you were sitting in your chair, you seemed very, very disappointed.  Were there things going through your mind?  Were you just exhausted?  Did you feel the match got away from you?	1117_14.q	2.0	0	The Final	WIMBLEDON	Grand Slam
5274_0	Today it was good. It was a bit hot, a bit humid, but otherwise tennis was good, you know. Finally I managed to stay focused from the first point till the last. You know, didn't do any ups and downs, just took all my chances that I had, and win in straight sets.	5274_0.a	2013-09-01	M	5274	Julien Benneteau	Tomas Berdych	How was your play today, and how do you feel like going to the next round?	5274_0.q	5.0	1	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1953_0	Well, I think it's good for the players who are participating in this tournament because you have three matches guaranteed. The round robin system is something that we tried to put into the regular tournaments, but it didn't work out in the end. But I think in Masters Cup, in World Tour Finals, it's actually good. In my situation maybe not now, because my destiny doesn't depend from myself, and didn't today. You know, but that's the way it is.	1953_0.a	2009-11-27	M	1953	Rafael Nadal	Novak Djokovic	What do you think about the Masters rules? Do you like this tournament? Is there something you don't like?	1953_0.q	3.0	1	Round Robin	BARCLAYS ATP WORLD TOUR FINALS	Masters Cup
1953_1	Well, I don't think any player should do any calculation because on the court you can't really perform your best tennis. It didn't really make any difference to me when I played in these last two years. I've tried to give maximum in every match I play. Of course, maybe you would think for the players who are playing in the last day, in the night, for Soderling, who qualified already, may be better to save some energy for semifinals, because it's more important, but... On the other hand, he's first time playing and taking part in the World Tour Finals. Every match is bringing a lot of points and a lot of prize money. So it depends how you take it. Everybody's different. But I think each match should be played a hundred percent. Maybe the fact that every set counts and every game counts that you win puts a little bit more pressure on you. But, again, it puts a kind of pressure that makes you perform best and focus on every game you play.	1953_1.a	2009-11-27	M	1953	Rafael Nadal	Novak Djokovic	You can lose the first set 6-0, but you can win the two others. With this round robin, it's becoming very important to win every game. Will that make you change, or tennis is tennis?	1953_1.q	3.0	1	Round Robin	BARCLAYS ATP WORLD TOUR FINALS	Masters Cup
1953_2	Well, I'm not saying I'm dead tired. I'm saying I'm exhausted from the season. And I think that you don't need a confirmation from my place to see that. I think it's obvious on the court that I'm not moving and I'm not that energetic as I was maybe in Paris or Basel. I think the season that I had this year has took a toll on me a little bit on this tournament. I'm not saying that I should have done some things different. Look, in that moment, you don't think about it. You try to win every match you play. Unfortunately for me, the exhaustion came in the tournament where I should have been the freshest: here. But, still, I managed to get two out of three wins. If I finish today the season, I will be very happy to finish in this way, and just hope to rest well for 2010.	1953_2.a	2009-11-27	M	1953	Rafael Nadal	Novak Djokovic	You keep tell us you're dead tired, you cannot play anymore, but yet you keep winning. How can you do that?	1953_2.q	3.0	1	Round Robin	BARCLAYS ATP WORLD TOUR FINALS	Masters Cup
1953_3	Well, look, I will try to use the same procedure I do before each match. I will behave now as I'm playing tomorrow. And if I don't, as I said, it's absolutely deserved for Davydenko if he qualifies. He played really well. There's nothing to do there. I just have to wait and see.	1953_3.a	2009-11-27	M	1953	Rafael Nadal	Novak Djokovic	You're in a very difficult position now. Obviously you have to wait and see what happens in the other match. Will you have enough time to prepare for Federer tomorrow if you learn at midnight tonight you will be playing tomorrow at 2 p.m.?	1953_3.q	3.0	1	Round Robin	BARCLAYS ATP WORLD TOUR FINALS	Masters Cup
1953_4	Well, this season was in particularly special for all of us because it brought more commitment tournaments. From my side, I have played very solid on most of the events I've played. I've played quarterfinals or more. It's not that maybe I've played too many tournaments. I had, next to the 18 tournaments that are counting as a ranking tournaments, a couple more aside. One of them was my hometown tournament I couldn't miss. You know, I think in this moment there's too many obligations, too many commitments. But there's things that we have to change, but we can't change for next year. So I guess that we will have to try. From my side I will have to try to do everything I can to put priorities on events that I have to perform my best tennis in. Those are Grand Slams and 1000 events.	1953_4.a	2009-11-27	M	1953	Rafael Nadal	Novak Djokovic	Bearing in mind what you were saying a little earlier about the schedule you've had this year, do you intend to make any changes to your schedule next year?	1953_4.q	3.0	1	Round Robin	BARCLAYS ATP WORLD TOUR FINALS	Masters Cup
1953_5	Look, Davis Cup final is unpredictable I think, even though the home advantage is very important. Obviously, Spanish players love playing in front of their crowd on clay courts, which is going to be the surface. So they are favorites. But still, you know, both Czech players, Berdych and Stepanek, didn't play from now, Paris. We're gonna see. I wouldn't rate Czechs as favorites because they have to go to Spain, but you never know what's gonna happen.	1953_5.a	2009-11-27	M	1953	Rafael Nadal	Novak Djokovic	Regarding the Davis Cup final, the two top Spanish guys look out of form. Do you think the Czech Republic has a chance against Spain?	1953_5.q	3.0	1	Round Robin	BARCLAYS ATP WORLD TOUR FINALS	Masters Cup
1953_6	Well, I apologize for that. But everybody has a day like this. There has been many press conferences and many matches I had this year. I just came in the wrong moment. So I apologize if I had a bad conference two days ago.	1953_6.a	2009-11-27	M	1953	Rafael Nadal	Novak Djokovic	You're still tired, obviously. You're answering the questions tonight intelligently and eloquently as you normally do. That wasn't the case two days ago.	1953_6.q	3.0	1	Round Robin	BARCLAYS ATP WORLD TOUR FINALS	Masters Cup
1953_7	Thank you.	1953_7.a	2009-11-27	M	1953	Rafael Nadal	Novak Djokovic	Accepted.	1953_7.q	3.0	1	Round Robin	BARCLAYS ATP WORLD TOUR FINALS	Masters Cup
4738_0	Well, it can only do positive things to my confidence. Definitely at this stage of a tournament, playing semifinals against the world No.4, somebody that I have respect for, great competitor, and being able to perform as well as I did, it's incredible. I have a great feeling about myself on the court at this moment. Now I have a two days off before the finals which gives me enough time to get ready, you know, and recover for the finals.	4738_0.a	2013-01-24	M	4738	David Ferrer	Novak Djokovic	What does a performance like that do for your confidence going into Sunday night?	4738_0.q	1.0	1	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4738_1	I definitely prefer being fitter for the final and having a little bit more time than I had in 2012. It's quite different circumstances that I have to face this time. You know, last year I played five hours in semis and had only a day and a half to recover for another six hours with Nadal. This year it hasn't been the case, and I'm very glad. I was pushed to the limit in the fourth round. Had some really physically tough matches in this tournament, and I'm glad that I went through it. Right now I feel great on the court.	4738_1.a	2013-01-24	M	4738	David Ferrer	Novak Djokovic	Do you see your preparation for the final this year being a little bit different compared to last year? Do you prefer this?	4738_1.q	1.0	1	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4738_2	Yeah, sure. Why not? It's going to be a great match, obviously. They're great rivals and also best players in the world at this moment. They will definitely perform their best for sure in semifinals. I wouldn't rate anybody as a favorite. Just considering myself, I'll be ready for whoever I play against.	4738_2.a	2013-01-24	M	4738	David Ferrer	Novak Djokovic	Would you like to see tomorrow night be a long, drawnout match?	4738_2.q	1.0	1	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4738_3	Well, I think it's logical that I watch it with more attention because I'm going to play the winner of that match. So I'm going to do analysis and make the notes, as you say, and see whoever I play against to get the right tactics for the match.	4738_3.a	2013-01-24	M	4738	David Ferrer	Novak Djokovic	Will you watch that game tomorrow night on TV as a tennis fan or mentally making notes?	4738_3.q	1.0	1	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4738_4	Of course, of course. I love tennis. Tennis is my life. I'm not just a player, I'm also a fan of this sport. I love to see these big matches. When Federer and Murray and Nadal are playing, those are the special kind of matches in Grand Slams. So hope to see something nice tomorrow night.	4738_4.a	2013-01-24	M	4738	David Ferrer	Novak Djokovic	When you're watching it, if somebody hits a brilliant winner down the line, do you go, Whoa, great shot?	4738_4.q	1.0	1	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4738_5	Have no preference.	4738_5.a	2013-01-24	M	4738	David Ferrer	Novak Djokovic	Who would you rather play?	4738_5.q	1.0	1	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4738_6	I was late because I gave a treatment to Leconte. The diagnosis we determined with my assistant is that he's definitely crazy. He needs a longterm treatment (smiling).	4738_6.a	2013-01-24	M	4738	David Ferrer	Novak Djokovic	What kind of treatment did you give Leconte?	4738_6.q	1.0	1	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4738_7	No, I haven't seen it. I haven't seen it. Is there anything particular that I had to see?	4738_7.a	2013-01-24	M	4738	David Ferrer	Novak Djokovic	In all seriousness, did you watch the women's semifinal today between Victoria and Sloane?	4738_7.q	1.0	1	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4738_8	I haven't heard about that. Sorry.	4738_8.a	2013-01-24	M	4738	David Ferrer	Novak Djokovic	There was quite a controversy about a medical treatment late in the second set.	4738_8.q	1.0	1	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4738_9	That maybe might mentally help a bit, but it's not a big advantage. Whenever I play Andy or Roger or Rafa, the top rivals, it's always small margins and small details decide a winner, especially at this stage of a tournament. So, you know, it's finals. It's really unpredictable who is going to come out as a winner.	4738_9.a	2013-01-24	M	4738	David Ferrer	Novak Djokovic	If you were to play Andy, would you take any confidence in the fact that after the US Open final you got a couple of wins against him at the end of last year? Would that be a boost?	4738_9.q	1.0	1	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4738_10	You know, this twoday break definitely serves me well, you know, physically, mentally, emotionally, so I can get all my strength for that final. I'm gonna be expecting I have to be ready to expect a fivehour match or five sets. That's the kind of approach that I have to every single match that I play on on Grand Slams, especially in the second week. No other thoughts than that one. And of course I'm going to try to go out on the court and win whoever I have across the net.	4738_10.a	2013-01-24	M	4738	David Ferrer	Novak Djokovic	When you go into a match against those guys, is it a different feeling going in mentally knowing you might have to be out there five hours?	4738_10.q	1.0	1	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
4738_11	No. No, I don't.	4738_11.a	2013-01-24	M	4738	David Ferrer	Novak Djokovic	Do you make use of anything like that pressurized egg chamber which you were known to use at the US Open? Do you have one of them out here in Australia at all?	4738_11.q	1.0	1	Semifinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
6091_0	I don't know (smiling). The plan was to play more to his backhand and then with my backhand down the line to go for downtheline shots. That was the main plan, you know, to not go too much to his forehand, because he has, you know, the nicest and the most dangerous forehand I think in the world. Yeah, that was the plan. Plan is always to serve well. Sometimes it works; sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes serve is half of the win already.	6091_0.a	2014-06-01	M	6091	Roger Federer	Ernests Gulbis	You didn't want to tell us earlier what your plan was. You said you didn't want to reveal your cards. Now, can you tell us how you pulled that off?	6091_0.q	17.0	1	4th Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6091_1	Yeah, it was my back and the hamstring, they were getting a little bit tight. Yeah, I'm honest, I'm not big on medical timeouts. I don't like to take it, but I take it when it's really necessary. It probably was my third medical timeout in life. I didn't want to take it in the fifth set, so I took it in the end of the fourth set. Unfortunately it was before his serve. I don't like to do it, but I just had to do it. Otherwise I was scared a little bit to pull a muscle, and I had already a tear in the muscle in that area. So I just was being cautious.	6091_1.a	2014-06-01	M	6091	Roger Federer	Ernests Gulbis	Was it your back? I mean, you took a timeout.	6091_1.q	17.0	1	4th Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6091_2	What is all the way (smiling)?	6091_2.a	2014-06-01	M	6091	Roger Federer	Ernests Gulbis	On the last win and back in the quarterfinals for the first time since 2008. How does it feel and do you think you can go all the way now?	6091_2.q	17.0	1	4th Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6091_3	Hopefully. Feels great. Not much to say how it can feel.	6091_3.a	2014-06-01	M	6091	Roger Federer	Ernests Gulbis	Ernests knows best?	6091_3.q	17.0	1	4th Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6091_4	I don't like to see it that way. I like to see I went for my shots and I made winners. If you see those two games, I was really aggressive on my return, and I just went for the shots. I didn't want to go for longer, for long rallies, because I felt a little bit stiff right after the treatment. So I honestly don't think that he was that flat. Again, I know the feeling, you know, it's not nice to sit there for three minutes and to wait for somebody, but it's part of it, what can I do?	6091_4.a	2014-06-01	M	6091	Roger Federer	Ernests Gulbis	Were you surprised by how kind of flat Roger seemed to be after the medical timeout? After just coming out the rest of the match, it seemed like he was missing a little bit more than he was before.	6091_4.q	17.0	1	4th Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6091_5	Probably the most important, especially because it was five sets, you know, because I had I beat him before, but it was a threeset match, you know. So for my confidence and just for me as a tennis player, a fiveset win over Roger Federer, it's really big.	6091_5.a	2014-06-01	M	6091	Roger Federer	Ernests Gulbis	I think you said on court it was the best win of your career. Why would you say that?	6091_5.q	17.0	1	4th Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6091_6	There I was lucky, I have to say. I was really lucky then. In the second set he had a smash and I guess the place, the place where he could  I don't know, I guess I just didn't move a lot. I stayed in one place. He smashed right onto me. So, yeah, that was a bit lucky.	6091_6.a	2014-06-01	M	6091	Roger Federer	Ernests Gulbis	How important was the end of the second set? Do you think that was the key to the match?	6091_6.q	17.0	1	4th Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6091_7	Yes, it is. It is. But the crowd wasn't that bad. Of course, if you play Roger wherever in the world, you know, the crowd is going to be against you. That's just what you have to take. I know how Paris crowd can get, you know, but I just didn't I was trying not to show too much emotion except one broken racquet, but one is nothing for me (laughter). So I tried not to give them too much things to whistle about or to yeah, that was important for me was in the fifth set to get an early break, because if it would get tight, you know, the crowd can push you down.	6091_7.a	2014-06-01	M	6091	Roger Federer	Ernests Gulbis	Is it difficult to play against someone with the support of the crowd?	6091_7.q	17.0	1	4th Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6091_8	"I didn't understand two words, ""gratify"" and ""justify."" My English is not..."	6091_8.a	2014-06-01	M	6091	Roger Federer	Ernests Gulbis	You're very confident going into the match. You have said things in the past that got people a little bit riled up and bent out of shape. Are you gratified you can come through with a big win like this and sort of justify a lot of your outspoken, freewheeling comments?	6091_8.q	17.0	1	4th Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6091_9	Yeah, but I have to say what I think, you know. I cannot speak what I don't feel. I'm not for me is the most easy thing in life, you know, just to speak the truth. Then if you lie, then you start to forget what did you lie, and then you go into lie and lying more. So for me it's real easy to speak what's on my mind. Even take the consequences. I like it. I like, if you ask me, I tell you my opinion. Everybody is entitled to their opinion. If I feel confident about the match, I tell you that I feel confident. If you ask me two years ago, you know, if I would play him here when I was ranked lower, was I confident to go in this match, I would say no. Simple as that.	6091_9.a	2014-06-01	M	6091	Roger Federer	Ernests Gulbis	Does it feel good to be able to get this job done on a big court when you speak so freely about your confidence and other things?	6091_9.q	17.0	1	4th Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6091_10	I don't remember much about that particular game, honestly. I was just happy that I could serve it out. Yeah, it was an early break, but I don't remember really how did I get the break. I don't remember the feeling.	6091_10.a	2014-06-01	M	6091	Roger Federer	Ernests Gulbis	Were you surprised at the loose game he played in the fifth set early on? Because he never was able to dig himself out of that situation. It was a very quick game with a lot of errors. Did that surprise you?	6091_10.q	17.0	1	4th Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6091_11	Yeah, but he's also a human being, you know. I had more or less the clear game plan, you know. I had to play on his backhand, you know. And from backhand he makes these unforced errors. Actually, you know, when it's a tight moment, you know, he's Roger Federer, but he also gets tight, you know. He's also, I think he gets, maybe he wanted to finish the point a little bit earlier. I remember actually he missed the forehand wide when he was going for the shot, and that happens, you know. He's probably gonna make 7 out of 10, you know. Other guys are going to make 2 out of 10. Mistakes happen.	6091_11.a	2014-06-01	M	6091	Roger Federer	Ernests Gulbis	He made unforced errors.	6091_11.q	17.0	1	4th Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6091_12	Yes, for sure. For sure. If you see the rankings, you see everything. It's a big upset. It's a big win for me.	6091_12.a	2014-06-01	M	6091	Roger Federer	Ernests Gulbis	Do you consider this an upset, your win?	6091_12.q	17.0	1	4th Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6091_13	No.	6091_13.a	2014-06-01	M	6091	Roger Federer	Ernests Gulbis	Before you won the last point, did you feel at any point you had the match?	6091_13.q	17.0	1	4th Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6091_14	Why bad?	6091_14.a	2014-06-01	M	6091	Roger Federer	Ernests Gulbis	Do you feel that your racquets do something to you? Because you treat them really bad. Come on.	6091_14.q	17.0	1	4th Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6091_15	Yeah, yeah, but I have to respect every court, you know. I have to break at least one racquet on every court of the world. Otherwise if I would show too much disrespect to Paris center court and I cannot allow this to myself (laughter). I just had to do it.	6091_15.a	2014-06-01	M	6091	Roger Federer	Ernests Gulbis	You punish them.	6091_15.q	17.0	1	4th Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6091_16	For sure I'm going to behave better here than I would behave in when it's 10 people watching. Yeah, it's a mental thing, for sure. This crowd is tough, you know. You have to keep your emotions more in line. It actually helped me. You know, the less I talk the better I play. I need tough crowd.	6091_16.a	2014-06-01	M	6091	Roger Federer	Ernests Gulbis	Do you think in any way knowing that the crowd here was waiting for any chance it could get to boo you, do you think that kept you on better behavior and maybe your focus tighter than sometimes it can be?	6091_16.q	17.0	1	4th Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6091_17	I love support. I want support. Of course I want support. I think against Berdych it's not going to be so much for him or for me. It's going to be more even.	6091_17.a	2014-06-01	M	6091	Roger Federer	Ernests Gulbis	You are hoping they're against you again against Berdych or you want support?	6091_17.q	17.0	1	4th Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6091_18	I think...	6091_18.a	2014-06-01	M	6091	Roger Federer	Ernests Gulbis	Do you think it's a good symbol for a kid to smash a racquet not only with the hand but also with the foot and then give him as a gift, like it was a good thing like...	6091_18.q	17.0	1	4th Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6091_19	I think it's a great gift. I would be really happy if a tennis player gives me his broken racquet. He can refuse it if he doesn't want to take a gift, he can sit down and say, No, Ernests, I don't want it. It's all about choices in life. We all have choices. I can have a choice to break a racquet and get a penalty. The kid can have the choice to take it or not. I think he did a great choice (laughter).	6091_19.a	2014-06-01	M	6091	Roger Federer	Ernests Gulbis	You think it's a good gift?	6091_19.q	17.0	1	4th Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6091_20	It's too early for me to say. I like grass also. I like faster surfaces. For me it is all about ways to get used to the surface. This year I was really happy that I had just one bad tournament on clay. It was MonteCarlo. Because usually, you know, I had two or three bad tournaments in the start of the clay court season. And I just kept I just started to go, you know, only for Rome and Madrid time usually. And now I started already to play well in Barcelona. So this was really important for me. This was what I told my coach Gunther, I want to concentrate on the first tournament. If I can win a Grand Slam, hopefully I can win a Grand Slam on any surface. But if it's my best, I wouldn't say that, no.	6091_20.a	2014-06-01	M	6091	Roger Federer	Ernests Gulbis	Do you actually think that the clay would be your best chance of winning a Grand Slam?	6091_20.q	17.0	1	4th Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6091_21	I haven't played him when he was, let's say, at his complete prime time. The way he hits the forehand, it's unbelievable for me. You know, the wrist action that he has in this shot, this is something special. This is, let's say, what he has, what Rafa has in his wrist action. Not many players have it. This is special. But his backhand, I don't know if it was more stable or not. I consider my backhand I honestly consider my backhand as one of the best shots on tour, the backhand cross court and backhand down the line. I feel the ball great on this shot. I went from my strongest position to his weakest position. But I cannot say, you know. I haven't played him couple years ago. Not couple years ago, but that many matches back then.	6091_21.a	2014-06-01	M	6091	Roger Federer	Ernests Gulbis	Is there an element of older guy/younger guy? When you're pounding that backhand across the court to his backhand do you feel you've gotten to be a little bit too much for him?	6091_21.q	17.0	1	4th Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6091_22	Nothing (smiling). The less, the better. Element of surprise, it's always nice.	6091_22.a	2014-06-01	M	6091	Roger Federer	Ernests Gulbis	A lot of people are going to be wondering who is this guy who beat Roger Federer. We know you fairly well, but what do you want the casual tennis fan to know about you?	6091_22.q	17.0	1	4th Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6091_23	That's not my priority at all. Again, I want to be myself. I'm not competing with anybody. Not to entertain you, not to give you great quotes. If it happens, it happens. If not, you can write that I am boring and that I don't like something, that's fine with me. About questions to myself, I did ask myself a couple of times, but once really seriously, and this was when I played I exactly remember when I played challenger in Eckental I asked for a wildcard. I didn't get the wildcard. I had to play qualifying there. I made the final there, so it was an okay week, but it was just end of the year and in the middle of nowhere. In winter it was really depressing, and I thought honestly or I start to do something or this is for what I do it. So that was one big question.	6091_23.a	2014-06-01	M	6091	Roger Federer	Ernests Gulbis	I'm sure you have been asked many, many times why, since 2008, you haven't been able to go farther in the slams and so on. How many times did you ask the question to yourself? What answer did you give to yourself? Another question is many people say that Ivanisevic and Safin were the best entertainers in the interviews. Would you like to beat them?	6091_23.q	17.0	1	4th Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6091_24	The answer so this is the answer.	6091_24.a	2014-06-01	M	6091	Roger Federer	Ernests Gulbis	And what was the answer?	6091_24.q	17.0	1	4th Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6091_25	Could be a potential finalist (laughter).	6091_25.a	2014-06-01	M	6091	Roger Federer	Ernests Gulbis	Novak is on his way to the court. Potential semis matchup.	6091_25.q	17.0	1	4th Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6091_26	Hopefully it's going to change me that I become more confident about myself, you know, on a tennis court. Change is good, you know. Just what kind of change? Everybody changes. How can you say that you were the same person five years ago? You know, how can you say that you were the same person yesterday? Something can happen in your life. Change comes, you know. With Novak, it's just a normal thing from being a young kid growing up in Munich Academy. We used to go out together, you know, in a nightclub, and then after all the success what he has he has to be more focused. You cannot spend your I call it the life energy, you know. You cannot spend your life energy on so many stuff, you know, because everybody wants a piece of you then. The interviews, you know, the friends come up, you know, so you have to block yourself in a way, and you don't need to lose your inner beliefs, you know, and that's it. But if you can ask answer your own question that, listen, did I change or did I not change, it's all up to you, you know. And I cannot be responsible what, let's say, what you think about me, you know. This is your thoughts. I can just try to make an impression. But also sometimes you don't want to make any impression.	6091_26.a	2014-06-01	M	6091	Roger Federer	Ernests Gulbis	You know each other for a long time, and you said the success kind of changed him. I wonder, what is your relationship today and do you think such a big win like today might change you too?	6091_26.q	17.0	1	4th Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6091_27	Hard work and dedication, like Floyd Mayweather said in his interview. Hard work and dedication. That's the key.	6091_27.a	2014-06-01	M	6091	Roger Federer	Ernests Gulbis	You have been improving on your game and your performance for the last year and a little bit more. What do you think is the key on these improvements, and what do you feel you need to improve more to achieve your further goals?	6091_27.q	17.0	1	4th Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6091_28	Yes. These are good words. Hard work and dedication. It's all about hard work. You cannot have good results without hard work. That's what I understood. What else I understood is that I start enjoy, you know, things much more if I did my work. I don't enjoy life to the fullest if I didn't do my whole life, my job, you know. You know, this is for everybody of us. We did something good, we work hard for one week and then for sure on Saturday and Sunday we can enjoy that Saturday and Sunday much better. Or if we stay at home, you know, drink beer all day and not do nothing, Saturday and Sunday, what, it comes again? We get drunk again. It's only after hard work we can enjoy, we can enjoy life. That's what I found out.	6091_28.a	2014-06-01	M	6091	Roger Federer	Ernests Gulbis	Floyd Mayweather?	6091_28.q	17.0	1	4th Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6091_29	I don't know. Now I don't know. I haven't thought about it at all. I just came from this match. So honestly I have no idea. We'll see.	6091_29.a	2014-06-01	M	6091	Roger Federer	Ernests Gulbis	What can you say about the next match? What will be the key to beating Tomas?	6091_29.q	17.0	1	4th Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6129_0	It was a great feeling to play on this court. Yeah, I expected it, everything that came after. He lost one match here in ten years or something, so I knew that it's gonna be the biggest challenge in my tennis career.	6129_0.a	2014-05-29	M	6129	Rafael Nadal	Dominic Thiem	First big match on Chatrier. Can you speak about your feeling? How hard is it to play against Rafael Nadal?	6129_0.q	57.0	0	2nd Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6129_1	I started okay, yes. In general, I didn't play bad. I played okay match. Of course, I tried to play my game all game long.	6129_1.a	2014-05-29	M	6129	Rafael Nadal	Dominic Thiem	You did not seem very intimidated, given all that and knowing all that about him. You seemed to go out and find your game right away?	6129_1.q	57.0	0	2nd Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6129_2	I was learning a lot from today's match, for sure. It's really important to play against these guys a lot, against these top guys, because it's more important than every practice, I think. I hope I can take a lot with me from this match.	6129_2.a	2014-05-29	M	6129	Rafael Nadal	Dominic Thiem	You said that maybe in two or three years' time is your time to play against like big players, but I was wondering which kind of outcome you can take from today. Because actually, you could find some ways to hurt him, as well.	6129_2.q	57.0	0	2nd Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6129_3	Of course. But it's not the only thing I have to improve. Especially against Nadal, who gives you a lot of pressure. It's not easy to come close to that baseline. I think Djokovic is the only player who does that against him. It was clear for me that I couldn't make it in my first match against him.	6129_3.a	2014-05-29	M	6129	Rafael Nadal	Dominic Thiem	Don't you think you have to improve your position on court to try and play not so far, much closer to the baseline, to struggle less?	6129_3.q	57.0	0	2nd Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6129_4	Of course he gave me some advices, but I cannot play his style of game because he has unbelievable first serve. Even against Nadal he can, he has a lot of free points with the serve, and I'm a different player. So of course he gave me advices, but we are two different players. It's not really possible.	6129_4.a	2014-05-29	M	6129	Rafael Nadal	Dominic Thiem	Did you get any advices from Ernests before the match?	6129_4.q	57.0	0	2nd Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6129_5	He had some tough majors, but he won also a lot. I think everybody wants this crisis, which everybody says he has. I don't think he has. I think he played quite a good match, didn't make many mistakes. But I think there are only a few players who can hurt him in this tournament.	6129_5.a	2014-05-29	M	6129	Rafael Nadal	Dominic Thiem	Nadal had some tough matches this year on clay. Do you think he's maybe a bit more vulnerable than in the past, or do you think he's just as strong as the player who won, you know, eight titles here?	6129_5.q	57.0	0	2nd Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6129_6	I played okay. I did a lot of rookie mistakes, but against a player like him, yeah, you always want to keep the points short. I didn't want it, but, yeah, it's tough. His game, yeah, it was pretty much what I expected.	6129_6.a	2014-05-29	M	6129	Rafael Nadal	Dominic Thiem	What were you most pleased about in your own game today? And what surprised you most about Rafa's game?	6129_6.q	57.0	0	2nd Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6129_7	I think the conditions today, they took it away a little bit, the spin, because it was a little bit soft court. So the topspin wasn't that aggressive, but still it's tough to handle it. I really like my backhand down the line, but against him, it was a little bit more difficult to control.	6129_7.a	2014-05-29	M	6129	Rafael Nadal	Dominic Thiem	Many players say that his ball just arrives differently because of his extreme spin and things like that. What was your did you have any trouble handling that? Did you find it different from other players?	6129_7.q	57.0	0	2nd Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
6129_8	He doesn't give you anything. I was serving 213, 215, even on the line, and he brings the returns back. I think he made two mistakes on second serve, so you have to play every rally. My serve is not enough pressure, so it was basically I played my service games, it was the same like he served, so of course this was a little bit difficult for me.	6129_8.a	2014-05-29	M	6129	Rafael Nadal	Dominic Thiem	What is the most difficult challenge against him?	6129_8.q	57.0	0	2nd Round	ROLAND GARROS	Grand Slam
4524_0	Yeah, I think I played very good today. And I finished quite fast, which is great for me. Looking forward to next match.	4524_0.a	2012-08-27	M	4524	nan	Ivan Dodig	You must be very happy with your performance today.	4524_0.q	118.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4524_1	Yeah, today was very tough to play. For the players that are sweating a lot, it's not easy. I mean, we are used to it. I think for everyone is same, so... It's tough, but we have to play.	4524_1.a	2012-08-27	M	4524	nan	Ivan Dodig	Andy was saying that conditions were tough out there; it was very humid.	4524_1.q	118.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4524_2	Yeah, I mean, for me it's great. I will be really, really happy to play on big court. I have some experience with some other guys, but with him it's first time for me. Of course I will try to go on the match to play my best tennis. In the end, we will see how it's going to be.	4524_2.a	2012-08-27	M	4524	nan	Ivan Dodig	You play Andy Murray now. You've never played him before. Good chance for you to play on a big court and maybe cause an upset?	4524_2.q	118.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4524_3	I mean, he is the top player. He's from all sides playing good. With these guys, it's very tough. You have to play over your limit. We are all human being, but he has the chance on the court. If you go with this concentration on the court that you can beat everyone, you have the chance. Of course it's going to be tough, but I have to focus on my game and try to play my best on the court.	4524_3.a	2012-08-27	M	4524	nan	Ivan Dodig	What makes him so difficult to play? I know you never played him before. What are his big strengths?	4524_3.q	118.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4524_4	Well, it's tough to say now, you know, but I have to see little bit, you know, like how he's playing. I didn't watch him a lot. But of course I have to be aggressive. I have to risk a lot and hope that everything will go in the court.	4524_4.a	2012-08-27	M	4524	nan	Ivan Dodig	Where do you feel you might be able to trouble him?	4524_4.q	118.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4524_5	Yeah, for me is the best win. I had some experience with these top10 players. I beat as well Tsonga on grass and Soderling. So we will see. I like to play these matches, and I hope Wednesday I will play as well good.	4524_5.a	2012-08-27	M	4524	nan	Ivan Dodig	You beat Rafa. Is that the best win of your career?	4524_5.q	118.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4524_6	Yeah, I was struggling like half year. Had some problem in my back. Finally now I'm again fit and I start to practice much better. I hope the second part after US Open would be much better for me. I hope my ranking going to be again what I want it to be.	4524_6.a	2012-08-27	M	4524	nan	Ivan Dodig	Your ranking has been falling this year. Is there a particular reason for that?	4524_6.q	118.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4524_7	No, I think is for me like these four players, everybody can beat everybody. Of course with these Olympics he showed that he's ready for big things, so we will see. Everybody exciting about him.	4524_7.a	2012-08-27	M	4524	nan	Ivan Dodig	Do the other players see Andy Murray differently now that he's won the Olympics or does it not compare to a Grand Slam?	4524_7.q	118.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
4524_8	Yeah, I mean, like I said, I had some nice experience against big guys. Of course I'm looking forward to play this match. Like I said, I will try to play my best. That's only my target.	4524_8.a	2012-08-27	M	4524	nan	Ivan Dodig	There's likely to be quite an atmosphere in the match. Are you looking forward to playing on that kind of a stage?	4524_8.q	118.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
5285_0	Yeah. Four hours is a long time to be on a tennis court.	5285_0.a	2013-08-30	M	5285	Alex Bogomolov	Tim Smyczek	On the delay, same sort of issues as last time?	5285_0.q	109.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
5285_1	Yeah, yeah. Uhm, it was good. I knew coming into the match he had to be a little bit tired after the first round he had, 76 in the fifth. But, I mean, he sure didn't show it in the first set. Then after I won the second, I thought he seemed like he was maybe running out of gas at the end of the second set. He just came at me full power in the beginning of the third and broke me right away. He's got a lot in reserves. You know, it was a long one. Luckily today I was getting some free points on my serve which, you know, helped. But, yeah, it was a grind.	5285_1.a	2013-08-30	M	5285	Alex Bogomolov	Tim Smyczek	How was it? Your second fivesetter after Reynolds here last year. 20, not bad.	5285_1.q	109.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
5285_2	Yeah.	5285_2.a	2013-08-30	M	5285	Alex Bogomolov	Tim Smyczek	First time at this stage of a major.	5285_2.q	109.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
5285_3	So far so good. Uhm, I still got to, you know, sleep on it maybe. Probably get a good 12 hours tonight (smiling).	5285_3.a	2013-08-30	M	5285	Alex Bogomolov	Tim Smyczek	How does it feel?	5285_3.q	109.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
5285_4	Recovery mode. I'll go see the trainers, get a massage, probably get some takeout. If I'm able to stay awake until the takeout gets to my room, then I'll eat some.	5285_4.a	2013-08-30	M	5285	Alex Bogomolov	Tim Smyczek	That was going to be my question. You just played four hours on a Friday night in New York. What are your plans after this?	5285_4.q	109.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
5285_5	Yeah, it has been a long road. You know, it's great. Like I said, so far so good. Maybe I'll have more for you tomorrow.	5285_5.a	2013-08-30	M	5285	Alex Bogomolov	Tim Smyczek	What does it mean to you to make it to the third round of a slam? You're not young.	5285_5.q	109.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
5285_6	No. I mean, I've had chances. I've played in several main draws. You know, I've always thought I could. It makes me really happy. Obviously it's been a long time for it to happen the first time now when I'm 25. But, you know, I'm just looking ahead and looking at the next match, and I'm really excited.	5285_6.a	2013-08-30	M	5285	Alex Bogomolov	Tim Smyczek	Are you still in disbelief or what?	5285_6.q	109.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
5285_7	I don't know him. Have to get a good scouting report.	5285_7.a	2013-08-30	M	5285	Alex Bogomolov	Tim Smyczek	You have Granollers. Do you know him?	5285_7.q	109.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
5285_8	Yeah. But don't know much about him.	5285_8.a	2013-08-30	M	5285	Alex Bogomolov	Tim Smyczek	You've seen him play, obviously.	5285_8.q	109.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
5285_9	I think he comes in a fair amount.	5285_9.a	2013-08-30	M	5285	Alex Bogomolov	Tim Smyczek	Good serve.	5285_9.q	109.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
5285_10	Loud grunter? I'll grunt back.	5285_10.a	2013-08-30	M	5285	Alex Bogomolov	Tim Smyczek	Loud grunter.	5285_10.q	109.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
5285_11	Is that right? I know Sock plays Tipsarevic. Do you know who Isner plays?	5285_11.a	2013-08-30	M	5285	Alex Bogomolov	Tim Smyczek	It's just you and Sock and Isner left.	5285_11.q	109.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
5285_12	Yeah, I mean, I know all of us Americans have a pretty good rapport, and we're all pulling for each other. Even Rajeev. Saw him in the locker room. He came up to me and said he was really happy for me. I think it's pretty cool the way we all get along pretty well.	5285_12.a	2013-08-30	M	5285	Alex Bogomolov	Tim Smyczek	Kohlschreiber.	5285_12.q	109.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
5285_13	If that's what it takes, yeah. The guy that rescued us has been walking me to and from matches, so I'm going to keep that going.	5285_13.a	2013-08-30	M	5285	Alex Bogomolov	Tim Smyczek	Planning on running out of gas at more majors?	5285_13.q	109.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
5285_14	Yeah. He doesn't work for transportation. He's the one that picked us up on the side of the road. So then after my firstround match, I don't think this is his job, but he escorted me from the court back to the locker room. Then he did the same thing to the court and from the court today. Hopefully we can keep that going.	5285_14.a	2013-08-30	M	5285	Alex Bogomolov	Tim Smyczek	He was the guy driving the car that rescued you?	5285_14.q	109.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
5285_15	Yeah, he's looking after me. I got to get him something nice at the end of the week.	5285_15.a	2013-08-30	M	5285	Alex Bogomolov	Tim Smyczek	He's worried about you.	5285_15.q	109.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
5285_16	No, no, it was just gas. We were coasting for a good mile or so. It wasn't engine trouble.	5285_16.a	2013-08-30	M	5285	Alex Bogomolov	Tim Smyczek	There's some chatter that maybe the car broke down.	5285_16.q	109.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
5285_17	Right, no. I got a couple of tweets, too, that people were like telling me, Maybe you can fill up your gas tank now. I don't think they know that it wasn't my car.	5285_17.a	2013-08-30	M	5285	Alex Bogomolov	Tim Smyczek	It was not mechanical?	5285_17.q	109.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
5285_18	It's a good day.	5285_18.a	2013-08-30	M	5285	Alex Bogomolov	Tim Smyczek	All these prize money increases, not a bad payday for you.	5285_18.q	109.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
5285_19	I made a deal with my coach Billy if I made the third round of a slam this year I was going to buy him a set of golf clubs. That's going to be my major purchase.	5285_19.a	2013-08-30	M	5285	Alex Bogomolov	Tim Smyczek	Do you have your sights on anything?	5285_19.q	109.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
5285_20	Yeah, I was born outside of Milwaukee.	5285_20.a	2013-08-30	M	5285	Alex Bogomolov	Tim Smyczek	Could you bring us up to speed on your Wisconsin connections, background.	5285_20.q	109.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
5285_21	I guess I was born in Milwaukee. I lived in Franklin. Then when I was maybe eight or nine we moved to Hales Corners. My parents are still there. My sister is in grad school at Madison. My brother is a lawyer in Milwaukee. Still try and go back there as often as possible. I'll probably head home right after here.	5285_21.a	2013-08-30	M	5285	Alex Bogomolov	Tim Smyczek	What town?	5285_21.q	109.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
5285_22	No, not much up in Madison. We were all Milwaukee. I follow the Badgers because of my sister. There's a little riff in the family because my brother went to Notre Dame. Kind of torn.	5285_22.a	2013-08-30	M	5285	Alex Bogomolov	Tim Smyczek	Did you play much in the tennis center there? Are you a Badger fan?	5285_22.q	109.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
5285_23	Yeah, when the draw came out I saw I played Duckworth. You know, he's really dangerous. He's had some good wins this year already. You know, I didn't by any means take him lightly. When I saw it, my first reaction was, That's a little bit more pressure on me. But, you know, I was lucky to get through that one. Then Paire I think was serving 54 in the fifth. I was expecting to play him. Then I saw I was going to play Bogey. You know, I know Bogey so well, and I know that I don't usually like to play him. He kind of does a lot of the same things I do on the court. I knew it was going to be a battle. I didn't really feel fortunate at all walking out on the court. On paper it's a good draw, but there aren't too many good draws here.	5285_23.a	2013-08-30	M	5285	Alex Bogomolov	Tim Smyczek	When you saw your draw here, Duckworth, Bogomolov, not seeds, did you feel like you had more of an opportunity here?	5285_23.q	109.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
5285_24	Yeah. But he took out Rajeev, who beat Fognini. Killed Fognini. For me, I'm ranked a hundred something in the world. Pretty much everyone I face from here on in is going to be ranked ahead of me. Yeah, I don't have to play Roger or Rafa, but they're all tough draws.	5285_24.a	2013-08-30	M	5285	Alex Bogomolov	Tim Smyczek	It sort of continues. Another unseeded guy next round.	5285_24.q	109.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
5285_25	Yeah, I set a goal at the beginning of this year to break into the top 100. I got to 101 and still haven't made it, so that's still the main one for me. Then just, you know, cementing myself inside there, setting myself up for getting into all the Grand Slams next year. You know, can't really set new goals until you've reached the last one, so...	5285_25.a	2013-08-30	M	5285	Alex Bogomolov	Tim Smyczek	What do you want to do in the next year or two? Talk about your hopes.	5285_25.q	109.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
5285_26	That's the plan right now.	5285_26.a	2013-08-30	M	5285	Alex Bogomolov	Tim Smyczek	Will you play a bunch of challengers after the Open? Go out to California?	5285_26.q	109.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
5285_27	It starts in Napa. I'm not sure if Tiburon is first or Sacramento. One of the two. I don't know which order they go in.	5285_27.a	2013-08-30	M	5285	Alex Bogomolov	Tim Smyczek	Do you know what you're playing? Tiburon?	5285_27.q	109.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
5285_28	Really?	5285_28.a	2013-08-30	M	5285	Alex Bogomolov	Tim Smyczek	For top 100, I think you're projected at 100.	5285_28.q	109.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
5285_29	I was talking with Denis Kudla about this in the locker room. He's trying to do his schedule. He was talking about there's several guys still in the draw that are in between 115 and 90. It will be a lot of shuffling around, I'm sure.	5285_29.a	2013-08-30	M	5285	Alex Bogomolov	Tim Smyczek	But the rankings don't come out for another week.	5285_29.q	109.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
5285_30	Yeah, 100 is the goal.	5285_30.a	2013-08-30	M	5285	Alex Bogomolov	Tim Smyczek	You get into slams directly at 105.	5285_30.q	109.0	1	2nd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
3434_0	Yeah, it was a tough match. I know she's a great player. She played the finals in Australian Open, won Sydney, so she's a great athlete. The last time I played her was 7-6 in the third, so I knew it was going to be tough. She had four match points in a row, so not easy to come back from that one. But I kept fighting, kept playing well, and I guess I just stayed aggressive and kept positive.	3434_0.a	2011-02-16	F	3434	Na Li	Yanina Wickmayer	Pretty good effort.	3434_0.q	25.0	1	2nd Round	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS WOMEN	Premier
3434_1	I know I saved three against Radwanska in Fed Cup. But, um, four in a row, I don't think so.	3434_1.a	2011-02-16	F	3434	Na Li	Yanina Wickmayer	Have you ever saved four match points before in a match?	3434_1.q	25.0	1	2nd Round	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS WOMEN	Premier
3434_2	Yeah, well, I wasn't playing bad. Actually, the second set I think we both played really well. We had some good rallies; both served well. I think I just made a few mistakes by trying to be aggressive. So I know I was playing well. It was just a couple balls more into the court and just went for my shots, stayed aggressive, and tried to stay positive, tried to stay in there.	3434_2.a	2011-02-16	F	3434	Na Li	Yanina Wickmayer	What were you thinking four match points down?	3434_2.q	25.0	1	2nd Round	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS WOMEN	Premier
3434_3	It's always tough to start a set when you know you had four match points, so I knew I had to start really aggressive in the third set and try to put a lot of pressure on her. I know I been there before. Also had match point in the second set and didn't make it. Every bad error that you make or every point that's not going the way want to it to, you keep thinking back on those four match points. So I was just trying to be really aggressive and not make too many mistakes and make her work for the shots. I guess when I had that break, I knew I just had to keep going and do what I was doing before.	3434_3.a	2011-02-16	F	3434	Na Li	Yanina Wickmayer	At the start of the third set as well, obviously she's going to you be on a bit of a downer having lost that out on four match points. Did you think to yourself if you really put the hammer down there it would be over, she would perhaps crumple away?	3434_3.q	25.0	1	2nd Round	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS WOMEN	Premier
3434_4	Yeah, well, she's another tough opponent. Played her a couple times. Won a few times; lost a few times. She's tough opponent, too. She's a big fighter, so it won't be easy. But, I mean, not thinking about tomorrow yet. It's been a really big one for me today, and I'll think about tomorrow when I wake up tomorrow.	3434_4.a	2011-02-16	F	3434	Na Li	Yanina Wickmayer	Tomorrow you'll be playing Shahar Peer. Talk about that.	3434_4.q	25.0	1	2nd Round	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS WOMEN	Premier
3434_5	Well, center court is a bit slower than the other courts, so especially on the returns I think everyone saw it was tough finding a rhythm. We both made a lot mistakes in the first set. Once we found our rhythm in the second set, we were both playing really well. We played some really good rallies. It was tough changing a little bit. The pace was a bit different. But once we both found our rhythm, it was a good match.	3434_5.a	2011-02-16	F	3434	Na Li	Yanina Wickmayer	What would you say the difference from the first and the final two sets for you were? What was the key to winning it? You guys were tight.	3434_5.q	25.0	1	2nd Round	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS WOMEN	Premier
5279_0	It's tough. I mean, I think it was also this year pretty close one. Maybe I'm guessing a little bit, you know, taking the right corners. I think the only good thing is that I try to make him move a lot. I don't go for winners, or like with the first serve I try to have high percentage. I think that's one of the key moments that, yeah, I'm able to move him around. Maybe he doesn't, yeah, like being pushed from corner to corner. I don't know. I played very well today, and also last year. It's always tough, but it was like I said very good match for me today.	5279_0.a	2013-08-31	M	5279	John Isner	Philipp Kohlschreiber	What is it about your game that seems to have matched up against John so well here the last couple of years?	5279_0.q	25.0	1	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
5279_1	I don't know what's there went, but before was just I don't know who was it, but one guy was really between first and second always saying, Come on, and, Let's go John, like really aggressive during my motion. I turned around and said to him, Well, I don't think that's a nice thing what you do. Then I said to the umpire it should be his duty to keep the people a little bit down, you know. It's not Davis Cup and it should be fair. After that, I think everything was fine.	5279_1.a	2013-08-31	M	5279	John Isner	Philipp Kohlschreiber	What was happening when the chair umpire went over to talk to his box?	5279_1.q	25.0	1	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
5279_2	I'm part of that? I'm sorry. Well, what shall I say? I think, yeah, it's bad luck. You know, I think John came up pretty strong for the tournament here. Maybe he was a little bit unlucky today. I had a good day. I had a great start. That gave me a lot of confidence to go into the match starting with a break. Well, for sure, it's not great for the American history not to have a player in the second week, but you had so many good years. I think John is doing pretty well. I mean, he will be playing the next Grand Slams pretty good, I think.	5279_2.a	2013-08-31	M	5279	John Isner	Philipp Kohlschreiber	If Tim Smyczek loses tomorrow, there's a chance that no Americans would be in the second week of any major this year for the first time ever. What would you make of that, and your part of that?	5279_2.q	25.0	1	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
5279_3	I think it's going to be a total different setup for the match, more rallies, maybe less service winners. But I'm really looking forward. You know, had some good matches against him, especially on hard court. Basically I know a little bit how I have to play. We don't have to say he's in pretty good shape winning almost, yeah, every match on hard court. So it's going to be really tough, but I'm really looking forward to play on Ashe. And I'm happy with my performance today. I think I also will play a really good match against him.	5279_3.a	2013-08-31	M	5279	John Isner	Philipp Kohlschreiber	What do you make of playing Nadal?	5279_3.q	25.0	1	3rd Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
774_0	Well, certainly I knew that he's the best player in the world on this surface before the match, and I was aware of that. What I was trying to do is to go out there and be aggressive, but in the same time try to be patient, which is very difficult.  Because the balls you don't get back on the hard courts you get back on the clay. He's really feeling comfortable on this surface, but I'm really satisfied with the way I played today.  Just I have time to improve.	774_0.a	2007-05-11	M	774	Rafael Nadal	Novak Djokovic	Just how good is Rafa at the moment?  He seems maybe better than ever.	774_0.q	5.0	0	Quarterfinals	INTERNAZIONALI BNL D'ITALIA (MEN)	Masters
774_1	Yeah, I always learn some new things when I play against the best players in the world.  Every match is a new experience. Yes, today I've seen, you know, what I need to improve on and what I need to do so I can play better in the next match and maybe try to win. Of course, you know, it's very difficult to play him on this surface.  It's the surface he prefers.  But, you know, I'll really do my best and then practice and try to beat him on the clay if I have the next chance. In this moment I'm really happy the way I play on clay.  Even today's performance was really good.  He was better, and that's all really.  I won last week tournament in Estoril.  Won two very difficult matches here before Nadal, and playing with a lot of confidence.  Helps me a lot.	774_1.a	2007-05-11	M	774	Rafael Nadal	Novak Djokovic	Have you learned much from today's match about how you would play him next time on clay?	774_1.q	5.0	0	Quarterfinals	INTERNAZIONALI BNL D'ITALIA (MEN)	Masters
774_2	It's one of the things, yes.  To try to, you know, put him out of the comfort zone.  You got to try to do something else, and you got to be physically really hundred percent ready.	774_2.a	2007-05-11	M	774	Rafael Nadal	Novak Djokovic	You tried to play a lot of dropshots.  Did you feel that this was the right tactic against him?	774_2.q	5.0	0	Quarterfinals	INTERNAZIONALI BNL D'ITALIA (MEN)	Masters
774_3	I worked a lot after Monte-Carlo tournament, the week after, and as well in Estoril I worked a lot on physical preparation, because I want to be physically ready for the Rome, Hamburg, and especially Roland Garros. I think here I had the very difficult matches, but today I felt pretty good on the court and I was running a lot.  You know, we had long points, long games, so I'm really happy with the way I feel now.  I'm not too tired, you know. So not too exhausted, and that's a positive thing because that was the goal at the start of the clay court season:  To prepare for the major tournaments.	774_3.a	2007-05-11	M	774	Rafael Nadal	Novak Djokovic	Were you worried at all today having won Estoril and the tough matches here the physical part of it?  You seemed to hold up physically.  Were you worried you might not be able to?	774_3.q	5.0	0	Quarterfinals	INTERNAZIONALI BNL D'ITALIA (MEN)	Masters
774_4	I'm not really in a hurry anywhere.  I'm trying to practice and to focus on my career.  And I know that I need a lot of experience and a lot of things to improve on so I can get to the place I want to be:  The best player in the world. There is time.  I'm only twenty years old this year.  I hope my career will be ten to fifteen more years long.  You know, what I will try to do is to improve more on the volleys so I can, you know, use my opportunities.  Because I have pretty good groundstrokes from the baseline, pretty powerful and aggressive, but I need to go more to the net so I can use those opportunities, and of course serve consistency. There is a lot of things.  You cannot play perfect.  There is always things you can improve on.	774_4.a	2007-05-11	M	774	Rafael Nadal	Novak Djokovic	What do you think you should improve in your playing for to be closer to him, to Roger or Nadal?	774_4.q	5.0	0	Quarterfinals	INTERNAZIONALI BNL D'ITALIA (MEN)	Masters
774_5	I think I prefer mostly hard court.  You know, clay is one of the surface I play well on as well.  You know, of course I lost straight sets against a player who didn't lose close to 18 matches in a row, so I'm not really down because of it. You know, I still have confidence and I still think that I'm one of the best players in the world on this surface as well.	774_5.a	2007-05-11	M	774	Rafael Nadal	Novak Djokovic	You play well on all surfaces.  Where do you rate clay?	774_5.q	5.0	0	Quarterfinals	INTERNAZIONALI BNL D'ITALIA (MEN)	Masters
774_6	As I said, with the balls you make winner on hard court against him or some other players, and here you get the ball back.  Here the conditions, the courts are pretty fast, so it should be better for the other players to play against him. But it seems like he likes it as well.  He can play on all kinds of surfaces.  He proved that in Wimbledon last year.  I'm aggressive type, you know, of the player.  I like to make winners, and sometimes I make a lot of unforced errors because of that.  But these are some things that I need to improve on:  Consistency and more patient.	774_6.a	2007-05-11	M	774	Rafael Nadal	Novak Djokovic	We could watch you and see that you see an opening, and that opening against most players you'll hit a winner into.  What goes through your mind when you see the opening with him and it seems like so often he can get them?	774_6.q	5.0	0	Quarterfinals	INTERNAZIONALI BNL D'ITALIA (MEN)	Masters
774_7	He's playing really fantastic tennis.  In Monte-Carlo he didn't lose a set.  Nobody had a chance against him.  Barcelona as well and here as well.  He's playing really impressive, so he's getting away.	774_7.a	2007-05-11	M	774	Rafael Nadal	Novak Djokovic	On clay this year do you think he's got further away from everyone compared to last year?	774_7.q	5.0	0	Quarterfinals	INTERNAZIONALI BNL D'ITALIA (MEN)	Masters
3647_0	Yes, is more important win. I remember in Valencia I won Ferrero, and I remember I won in Moscow Davydenko, but this one is more important.	3647_0.a	2011-03-26	M	3647	Andy Roddick	Pablo Cuevas	Would you consider that the most important victory of your career? Do you think that you would have won if Andy was healthy? Do you feel that was a problem for him?	3647_0.q	67.0	1	2nd Round	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters 1000
3647_1	Yes, yes. Yeah, (Through translation.) Yeah, it can be difficult, but I was just concentrating on what I could do and control. Only towards the end of the match I saw there was something wrong with him.	3647_1.a	2011-03-26	M	3647	Andy Roddick	Pablo Cuevas	Is it tough to play someone you know is injured, who is having a problem, breathing difficulties?	3647_1.q	67.0	1	2nd Round	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters 1000
3647_2	(Through translation.) It will be another difficult match, because, you know, he's a good player. But, you know, I'm coming with a lot of confidence, and hopefully I will play like I played today.	3647_2.a	2011-03-26	M	3647	Andy Roddick	Pablo Cuevas	You will play against Gilles Simon. How do you think the match will go?	3647_2.q	67.0	1	2nd Round	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters 1000
3647_3	(Through translation.) Yeah, towards the end of the second set maybe like 5-4 or 6-5, and then like in the tiebreak, like it was 2-Love and I played a forehand and he kind of didn't go for it. So, yeah, at that time.	3647_3.a	2011-03-26	M	3647	Andy Roddick	Pablo Cuevas	At what point did you know that he was not himself, hurt, sick, or whatever? When in the match?	3647_3.q	67.0	1	2nd Round	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters 1000
3647_4	No, no, no. (Through translation.) But I did serve very well today, like good variation, and I placed it well.	3647_4.a	2011-03-26	M	3647	Andy Roddick	Pablo Cuevas	Is that the best you ever served?	3647_4.q	67.0	1	2nd Round	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters 1000
3647_5	Yes.	3647_5.a	2011-03-26	M	3647	Andy Roddick	Pablo Cuevas	Is that kick serve that you made about six straight points on, is that your specialty?	3647_5.q	67.0	1	2nd Round	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters 1000
3647_6	(Through translation.) No, I didn't feel that it was slower than previous years, but generally all the hard court tournaments the courts are a little bit slower, so we're used to this kind of, yeah, pace.	3647_6.a	2011-03-26	M	3647	Andy Roddick	Pablo Cuevas	Are the courts slower than usual? Do you notice an advantage maybe for the clay courters because the courts are slower?	3647_6.q	67.0	1	2nd Round	SONY ERICSSON OPEN	Masters 1000
4862_0	Yeah, he played much better than me today. That's the first thing. And that's in these kind of matches the player who play better normally win, so I congratulate him.	4862_0.a	2013-11-02	M	4862	David Ferrer	Rafael Nadal	David played a very, very solid match today, and it seems like you never really found your best game out there. How did you feel?	4862_0.q	1.0	0	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS MASTERS	Masters 1000
4862_1	I need to play better, as I said before. Sometimes we find a lot of things in the sport, and the sport is very simple. Is not a big thing, you know. Just I need to play with less mistakes. I need to move quicker. I was slow. I felt that I don't move always I was a little bit late on the ball. So against a player like David, he's quick and he plays inside the court and he puts you pressure on you all the time, you are dead, no? It was like this. In the second set I had chances. Big mistake for me though in the game 5All. Because if I win that game and I put 65 on my favor, I will have a chance. But I didn't, so stupid talk about that (smiling). That's all. I need to play more aggressive on Tuesday and I need to move quicker. If I move myself quicker, I gonna have the chance to hit the ball quicker and have the chance to play with less mistakes. But basically, the most important thing is the movement.	4862_1.a	2013-11-02	M	4862	David Ferrer	Rafael Nadal	Obviously disappointed. How do you plan to change things around for London? What do you think you need to correct to do better in London?	4862_1.q	1.0	0	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS MASTERS	Masters 1000
4862_2	No. I don't have no one physical problem. Just, you know, I don't know why today I was sweating much more than previous days. I feel a little bit, you know, slower, but nothing that really should affect to my movements. That's it. Just I was not enough well this afternoon, and David was much better than me. Just the thing that I can do when these kind of thing happen is congratulate my friend and wish him the best of luck for tomorrow. I hope he will have his chance tomorrow. For me, just have tomorrow and Monday to practice a little bit in London. I need to practice as well, need to work on a few things. Very short period of time, but that's what there is. Remain one tournament. Try to play with positive attitude, best attitude I can. I think today I played no negative. Trying to be positive. Trying to fight until the end, but was not the day. That's the only thing I can do, because I know at the end of the season a lot of times the body, the mental, and the tennis is tougher for me, no? I arrived with a bit more tired, and the conditions of these courts didn't help me a lot never. So we will see what's going on. I gonna try to play better on London. In the end I played here four matches. That's positive thing for prepare for London. I don't say this is a tournament to prepare London because I don't take this tournament like this. I think this tournament is big enough important to have a preparation tournament. Again, at the end, when this tournament is over, I have to think that I had four matches here that hopefully again can work well for me to try to be quicker and try to be more dynamic next week. That's what I need.	4862_2.a	2013-11-02	M	4862	David Ferrer	Rafael Nadal	It was a strange match. You didn't seem to move as well as usual. You said you were slower than usual. Were you affected by your stomach bug, or did you have any physical problem?	4862_2.q	1.0	0	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS MASTERS	Masters 1000
4862_3	You was here? I think I answered that question a few questions ago. I said that the only thing that change is try to play more aggressive, try to play with less mistakes, try to move myself better.	4862_3.a	2013-11-02	M	4862	David Ferrer	Rafael Nadal	It's pretty unusual to get to play the same player two times in a row like you will against David. Is there anything tactically you will be thinking about from this match going into the next one, or how is that sort of different preparation than usual?	4862_3.q	1.0	0	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS MASTERS	Masters 1000
4862_4	We played I don't know how many times. Is nothing completely that I need to know, no. We know each other very well. I know what things he's doing well, and when he's playing well he's very dangerous on all the surfaces, but especially on this one, especially because it's probably the worst surface for me. We will see. I need to do a few things better. That's what I say before. Learn or not, doesn't matter. In the end, I am 27 years old. I don't have 18 or 19. All experiences are positive when you are younger. Today I know very well my opponents and I know what I have to do. The thing is if I am ready to do it or not.	4862_4.a	2013-11-02	M	4862	David Ferrer	Rafael Nadal	In terms of the matchup, did you learn anything about David's game that you can use immediately for the next time, I guess?	4862_4.q	1.0	0	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS MASTERS	Masters 1000
4862_5	I think I didn't play enough well during the whole tournament. That's my feeling. It's true that yesterday I won 64, 61, but at the same time it's true that the style of Richard is a little bit different than the style of David. Probably the style of Richard helped me a little bit to me because he plays with topspin. I have more time to think. I play a match more like a normal surface, not like indoors, no? So that helps my game. Is a different history today. David plays more like this, and if I am not very quick on my legs affects a lot to my game, no? Yesterday, even if I was not that quick, I had more time to prepare the point.	4862_5.a	2013-11-02	M	4862	David Ferrer	Rafael Nadal	You played at a very high level against Janowicz and Gasquet. When you have a day like this, do you just say, Okay, it was a bad day at the office and you forget about it, or do you get a little bit worried about what may have gone wrong?	4862_5.q	1.0	0	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS MASTERS	Masters 1000
2389_0	No, I just went out there today, and, yeah, I knew I had a chance. I beated [sic] her in s'Hertogenbosch, so I played her already. I think my advantage today was I had a few matches in my legs already. The weather and the circumstances are not that easy. So, yeah, I guess this was her first match, and I played really aggressive and started playing well from the beginning. I guess, yeah, I went through quallies so it's tough, but once you get into the main draw I guess you have a little advantage on the other players.	2389_0.a	2009-08-11	F	2389	Francesca Schiavone	Yanina Wickmayer	Congratulations on your win. You came through qualifying to get into the tournament. Did you feel in the first round match that you had something to prove and you wanted to show people, Hey, you know, I earned my way here and I want to show what my game is like?	2389_0.q	56.0	1	1st Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP WOMEN'S OPEN	Premier
2389_1	No.	2389_1.a	2009-08-11	F	2389	Francesca Schiavone	Yanina Wickmayer	Looking ahead at your next match, you play Elena. I haven't looked, but have you played her?	2389_1.q	56.0	1	1st Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP WOMEN'S OPEN	Premier
2389_2	I don't expect a lot, actually. I'm just gonna go out there and do my thing and play game and we'll see. I have nothing to prove anymore and nothing to lose tomorrow. She's the one that has to win that match. Just gonna go out there and do my thing fight for what's worth it.	2389_2.a	2009-08-11	F	2389	Francesca Schiavone	Yanina Wickmayer	What are you expecting out that match.	2389_2.q	56.0	1	1st Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP WOMEN'S OPEN	Premier
2389_3	Uh-huh.	2389_3.a	2009-08-11	F	2389	Francesca Schiavone	Yanina Wickmayer	You're playing doubles with Kim.	2389_3.q	56.0	1	1st Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP WOMEN'S OPEN	Premier
2389_4	We haven't had a chance to practice yet. I played my matches every day, and she had played yesterday late so she was having a rest during the day. Actually we haven't had the chance. I guess we'll go out there today and play and see we'll what's gonna happen. We'll, yeah, try to figure out a way to win our first match. I hope we can maybe warm-up together tomorrow or maybe hit tomorrow. We'll see.	2389_4.a	2009-08-11	F	2389	Francesca Schiavone	Yanina Wickmayer	Do you have a chance to practice with her, or do you just kind of meet on the court?	2389_4.q	56.0	1	1st Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP WOMEN'S OPEN	Premier
2389_5	Yeah, I guess we're friends. We don't have any problems with each other. No, I practice with her a few times when I came here. But, yeah, she's new for me. I mean, I haven't met her on tour yet. By the time she was playing I wasn't there yet. It's the first tournament we're gonna play together even singles and doubles. Yeah, we'll see.	2389_5.a	2009-08-11	F	2389	Francesca Schiavone	Yanina Wickmayer	Are you guys friends off the court?	2389_5.q	56.0	1	1st Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP WOMEN'S OPEN	Premier
2389_6	Well, actually I was pretty bored two days ago, so I guess just came into my mind to do my nails. Sometimes I do them. I guess, yeah, it's kind of in the color of my clothes. I was just bord. We have to do something to pass our time, right?	2389_6.a	2009-08-11	F	2389	Francesca Schiavone	Yanina Wickmayer	Your fingernails are every other color. Is that something you do for fun or superstition?	2389_6.q	56.0	1	1st Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP WOMEN'S OPEN	Premier
2389_7	Yeah, I saw hers, but I saw different colors. I just thought, let's go for it. Blue and pink.	2389_7.a	2009-08-11	F	2389	Francesca Schiavone	Yanina Wickmayer	Maybe you saw Serena. She had yellow ones.	2389_7.q	56.0	1	1st Round	WESTERN & SOUTHERN FINANCIAL GROUP WOMEN'S OPEN	Premier
5521_0	I felt I played quite a solid match. You know, first rounds of a tournament can always be a bit more nerve wracking. Just happy that I went out there and took point by point and took care of business on my end.	5521_0.a	2014-06-10	F	5521	Kurumi Nara	Johanna Konta	Well done today. How did you feel you played?	5521_0.q	110.0	1	1st Round	AEGON CLASSIC	International
5521_1	Not necessarily. I guess confidence maybe in the way that I knew roughly what to expect. I had a clear game plan. However, obviously she's been playing well lately. She won her first WTA earlier in the year, so I was expecting her to be in good form and she is in good form. I just managed to win some key points during the match. I don't think the scoreline really shows how the match was.	5521_1.a	2014-06-10	F	5521	Kurumi Nara	Johanna Konta	When you saw her in the draw, you obviously have a great record against her and you beat her last year, didn't you? Did that fill you with confidence straightaway?	5521_1.q	110.0	1	1st Round	AEGON CLASSIC	International
5521_2	Just do as well as I can, really. I take it match by match and point by point even. So we'll see how it goes.	5521_2.a	2014-06-10	F	5521	Kurumi Nara	Johanna Konta	What are your hopes for this tournament and going forward into the grass court season?	5521_2.q	110.0	1	1st Round	AEGON CLASSIC	International
5521_3	I haven't looked at the draw.	5521_3.a	2014-06-10	F	5521	Kurumi Nara	Johanna Konta	It's Heather next up, isn't it?	5521_3.q	110.0	1	1st Round	AEGON CLASSIC	International
5521_4	Okay.	5521_4.a	2014-06-10	F	5521	Kurumi Nara	Johanna Konta	If she wins today, it's Heather.	5521_4.q	110.0	1	1st Round	AEGON CLASSIC	International
5521_5	I would like to see when the match finishes first to see who I play. I've played her once last year and we didn't finish the match. She was not well. It'll be fun. It's in front of a British crowd it'll be interesting, good atmosphere. Yeah, no I'm looking forward to it if that will be the case.	5521_5.a	2014-06-10	F	5521	Kurumi Nara	Johanna Konta	What are your thoughts on facing Heather? She's a set up.	5521_5.q	110.0	1	1st Round	AEGON CLASSIC	International
5521_6	Yeah, no, we get along. Obviously we're on the Fed Cup team together, so yeah, it'll be fun. (Smiling.)	5521_6.a	2014-06-10	F	5521	Kurumi Nara	Johanna Konta	Are you guys friends?	5521_6.q	110.0	1	1st Round	AEGON CLASSIC	International
5521_7	To be honest, I didn't really think about it. We get the schedule; I see when I play; I don't necessarily look where I play. As long as I'm on a court, that's a good thing. So, yeah, no, I didn't feel that was really a factor.	5521_7.a	2014-06-10	F	5521	Kurumi Nara	Johanna Konta	I think it was a case that maybe your match could have been on center court today. Did you feel like that should have been the case?	5521_7.q	110.0	1	1st Round	AEGON CLASSIC	International
5521_8	Is that a player?	5521_8.a	2014-06-10	F	5521	Kurumi Nara	Johanna Konta	Can I ask you about Aljaz Bedene, the Slovenian...	5521_8.q	110.0	1	1st Round	AEGON CLASSIC	International
5521_9	Well, obviously my route of becoming British was a very long one. I've been in the country almost ten years now. Not sure of his story, but obviously he feels strongly for being here and to represent Great Britain. I know that Great Britain is my home. This is where I grew up, so of course I would welcome him with open arms, and I hope the Davis Cup team do as well. I'm sure he'll do us proud.	5521_9.a	2014-06-10	F	5521	Kurumi Nara	Johanna Konta	Yeah, Slovenian chap that taking British nationality. Your thoughts about that? He's going down not entirely the same road, but similar to you. Do you think it's good? We should welcome him onto the Davis Cup team?	5521_9.q	110.0	1	1st Round	AEGON CLASSIC	International
5521_10	Is it? It's only been me, and now Aljaz. I'm not you be who else has obviously Laura has an Australian passport as well. I didn't really think much. But, I mean, you see players moving to different countries and growing up in different areas. Navratilova, didn't she convert to United States citizenship? So it's not an uncommon thing to do. I think wherever a player feels that that's home for them and where they feel most connected to, whatever country that is, they should be able to represent that country.	5521_10.a	2014-06-10	F	5521	Kurumi Nara	Johanna Konta	Why is Britain so attractive to guys that maybe want to come take British nationality?	5521_10.q	110.0	1	1st Round	AEGON CLASSIC	International
5521_11	The atmosphere has always been good here. There are a lot of children around, so a lot of very that kind of children clapping which is very exciting. So I think that you feel that energy through the whole tournament. Same as last year. This is my second year here. You, no, it's lots of people, so that always adds atmosphere.	5521_11.a	2014-06-10	F	5521	Kurumi Nara	Johanna Konta	It was a very big crowd. What was the atmosphere like?	5521_11.q	110.0	1	1st Round	AEGON CLASSIC	International
2626_0	I was not sure that I see it correctly. And if I would see it correctly, I would challenge it.	2626_0.a	2010-11-26	M	2626	Rafael Nadal	Tomas Berdych	Didn't look very happy with some calls overall in the first set, but you were not challenging. Why was that?	2626_0.q	6.0	0	Round Robin	BARCLAYS ATP WORLD TOUR FINALS	Masters Cup
2626_1	It was not the reason. It just show how the referee is probably scared of him and just let him to talk with him too long, you know. I mean, every game is very tough. Even if you get a chance to have a 30-15 up, you know, be on like the good move, you know, you needs to play. But not like waiting and talking for three minutes. The rules are quite correct, you know. When you ask for the challenge, and he stops the game. It's so simple that the point is what the challenge shows, and let's play and continue, not to be talking. Then, I don't know, he was almost like sitting there, he's not going to play, stuff like that. I mean, it's not the mistake of Rafa. It's the mistake of the referee. He just need to show him that it's not like he can do whatever he wants on the court, just let him play. It should be more, you know, continuous. It was just a normal call. So I don't know why he was take so long.	2626_1.a	2010-11-26	M	2626	Rafael Nadal	Tomas Berdych	How much did the Hawk-Eye calling the challenge, the resulting outburst at 5-6 affect your concentration? Was that the reason why you lost the tiebreak?	2626_1.q	6.0	0	Round Robin	BARCLAYS ATP WORLD TOUR FINALS	Masters Cup
2626_2	Of course, yeah, I'm disappointing. I want to win. You know, I want to won the first set, and maybe we still would be on the court, whatever. It doesn't happen. Yeah, I lost the match against Rafa. I can't be really happy after that.	2626_2.a	2010-11-26	M	2626	Rafael Nadal	Tomas Berdych	Were you disappointed with your play in the tiebreak in the first set?	2626_2.q	6.0	0	Round Robin	BARCLAYS ATP WORLD TOUR FINALS	Masters Cup
2626_3	Well, I mean, I just step out from the last match of this season, and you already asking me for the goals for next year. I mean, the goal for right now, it's definitely to take rest because I'm going almost two seasons in a row, because we played the Davis Cup final last year. I really like to have some days off and not to be thinking anymore about the tennis. And then we can be talking about some goals for the next season.	2626_3.a	2010-11-26	M	2626	Rafael Nadal	Tomas Berdych	You had a very good year this year. You reached your first Grand Slam final. But still when someone watches you, it seems you still have a lot of room to improve. What are your goals as this season closes for next year? What are you going to work on in the meantime?	2626_3.q	6.0	0	Round Robin	BARCLAYS ATP WORLD TOUR FINALS	Masters Cup
2626_4	Well, of course, there are possibilities. But, as I said, right now I'm just finished the season, and that's it. I'll be thinking about the possibilities and what I need to improve just after that time when I'm going to be like mentally ready again to start preparation for the next season. That's going to be it. It's still going to take few time.	2626_4.a	2010-11-26	M	2626	Rafael Nadal	Tomas Berdych	What do you want to improve in your game? Where do you see the possibilities to improve?	2626_4.q	6.0	0	Round Robin	BARCLAYS ATP WORLD TOUR FINALS	Masters Cup
2626_5	No, don't be asking me about more tennis which is going to come. Just the best team is going to win. That's all I can say.	2626_5.a	2010-11-26	M	2626	Rafael Nadal	Tomas Berdych	You played France last year in Davis Cup. You played Serbia this year. Which team is a better one? You just played in Belgrade.	2626_5.q	6.0	0	Round Robin	BARCLAYS ATP WORLD TOUR FINALS	Masters Cup
2626_6	No, I mean, it's pretty simple. He was able to play. But every time when you just raise your hand, that means that you stop the play. That's the reason why I was just challenging the ball, because he stopped the play, and that's it. So he stopped the play and said the ball was out. The referee just changed the call from the linesman, say that the ball was out, so the game, it was stopped. I take the challenge. The challenge was good, so the ball was good. There is no any like complaining about this point. If you just raise the hands and you stop the game, it's the same if you play on clay. If you hit the ball close to the line, you just raise your hand, stop the play, doesn't matter which call it is. Referee coming down, checking the mark. If the mark is good, you lose the point. That's how it is with the challenge. So there was no complaining at all about this point.	2626_6.a	2010-11-26	M	2626	Rafael Nadal	Tomas Berdych	After what you said before about Nadal, that ball, can you explain exactly what happened. I had the impression that Nadal was saying he could still play the point. That's why he thought he needed to have a replay of the point. You wanted the point. What happened exactly?	2626_6.q	6.0	0	Round Robin	BARCLAYS ATP WORLD TOUR FINALS	Masters Cup
2626_7	Oh, yeah, well, I mean, the experience, it gives me really a lot of new experience. I mean, especially the first match was really different. As I said, starting the tournament against such a tough opponent like Novak is, that is really something new and it's something different. The first game was not so good. But then in the next one I find my rhythm, starts to play pretty well, won the second match. Yeah, well, I mean, with Rafa, it's just about that you go on court, you trying your best, and then you just gonna see what's gonna happen, if he's gonna be in good shape, or he's going to do some more mistakes or not. But I think I had a pretty good two matches. The first one was just a new experience. So, yeah, I mean, it was really nice to be here, finishing the year here.	2626_7.a	2010-11-26	M	2626	Rafael Nadal	Tomas Berdych	How do you reflect on your experiences of this tournament overall?	2626_7.q	6.0	0	Round Robin	BARCLAYS ATP WORLD TOUR FINALS	Masters Cup
2626_8	Probably I was voting for -- no, actually I was voting for Rafa because I was just, you know, trying to just decide I think between two names, him and Roger. Yeah, I mean, I just decide to go for Rafa. I think he really deserves it, you know. Just was a little bit disappointing after what I read in London, you know, when I play against Roger and beat him. He was a little bit complaining about how he was injured and stuff like that. It was just kind of surprise for me. So maybe that was just the reason I vote for Rafa. So I think he deserves it. Why not?	2626_8.a	2010-11-26	M	2626	Rafael Nadal	Tomas Berdych	Players gave recently the fair play sportsmanship award to Rafael Nadal. What is your opinion about it? Were you one of those that voted for him or not?	2626_8.q	6.0	0	Round Robin	BARCLAYS ATP WORLD TOUR FINALS	Masters Cup
2626_9	I mean, he didn't do anything wrong. I mean, don't do anything that I said something wrong against Rafa. It was just one call in the game. Nothing happened. Of course, he deserves it.	2626_9.a	2010-11-26	M	2626	Rafael Nadal	Tomas Berdych	Even after today, you still think that way?	2626_9.q	6.0	0	Round Robin	BARCLAYS ATP WORLD TOUR FINALS	Masters Cup
2626_10	Yeah, every time you play No.1 player in the world, I mean, is a great experience. Even here, it was a nice match. Yeah, I mean, it could go different. I mean, maybe two, three points in the first set, maybe we would still be on the court and playing. But just doesn't happen. You know, he is the best player in the world. I mean, it's not gonna happen that you beat him every second time that you're going to play him. I needs to still, you know, improve. I needs to learn from those mistakes. That's the way how I can be better for the future. And even to get here, it was one of my goals for this year, and I'm happy for that.	2626_10.a	2010-11-26	M	2626	Rafael Nadal	Tomas Berdych	One of the highlights of the season was getting to a Wimbledon final. What was it like playing Rafa again today?	2626_10.q	6.0	0	Round Robin	BARCLAYS ATP WORLD TOUR FINALS	Masters Cup
6015_0	Yeah, I thought the first set was very competitive. She started really well, and I managed to get back into the set and break her back. I played some really good tennis towards the end of that first set and then in the second. It was really unfortunate she didn't feel good in the second.	6015_0.a	2014-02-11	F	6015	Daniela Hantuchova	Ana Ivanovic	Well, it was an abbreviated evening. Talk about how you felt you were playing for as much as you got to play.	6015_0.q	12.0	1	1st Round	QATAR TOTAL OPEN	Premier
6015_1	I think it's not fair in a way. You know, this is a big event. A lot of players have been forced to arrive even today or last night. It's very hard for some players. But, you know, I think it's a choice they have to make, although I know how hard it is with the pressure they feel from their own countries. But I spoke to some of the players, and they had their own frustrations. It's very hard decision to make. It's a very, very hard one. You know, everyone is in different place in their careers, and they can sort of decide that.	6015_1.a	2014-02-11	F	6015	Daniela Hantuchova	Ana Ivanovic	Like you said, most of the players came from Fed Cup, and this is a tournament that's fairly off the beaten path, you know, not next door. How tough is that commute and stuff?	6015_1.q	12.0	1	1st Round	QATAR TOTAL OPEN	Premier
6015_2	Yeah, definitely coming here with more confidence than I had in the previous years. I really hope I can put that in place, you know, match after match and have a good week, you know, because I did not have great results here in the past. Hopefully that can change now.	6015_2.a	2014-02-11	F	6015	Daniela Hantuchova	Ana Ivanovic	Like you talked on the court, you're having a great start to the year. Are you feeling this momentum coming into this tournament? How do you feel?	6015_2.q	12.0	1	1st Round	QATAR TOTAL OPEN	Premier
6015_3	Yeah. I think confidence a lot of times from within but also from the people that you surround yourself with. Since I have a new team, I really feel they are very positive, they are very much behind me. You know, even the days when I'm doubting or struggling, you know, they are positive and they are supporting me, and that means a lot to me. When you have that positive affirmation and encouragement day in and day out, it does make a difference. I always felt I have a game and I can beat top players, but sometimes this confidence was lacking. You know, from this side they tell me a few things. Over the months and weeks that we spend together, I develop trust as well. It means a lot to me.	6015_3.a	2014-02-11	F	6015	Daniela Hantuchova	Ana Ivanovic	Talk a little bit more about that confidence. Is it in the coach, or are you feeling more settled in yourself or less nervous?	6015_3.q	12.0	1	1st Round	QATAR TOTAL OPEN	Premier
6015_4	Actually, I was very happy it wasn't windy tonight, but it was cold. It's slow, anyway, and obviously in the cold it is a little bit more slow, but, you know, I was here for a while so I had chance to adjust. But with my jet lag, I was always practicing in the morning, so this is actually the first time I played in the afternoon.	6015_4.a	2014-02-11	F	6015	Daniela Hantuchova	Ana Ivanovic	To go back to the match, was it hard to play with these weather conditions, like cold, the wind?	6015_4.q	12.0	1	1st Round	QATAR TOTAL OPEN	Premier
3257_0	Yeah, uhm, well, it was their decision. You know, it was tough to say. I played well in Sydney. So I can't really say much. It was their choice.	3257_0.a	2011-01-18	M	3257	Jeremy Chardy	Bernard Tomic	Were you a little worried about getting a wild card?	3257_0.q	199.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3257_1	Probably not, no. Today I served, you know, solid, but I served really good on the points that I needed to.	3257_1.a	2011-01-18	M	3257	Jeremy Chardy	Bernard Tomic	Good opponent today, a player with some success in the past. Have you ever served better on the important points than that in a match?	3257_1.q	199.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3257_2	Uhm, well, I've definitely been working on it, and I've also shot up, as well. You know, the taller you are, the better it is for the serve. I think I focused more on those important points than I did on the others.	3257_2.a	2011-01-18	M	3257	Jeremy Chardy	Bernard Tomic	The first serve that you sent out you were landing them on the big points quite well. Have you been working on it, or is it just more height?	3257_2.q	199.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3257_3	I don't know. I get lucky here somehow (laughter). No, I play down here really good. Amongst the crowd, it's different playing with your home crowd, the way they get behind you. I'm sure the other player feels it, as well. Uhm, you know, I take that to my advantage. The crowd here gets behind me and I play even better, I think.	3257_3.a	2011-01-18	M	3257	Jeremy Chardy	Bernard Tomic	What is it about playing here? You've hardly had a tour-level win, and yet you've had three here. What is it about the Australian Open that brings out your best?	3257_3.q	199.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3257_4	I've been working on sort of making the transition of the ball, to hit it harder throughout the point. Sometimes I get in the rally where I play too soft. Against these guys, you need to take the first point and hit it hard. That's what I've been doing and working on the last six months. So really taking the opportunity whenever I get it.	3257_4.a	2011-01-18	M	3257	Jeremy Chardy	Bernard Tomic	What have you been working on in your game, given you didn't play a whole lot the second half of last year?	3257_4.q	199.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3257_5	My slice is my best shot. That's one that gets me out of trouble that I can hurt players, get it down low. They don't like it low. Today he didn't like it low. That's what I was using as a weapon.	3257_5.a	2011-01-18	M	3257	Jeremy Chardy	Bernard Tomic	Slice worked well today; seemed to sort of get him off his rhythm a little.	3257_5.q	199.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3257_6	Well, of course. I mean, before I used to, you know, push the ball. It was tough for me to come forward. Now that I'm taking the opportunity and hitting it harder, I've got more chance to which forward off the right ball.	3257_6.a	2011-01-18	M	3257	Jeremy Chardy	Bernard Tomic	You approached the net quite a bit early. Is that probably didn't see much of that last year? Is that also something you've been instructed to do?	3257_6.q	199.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3257_7	Yeah, uhm, well, you know, my job is just to play and worry about my game. If others can do well, other Australians, it's good, too. But there's nothing much I can do, just focus on my game.	3257_7.a	2011-01-18	M	3257	Jeremy Chardy	Bernard Tomic	Are you aware of the excitement you're causing? Australia hasn't been doing too well lately.	3257_7.q	199.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3257_8	Absolutely. I think, you know, once I build my athleticism, I'll be much better at, you know, controlling points. I think I control the points really good now at my age. But it's a matter of just, you know, like I've worked on the last six months, taking the short ball on the first chance. That will come if you're athletically fit. I think if my body is feeling fit and can run around the forehand or take that first chance and step in, I think it will develop.	3257_8.a	2011-01-18	M	3257	Jeremy Chardy	Bernard Tomic	All the shots that you have, do you think that the physical side of your game just needs to be stepped up a little bit? Is physically getting stronger going to be the most important? You're getting taller, but is the physical side the one thing you need to work on a little bit more?	3257_8.q	199.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3257_9	Court 21 (laughter).	3257_9.a	2011-01-18	M	3257	Jeremy Chardy	Bernard Tomic	Last year there was controversy. You won your first round. Played a late-night match in the second round. What are your preferences this time? Do you want to play in the day or night?	3257_9.q	199.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3257_10	I don't mind. Whatever they give me. It's up to them. I don't prefer playing on Laver, any of the other courts, Hisense or Margaret. Doesn't bother me.	3257_10.a	2011-01-18	M	3257	Jeremy Chardy	Bernard Tomic	Seriously? Do you want to be shielded, or would you rather the spotlight there?	3257_10.q	199.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3257_11	These courts are pretty slow. What I found on Laver and Hisense, they're pretty slow. Even during the day, they're pretty slow. I think they're the slowest hard courts around. I don't reckon it makes any difference for me if I play at night or day.	3257_11.a	2011-01-18	M	3257	Jeremy Chardy	Bernard Tomic	Some players prefer playing at night because it's a bit slower; others during the day because it's quicker.	3257_11.q	199.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3257_12	Well, look, it's tough to say that. I mean, I think I played well as a junior. That's totally different to the senior level. But, uhm, you know, I think I'm stepping up and beating all these players now. I think it's just a matter of time before I win a lot of matches in a row in a tournament.	3257_12.a	2011-01-18	M	3257	Jeremy Chardy	Bernard Tomic	Are you sometimes surprised at the publicity you get considering you haven't won a whole lot of matches in your career yet?	3257_12.q	199.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3257_13	I'd love to. Depends. I've got a tough next round against Lpez. He can play really good and just blow you off the court. I think if I prepare and play well like I did today, I think I've got a good chance.	3257_13.a	2011-01-18	M	3257	Jeremy Chardy	Bernard Tomic	This one maybe?	3257_13.q	199.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3257_14	I did last year (laughter). No, I haven't really. No, I haven't.	3257_14.a	2011-01-18	M	3257	Jeremy Chardy	Bernard Tomic	Do you read the newspapers?	3257_14.q	199.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3257_15	Yeah, absolutely. I mean, the faster it is for him the better. The slower, the better for me.	3257_15.a	2011-01-18	M	3257	Jeremy Chardy	Bernard Tomic	Do you think the pace of the court might be to your benefit against someone like Lpez? Take the sting off his serve a little bit and give you a chance to get into the rallies.	3257_15.q	199.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3257_16	It's going to be a new year. I think I'm going to play a lot more tournaments. I think I want to break the top hundred. I think it's tough. But if I play more tournaments this year, I've got a good shot. But saying that, you can get sick. There's a lot of things going around. If I play, play the way I'm playing the last few weeks, I think my progress will show.	3257_16.a	2011-01-18	M	3257	Jeremy Chardy	Bernard Tomic	Do you have targets in terms of your development? You're saying you're still young and developing your body. Do you have things you want to achieve by certain ages or times in 2011?	3257_16.q	199.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3257_17	"Yeah, I'm getting close to 6'5"". I think I've stopped growing. It's just, you know, I'm physically getting wider. Growing is a tough thing. Don't get me wrong. You can play well sometimes, and then you come to the court sometimes in practice and I can't find my ball. But sometimes, you know, I think when I'm settled and I'm not growing as much, I play better."	3257_17.a	2011-01-18	M	3257	Jeremy Chardy	Bernard Tomic	Are you still growing? How tall are you right now?	3257_17.q	199.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3257_18	Yeah, I used to weigh 86 kilos last Oz Open; now I'm weighing 91. I've definitely got more on me. I'm not saying I'm going to be like a hundred kilos. That's not ideal for a tennis player. But I think this is my limit now with my weight. I just have to use this weight, where I am now, and just hold it.	3257_18.a	2011-01-18	M	3257	Jeremy Chardy	Bernard Tomic	You said you're getting wider. Have you put on much weight?	3257_18.q	199.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3257_19	I think so. It's tough, especially now in the last three years, for such a young player to come in the top hundred. There's a lot of players now that are so physically strong that tennis is becoming so hard. It's just going to continue to get harder. If you're not physically fit and strong, you got no chance, I think.	3257_19.a	2011-01-18	M	3257	Jeremy Chardy	Bernard Tomic	There are no teenagers as of now in the top 100. You mentioned the physical aspect of the game. Do you think that's the main reason, because the game is so physical?	3257_19.q	199.0	1	1st Round	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3320_0	Yeah, absolutely. You know, I think the worst one was against Ana, definitely, because I really didn't have any food in my body before the match, and it was really hard to hang on against her, not only the pace of the match and the long rallies, but also, you know, feeling physically very weak. Today was better, but still definitely not 100%. So I was kind of having these -- not a collapse, but my level drop after the first set because, you know, still not able to fully eat normally before the match, so I didn't have many fuel into my body to hang on. But I stayed mentally very focused and I stayed positive toward the end. I knew if I was not playing not 100%, but a good level, I will still be able to come out on top.	3320_0.a	2011-03-18	F	3320	Yanina Wickmayer	Marion Bartoli	That was a good win. How is your stomach issue today? You weren't feeling too good in the previous round.	3320_0.q	17.0	1	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
3320_1	Well, any way it will be a very hard challenge either way, if it's Maria or Caroline. I lost against Caroline I think few weeks ago in Doha very easily. She played some really great tennis since the beginning of the year. She's No.1 in the world. She's very confident. Maria is one of the toughest competitors of woman's game. So either way it will be a very hard challenge; either way, I will be the underdog going into the final, and I will have absolutely nothing to lose. So it's gonna be first of all a huge challenge, but also a great experience for me to be out there and show how good I can play. So really, the thing I'm gonna focus on is really going on court and try to play the best tennis as I can.	3320_1.a	2011-03-18	F	3320	Yanina Wickmayer	Marion Bartoli	I suppose you'll be watching the game tonight. Which one of the two opponents would you rather see in the final, and why?	3320_1.q	17.0	1	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
3320_2	Well, yeah, of course. Both of it. I'm very excited to be in the final, but also, I knew I could be there. It was just a matter of time between the Wimbledon final and getting to the final over here. Obviously I had everything in my game to be there, but it was just a matter of putting everything together at the good time and being tough on the court. And, of course, knowing I could be there like I did in the final of Wimbledon helped me mentally to really stay positive, even when I had some bad results, to really stay focus and know I can be there one day or the other. So it's great for me to showing up during this week in Indian Wells, and hopefully I will be able to keep this level towards the end of the season.	3320_2.a	2011-03-18	F	3320	Yanina Wickmayer	Marion Bartoli	You've been on tour for a few years. You've been a Wimbledon finalist. Does a result like this excite you? Does it thrill you? What kind of emotions do you feel?	3320_2.q	17.0	1	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
3320_3	Well, yeah, the thing against Caroline, she's so consistent. It's hard to really pass her, as you say. We had some really long games, deuce, advantage, deuce, advantage, but she was always winning them. So this scoreline was very tough. She beat me 6-1, 6-1. But the games, some of them were really close, and if I was able to win them, maybe the score would be different. But she's not No.1 in the world for nothing, so she's really not giving you much. You have really to earn every single points. The key was my serve. I really serve almost poorly, you know, not very good at all. My first percentage of first serve was very low, and every single second serve I was serving she was really putting me on the run every single time. So I think the key will be, if I play against her on Sunday, to really have a high percent of first serves. When I beat her in Cincinnati I was able to really serve really well. That will be definitely the key when -- if I'm playing against Maria.	3320_3.a	2011-03-18	F	3320	Yanina Wickmayer	Marion Bartoli	What happened against Caroline a couple weeks ago? That isn't a normal type of defeat for you. You only won a couple of games. You couldn't find a way to put the ball past her.	3320_3.q	17.0	1	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
3320_4	Um, well, the first set I start to serve extremely well. I was really acing her a lot. Yanina is really returning well, so to be able to ace her so many times means really I was serving well. And then, of course, the second set my first serve dropped, but I was able to stay very consistent in the rallies, you know, and not giving her too many free points. I was able to come up with some great passing shots and some great lobs. I think the most satisfying part was I was able to, even when my first serve dropped, stay really focused and not showing too many bad emotions onto the court and really stay positive towards the end.	3320_4.a	2011-03-18	F	3320	Yanina Wickmayer	Marion Bartoli	What was the most satisfying area of your game today, even though you weren't feeling at your best?	3320_4.q	17.0	1	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
3320_5	Ah, well, I never beat Maria in the past. Maybe when she was 12 years old and we played under-16 in the Orange Bowl. (Laughter.) I think that was the only time I won, so I don't even think that is counting anymore. But, you know, either way I would have nothing to lose, even if it's Caroline or Maria. So I will really go onto the courts knowing I have nothing to lose and really try to play my best tennis. When I play against Maria in our past contests I never was able to play my best tennis. That's really the maybe thing I'm going to focus on, is to play my best and see if I am very far from winning or not.	3320_5.a	2011-03-18	F	3320	Yanina Wickmayer	Marion Bartoli	If you happen to be playing Sharapova, what are your thoughts on that one?	3320_5.q	17.0	1	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
3320_6	Uh-huh.	3320_6.a	2011-03-18	F	3320	Yanina Wickmayer	Marion Bartoli	You told the French press or in French yesterday that you have a 175 IQ.	3320_6.q	17.0	1	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
3320_7	I know. Yeah, I hope to be that good in tennis one day.	3320_7.a	2011-03-18	F	3320	Yanina Wickmayer	Marion Bartoli	That's very high.	3320_7.q	17.0	1	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
3320_8	Well, I did a test when I was younger, but I'm not really someone that is really telling everyone, Oh, I'm so smart and whatever. (Smiling.) I'm kind of hiding it or try to be not very -- with a huge head like. But that's how I am, you know. It just comes naturally. That's how I was born with.	3320_8.a	2011-03-18	F	3320	Yanina Wickmayer	Marion Bartoli	How do you know that?	3320_8.q	17.0	1	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
3320_9	I know. You're going to tell me that was not a smart decision (Laughter.)	3320_9.a	2011-03-18	F	3320	Yanina Wickmayer	Marion Bartoli	So for someone with 175 IQ, choosing tennis over math or painting.	3320_9.q	17.0	1	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
3320_10	I know. But, you know what makes me -- when I was really younger and watching the TV and saw Pete Sampras and lifting his trophy year after year at Wimbledon. Even if I was good at school, that was really what was exciting me, this kind of challenge, being on center court of Wimbledon lifting this Wimbledon trophy. That was really the excitement. It was not coming up with 20 out of 20 on math. I mean, even if it was great, that was not what was exciting me. Even when I was 6 or 7 years old, what was exciting me when I was waking up every morning, it was what I was doing after school: playing tennis against a wall or whatever. My dad was very busy, you know, with my brother or with his job, and he couldn't practicing with me. I was just hitting over the wall for hours and hours and hours. The first thing I was thinking in the morning was tennis, and that was my passion. That still remains my passion. So even if I was not that good at it, I would still persevere to be where I am.	3320_10.a	2011-03-18	F	3320	Yanina Wickmayer	Marion Bartoli	With the amount of money you've made, I would not say that. But it's different, though.	3320_10.q	17.0	1	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
3320_11	Yes.	3320_11.a	2011-03-18	F	3320	Yanina Wickmayer	Marion Bartoli	You're very mathematical, correct?	3320_11.q	17.0	1	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
3320_12	I do. I truly believe that it helps me. You know, I'm always thinking on the court, always, always, always. I'm thinking, Well, when I was serving the last point, either if she, my opponent, make a winner or make a mistake or where is my percentage level first serve, whatever. I'm always thinking on the court, and I think that helps me.	3320_12.a	2011-03-18	F	3320	Yanina Wickmayer	Marion Bartoli	So do you bring that in tennis? Do you see tennis mathematically on the court?	3320_12.q	17.0	1	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
3320_13	I know. But when I'm starting not to think, it's not very good for me. When I'm thinking and I'm looking at the court and knowing where I'm gonna put the ball, that's where I usually I play my best.	3320_13.a	2011-03-18	F	3320	Yanina Wickmayer	Marion Bartoli	But thinking a lot also can be detrimental on the court.	3320_13.q	17.0	1	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
3320_14	Yes, I do.	3320_14.a	2011-03-18	F	3320	Yanina Wickmayer	Marion Bartoli	But you also have your artistic side, right? You're a painter?	3320_14.q	17.0	1	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
3320_15	Yes, I like to -- that's true. I like to be an artist. I like to think also very mathematically, very straight. That's both side of...	3320_15.a	2011-03-18	F	3320	Yanina Wickmayer	Marion Bartoli	You do everything. You have the math side. You're into both sides of the brain.	3320_15.q	17.0	1	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
3320_16	No, mathematician. When I'm on the court, it's just very thinking, you know. Really sometimes my dad say, Marion, you're just too much a mathematician. Give it a go, you know. Try it sometimes just to, you know, make it more -- not about mathematics. But I say, No, dad, it very mathematic. It has to be this way.	3320_16.a	2011-03-18	F	3320	Yanina Wickmayer	Marion Bartoli	Are you more of a mathematician or more of an artist on the court?	3320_16.q	17.0	1	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
3320_17	Yes. My father, the only sport he plays is chess. He doesn't like to run too much, that's for sure.	3320_17.a	2011-03-18	F	3320	Yanina Wickmayer	Marion Bartoli	This is your father who is a chess player speaking?	3320_17.q	17.0	1	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
3320_18	No, I don't like the abstract.	3320_18.a	2011-03-18	F	3320	Yanina Wickmayer	Marion Bartoli	As an artist, what trend do you prefer? More on the abstract or...	3320_18.q	17.0	1	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
3320_19	No, I don't like the abstract at all. More the impressionists. My favorite painter is Van Gogh. I truly love Van Gogh. I was very lucky to go to one of his exhibitions in Basel, in Switzerland.	3320_19.a	2011-03-18	F	3320	Yanina Wickmayer	Marion Bartoli	Impressionists?	3320_19.q	17.0	1	Semifinals	BNP PARIBAS OPEN	Premier
422_0	Victory is always important. Of course my level today was not the most desired. These matches are difficult. They are tough. You just got to overcome difficult moments and situations like the ones we had today. I think these are the matches that maybe give you the extra confidence that you need. They sometimes change everything. I like to play well and have fun on the court. Today on the court I didn't have a lot of fun because of conditions. It was a little bit windy. The court didn't have sand because the wind was taking it all. It was difficult to run. I managed to finish the match, and on Wednesday I will have another opportunity.	422_0.a	2015-05-04	M	422	Benjamin Becker	Feliciano Lopez	I wanted to know if you're satisfied with today's match? You came back in the third set. Did you feel like you should have closed it out in two sets?	422_0.q	12.0	1	1st Round	MUTUA MADRID OPEN	Masters 1000
422_1	Well, I think that sincerely my behavior was not the correct one for a tennis player. I think that I committed errors. I said the Big F many times. The first warning I didn't realize that he gave me a warning, and that's why I was so surprised when he told me I had to go to the other side and I had a point penalty. Really the first warning, I didn't hear that. Carlos, I respect him a lot. I think he's a really good chair umpire, one the best ones. He knows that. We talked about that many times. Secondly, there are players like me, which normally have decent behavior. We are not disrespectable players or we don't throw the racquet and we don't say the Big F. Except for today. Today I recognized that I was very nervous. I wanted to say to Carlos that the rules should be the same for every single player. I'm really tired of seeing players that behave really badly on the court and nothing happens. Perhaps there are players like me or anyone else that we might have a bad day and they punish us. The rules are for everyone. It cannot be that there are players we're not going to give names  they behave badly and nothing happens. That's what I don't like. It's a general thought. The chair ump has to enforce the rules, and if you have to expel a player from the court, then they have to do it. With us, players that normally have good behavior, like Rafa with the time. It's true he's slow sometimes, but the rules are there for everyone. Time and conduct, everything. Today I said, Carlos, I recognize my behavior was not the best today, but I want to have the same rule for every player. There are players that don't behave properly and nothing happens. He said, You're right. The rules are the same for everyone and I try to judge everyone the same way. That's what happened. That's all.	422_1.a	2015-05-04	M	422	Benjamin Becker	Feliciano Lopez	I would like to know your version of what happened with Carlos? Can you elaborate?	422_1.q	12.0	1	1st Round	MUTUA MADRID OPEN	Masters 1000
422_2	I think the ATP is working on that. I know that tennis is a sport that you have to behave yourself. You don't have to lose your temper. There are some codes. You have to behave yourself. That's all. There are a lot of rules. The only thing I'm saying is that the rules should be the same for everybody. What I was saying before, you know, if a player is really slow, you have to apply the rule of the time. And if a player smacks the other player's shoulder on the changeover, what happens? Nothing happens. We look somewhere else and that's all. Or a player with point penalty throws the ball out of stadium and the chair umpire acts like he hasn't seen it. I think that these are not normal and they should be pointed out. Rules should be the same for everybody. That's all I'm saying.	422_2.a	2015-05-04	M	422	Benjamin Becker	Feliciano Lopez	You say that the rules should be the same for everybody. Is that a vision that many players have? Have you talked about that with the ATP?	422_2.q	12.0	1	1st Round	MUTUA MADRID OPEN	Masters 1000
422_3	Here in Madrid I'm used to playing because I train here, I live here. I think the altitude in Madrid is not a big deal. It's true that you can feel it, especially today. Perhaps you can feel it today more because of the conditions of the day. It was a little bit hard to play. But nothing to do with those places where it's nearly a miracle to get the ball inside the court, inside the lines.	422_3.a	2015-05-04	M	422	Benjamin Becker	Feliciano Lopez	I know you were in Quito in attitude and it was a really great tournament. And now here in Madrid. How did you adapt to altitude in two days?	422_3.q	12.0	1	1st Round	MUTUA MADRID OPEN	Masters 1000
5029_0	Yeah, I think in general it was a frustrating match. It was just annoying for me, because I feel like I have been practicing a little bit better this week, and to come out on court and just feel very, very defensive the majority of the match is really disappointing.	5029_0.a	2013-02-18	F	5029	nan	Laura Robson	Must be very frustrating after the way you fought back in that third set.	5029_0.q	43.0	0	1st Round	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS WOMEN	Premier
5029_1	I wouldn't say those spells are magical, really. I just managed to get a few more balls in. You know, unfortunately it just wasn't my day. I just either went for too much or too little, and I just couldn't find the right balance.	5029_1.a	2013-02-18	F	5029	nan	Laura Robson	You had some wonderful spells in the second set, and toward the end of that third set it looked like you'd run away with it. How difficult is it to maintain that form to the finish?	5029_1.q	43.0	0	1st Round	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS WOMEN	Premier
5029_2	I have had a chest infection since the start of the year, and so I have been on about four courses of antibiotics and nothing's gotten rid of it. It's just something that I'm living with.	5029_2.a	2013-02-18	F	5029	nan	Laura Robson	You're not very well? You're coughing and you sound a bit...	5029_2.q	43.0	0	1st Round	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS WOMEN	Premier
5029_3	Well, she gets a lot of balls back. When she has time on her forehand, she can really do a lot with the ball. So she's always tough to play. You know, the last time I played her was Australian Open Juniors about two or three years ago, and, yeah, we have had some interesting matches before. This is another interesting one.	5029_3.a	2013-02-18	F	5029	nan	Laura Robson	How difficult an opponent was she?	5029_3.q	43.0	0	1st Round	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS WOMEN	Premier
5029_4	I'll analyze it. I analyze all my matches. You have to try and learn as much as you can from one of them, even though some of them can be really bad. You just have to learn from them and work a bit harder.	5029_4.a	2013-02-18	F	5029	nan	Laura Robson	Will you analyze it, or will you just try and forget it as quickly as possible?	5029_4.q	43.0	0	1st Round	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS WOMEN	Premier
5029_5	Honestly, I just want to keep practicing no matter where it is and start finding my timing a bit better.	5029_5.a	2013-02-18	F	5029	nan	Laura Robson	Will you be looking forward to some time at home now?	5029_5.q	43.0	0	1st Round	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS WOMEN	Premier
5029_6	I'm seeing a specialist when I get home, and we will make another decision then.	5029_6.a	2013-02-18	F	5029	nan	Laura Robson	With the chest infection, do you think you need to take just a few days off?	5029_6.q	43.0	0	1st Round	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS WOMEN	Premier
5029_7	Oh, yeah. It was on and off since the Olympics last year, and so now it's just worse. But it's fine.	5029_7.a	2013-02-18	F	5029	nan	Laura Robson	So the chest infection was there all the way through the Fed Cup?	5029_7.q	43.0	0	1st Round	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS WOMEN	Premier
5029_8	I can see you guys trying to make this into something, and I really don't want to go there.	5029_8.a	2013-02-18	F	5029	nan	Laura Robson	How does it affect you on court? Do you have trouble breathing at all?	5029_8.q	43.0	0	1st Round	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS WOMEN	Premier
5029_9	Yeah, for sure. All the facilities are really, really great, and it's so nice being virtually onsite with the hotel. I have really enjoyed it here and definitely going to come back.	5029_9.a	2013-02-18	F	5029	nan	Laura Robson	Just a word on Dubai. Obviously you had the problems with the luggage as well, and obviously you haven't played this tournament as much as you'd really like. Is it a tournament you've liked and you'd like to come back next year?	5029_9.q	43.0	0	1st Round	DUBAI DUTY FREE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS WOMEN	Premier
4532_0	Yeah, I mean, it's always disappointing to lose I think when you play a good match like that, you know, and you think you've done enough almost to win. So, you know, on that front it's disappointing. Still, I think I have had three really good matches here. Again, kind of proved to myself by getting through that first round from that deficit in the third really did to try and help and get confidence and gain a bit of momentum going into New York. Coming back in that third set, I have now won another match and played another really good match today. There are still some positives to take from it.	4532_0.a	2012-08-17	F	4532	Venus Williams	Samantha Stosur	Tough match today, obviously. How much do you take out of this with respect to your preparation for the Open?	4532_0.q	6.0	0	Quarterfinals	WESTERN & SOUTHERN OPEN	Premier
4532_1	Yeah, I think so. I think you always feel when you're playing well or when it is a good match, then, you know, you can tell that people are into it and it's exciting and all that. For sure, those matches are a lot more enjoyable than certain other ones. You do feel that when you're out there.	4532_1.a	2012-08-17	F	4532	Venus Williams	Samantha Stosur	As you said, disappointing, but it was such a high quality match. Can you allow yourself to enjoy a match like that while that's happening?	4532_1.q	6.0	0	Quarterfinals	WESTERN & SOUTHERN OPEN	Premier
4532_2	Yeah, I mean, she's doing pretty well. I mean, obviously she's the only one who can tell you how she feels week in and week out. Match in Charleston we played was kind of like today. It was a really good match and a pretty long threesetter. The one in Rome I think both of us actually played pretty average. That was probably not a good indication. Today, here again, it's another good one. I think, you know, overall it's always gonna be kind of on her racquet how she's gonna feel and how she's gonna come out and play. You know, I think if certain things are working for her then it makes it easier for her to be out there and doing well in tournaments.	4532_2.a	2012-08-17	F	4532	Venus Williams	Samantha Stosur	You have played Venus three times from the beginning of kind of her comeback to a little bit in the middle and now. How have you seen her game kind of progress since she's come back?	4532_2.q	6.0	0	Quarterfinals	WESTERN & SOUTHERN OPEN	Premier
4532_3	Yeah, first set wasn't too bad but just kinda probably didn't do enough. You know, we both had the same amount of break points, and she broke me three times and I got her once. I think kind of showed that she was maybe a little more aggressive and maybe took those opportunities more than what I did. Throughout that second set, just kind of loosened up and started hitting the ball well and moving well. I think I served better throughout the rest of the match from the second and the third, as well. Yeah, not too much in it. I think sometimes I lost serve by not doing that much wrong. If that happens, then you have to say, Okay, now I try and return and break you. It's a much better feeling when you lose a match or lose serve, you know, still doing the right things.	4532_3.a	2012-08-17	F	4532	Venus Williams	Samantha Stosur	Could you assess your play today, especially from the first set to the second?	4532_3.q	6.0	0	Quarterfinals	WESTERN & SOUTHERN OPEN	Premier
4532_4	Yeah, she kind of I think went up and down with how much pace she was wanting to put on it. You know, I don't know what the win percentage was, but I'm guessing it was pretty decent. I guess if you're getting rewarded on that front then you kind of keep going for it. Even when she served at 52 she went for big bombs and I managed to make those and then break. She did the same thing the next game and got rewarded for it. Again, it kind of proves you stick with something you know you're good at. You believe it's going to work for you. That's what she did kind of as the third set went on.	4532_4.a	2012-08-17	F	4532	Venus Williams	Samantha Stosur	For most of the match Venus' firstserve percentage was in the mid 40s. Do you think that she was going for maybe a little bit more against you? What was it like being on the receiving end of her serve?	4532_4.q	6.0	0	Quarterfinals	WESTERN & SOUTHERN OPEN	Premier
4532_5	Yeah.	4532_5.a	2012-08-17	F	4532	Venus Williams	Samantha Stosur	Next up for you is New York.	4532_5.q	6.0	0	Quarterfinals	WESTERN & SOUTHERN OPEN	Premier
4532_6	I'm going to go back to Florida for a few days and then head up to New York on Wednesday. You know, I will take a day off tomorrow, travel there, try and get some good practice in, and just do the same in New York once I arrive there.	4532_6.a	2012-08-17	F	4532	Venus Williams	Samantha Stosur	What are you going to do for the next I guess little over a week that you have until the tournament starts?	4532_6.q	6.0	0	Quarterfinals	WESTERN & SOUTHERN OPEN	Premier
4532_7	Well, you know, it is what it is. I'm looking forward to going back there. It's a good feeling to be going into the tournament now I think with a little bit more confidence, which is good. Yeah, I think it will be a little bit different, but again, it's something to look forward to.	4532_7.a	2012-08-17	F	4532	Venus Williams	Samantha Stosur	Are you expecting it to be any different now that you don't have anything else besides being the defending champion in New York?	4532_7.q	6.0	0	Quarterfinals	WESTERN & SOUTHERN OPEN	Premier
4358_0	Yeah, well, I'm trying to enjoy the efficiency of my serve. I'm not very wellknown around the tour for big serving. But so far in this tournament, and also in Beijing, it has been working very well for me. It has been giving me a lot of free points, a lot of confidence into the matches. This is a bit faster surface compared to the one I played last week, maybe compared to the majority of the hard court tournaments we're playing. So serve, advantage of having good serve, precise serves, is really very much needed in these circumstances.	4358_0.a	2012-10-11	M	4358	Feliciano Lopez	Novak Djokovic	You've heard this one before, but it seems like the serve is still working very well. 12 aces I think today.	4358_0.q	2.0	1	3rd Round	SHANGHAI ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
4358_1	Reflecting on 2012 in specific, I think it's fair to say it has been quite an evenly balanced year between the four, if you want to call it. But it hasn't been over. There's still a few more big events to come. Still there are things up for grabs, like No.1 place in the world. It's something that gives me a lot of motivation with Roger also. On the other hand, we haven't had four Grand Slam winners in how many years? So this is a great opportunity for the people to see a new Grand Slam winner, to get more attention to our sport. From that perspective it's really good.	4358_1.a	2012-10-11	M	4358	Feliciano Lopez	Novak Djokovic	Time and time again people have been saying 'greatest era'. Is it a fair reflection of how things actually stand between the four of you in that each of you has won a major this year?	4358_1.q	2.0	1	3rd Round	SHANGHAI ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
4358_2	Yeah.	4358_2.a	2012-10-11	M	4358	Feliciano Lopez	Novak Djokovic	Last year, this time of the year, you struggled after the US Open. You were physically struggling a bit.	4358_2.q	2.0	1	3rd Round	SHANGHAI ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
4358_3	Well, the scheduling more or less was similar in these two seasons. I haven't changed my routines that I've been respecting in practices, preparation and recovery programs. It all has been the same. But I've made maybe a couple of more wiser decisions on how to play, what to play, what to do in order to stay fit. I've had very long and emotional 2011. Winning the US Open also brought me a lot of joy, but a lot of fatigue also. I went back to Serbia and played a Davis Cup match, which got my injury worse, then I had to be away for two months also. This year hasn't been the case. I haven't played a Davis Cup. Maybe that helped me to stay fit. But I'll be having Davis Cup matches in the next year hopefully. I'm really looking forward to play for my country once again. I'll try to keep the good scheduling as a priority.	4358_3.a	2012-10-11	M	4358	Feliciano Lopez	Novak Djokovic	What has been the difference this year? You're obviously playing well now. Is it because you're not carrying any injuries or have you paced yourself better through the year?	4358_3.q	2.0	1	3rd Round	SHANGHAI ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
4358_4	Well, Ivan Ivo Andric is one of the Nobel prize winners, one of the biggest Serbians we have. I'm not really sure if you know him. He's one of my favorite writers obviously. Right now, during the tournaments, I usually like to read some easy reads, easy books. Let's say fiction, like Hunger Games, that trilogy that I read. That's something that keeps me interested in a book but also doesn't require much mental involvement, if you want to call it. When I have a little bit more time and I have no matches, then something a little bit more psychological, I guess.	4358_4.a	2012-10-11	M	4358	Feliciano Lopez	Novak Djokovic	We talked about a Nobel prize winner the other day and you said you read a lot. What are you reading now and what is your favorite writer?	4358_4.q	2.0	1	3rd Round	SHANGHAI ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
4358_5	That's for sure. I have many, many presents already here in Shanghai in these couple days. Many different ones. I got some masks. Usually the presents that I get are the ones which are associated in some way with Chinese tradition. So that's something very nice that I can take home and keep as a nice memory. But my favorite ones are the albums that they make. It's incredible. I've been saying it, I'll say once again, I'm impressed with the talent they have for drawing things. I think China has a great future in art because they are really, really good at it.	4358_5.a	2012-10-11	M	4358	Feliciano Lopez	Novak Djokovic	In Beijing you told us Chinese fans are very good at presents. Any special ones you got this year? You need more suitcases to go back to Europe?	4358_5.q	2.0	1	3rd Round	SHANGHAI ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
4358_6	Well, it's very individual, this sport. It's unique. It requires a lot of I guess professionalism in every sense of that word. Somebody realizes what he needs to do earlier, somebody later. That's also subjective. I can't really say why it took him so long. He can answer that better. I know him for a very long time. I think because we are coming from the same country, because we know each other really well, I think we helped also each other to kind of grow into better players.	4358_6.a	2012-10-11	M	4358	Feliciano Lopez	Novak Djokovic	You might play Janko in the quarterfinals. I think you reached the top 10 when you were 19. He reached it when he was 27. Why do you think it took him longer to get to the top?	4358_6.q	2.0	1	3rd Round	SHANGHAI ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
4358_7	Well, it was. But sometimes you have to make certain priorities depending on the season that you plan. I won with my teammates the Davis Cup title in 2010. That gave all of us wings, strong confidence boost that we used in the period to come after that. But we also all rate that title as probably the best experience that you can have because it's a team competition. Team spirit is something we don't get to experience that often, having a national captain on your bench supporting you, having all your colleagues from the national team supporting you whether you lose or not behind the court all the time. It's a very special feeling and I love playing Davis Cup. It's just that the scheduling of the Davis Cup is not so convenient for players, especially the top ones who play a lot of matches.	4358_7.a	2012-10-11	M	4358	Feliciano Lopez	Novak Djokovic	Back to the Davis Cup situation. A lot of words have been written and spoken whether the top guys really rate Davis Cup. Nobody is more patriotic for their country than you in the top four. How hard was it for you to turn your back on the Davis Cup this year?	4358_7.q	2.0	1	3rd Round	SHANGHAI ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
4358_8	No, I never ignore it, especially when my teammates and friends are playing. I try to look at it on the TV whenever I can, follow it live always. This year we had the Davis Cup tie right after the Australian Open. It was very grueling for me physically, so I couldn't be there. Then after Miami again there was a long couple weeks for me, a long tournament there. Unfortunately, I had to miss that. We didn't make it through the semifinals. But look, you know, every year is a chance for us to try to get all the way.	4358_8.a	2012-10-11	M	4358	Feliciano Lopez	Novak Djokovic	What did you do this year when Serbia played in Davis Cup? Were you there? Did you watch it on TV, ignore it altogether?	4358_8.q	2.0	1	3rd Round	SHANGHAI ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
4358_9	We're in touch. They're the players I spend the most time with on the tour. They're from my country. I know them the longest. We always speak about that. We share the same opinion: when we are together, we can bring the biggest success to our country. We hope we can all work our schedules for next season and seasons to come so we can play as much together as possible.	4358_9.a	2012-10-11	M	4358	Feliciano Lopez	Novak Djokovic	You talk to Janko and Troicki and Zimonjic?	4358_9.q	2.0	1	3rd Round	SHANGHAI ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
4358_10	Sure, I can give you one fact why that is the case: I come from a country that has seven and a half million, and Li Na comes from a country that has 1.6 billion. So there is not that much difference there (laughter). No, it's always individual. Everybody feels different. You can't generalize things, especially because we are coming from different countries obviously. But Li Na is a Grand Slam winner, she's top 10 player for a while. That already is a great achievement for her country. So we are about to see if she can maintain that. You can't predict anything because tennis is such a unique sport, very individual, demands a lot of commitment.	4358_10.a	2012-10-11	M	4358	Feliciano Lopez	Novak Djokovic	You are the national hero or icon for your own nation. So is Li Na for China. It feels like more of a burden for Li Na. Can you share some thoughts on that?	4358_10.q	2.0	1	3rd Round	SHANGHAI ROLEX MASTERS	Masters 1000
2511_0	Five years ago. (Smiling.) No, because sometime it happens you have some problems. But I think this is the game. Sometimes you have problem with your forehand; sometimes with your backhand and sometimes with your body. You never know what's happen. Today he had some problem with his stomach I think at the beginning of the third set, and that's it. It's good for me; bad for him. That's it.	2511_0.a	2010-01-27	M	2511	Novak Djokovic	Jo-Wilfried Tsonga	Novak talked about his problems. He had some problems during the match. When did you first notice that he was having problems?	2511_0.q	10.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
2511_1	Yeah, but I don't really know how it's important and how it affect, you know, he's affect by these things.	2511_1.a	2010-01-27	M	2511	Novak Djokovic	Jo-Wilfried Tsonga	How were you feeling at the end of the third set when you were two sets to one down?	2511_1.q	10.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
2511_2	No, when you were two sets to one down, you just think there is a fourth set. I have to play and I have to give everything. Maybe I can win, because it's not finish. (Smiling.)	2511_2.a	2010-01-27	M	2511	Novak Djokovic	Jo-Wilfried Tsonga	I mean were you feeling worried when you were two sets to one down?	2511_2.q	10.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
2511_3	What do I have to do? I have to play my best tennis. Roger played unbelievable today again, because Nikolay was in good shape, so it's gonna be tough. But like today, I will give everything and we will see.	2511_3.a	2010-01-27	M	2511	Novak Djokovic	Jo-Wilfried Tsonga	What do you have to do to beat Roger? You've beaten him before. Do you take confidence from that?	2511_3.q	10.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
2511_4	Yeah, of course. Of course. I know I can do that, but it was completely different. Now I have to win three sets, and it's gonna be difficult for sure.	2511_4.a	2010-01-27	M	2511	Novak Djokovic	Jo-Wilfried Tsonga	Is it good to know you have beaten him before? Does that give you confidence?	2511_4.q	10.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
2511_5	You know, it's good to have experience, but for that you have to win, you have to play before, you know. Roger have experience because he won, you know, like 15 or 16 Grand Slam. But he won the first one, you know, and without experience, so I think at this level you never know what's happen.	2511_5.a	2010-01-27	M	2511	Novak Djokovic	Jo-Wilfried Tsonga	Roger said in the press conference before your match against Djokovic that Djokovic had the edge and experience over you and that might help him tonight. How much is that gonna be a factor against Federer? He's got so much experience at this stage of a tournament in five-set matches compared to you.	2511_5.q	10.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
2511_6	Yeah. I think, I don't know. I feel good. I won two tough match. My two last match was tough, and I did it. Why not against Roger?	2511_6.a	2010-01-27	M	2511	Novak Djokovic	Jo-Wilfried Tsonga	So you think yourself that mentally and so on that you'll handle the occasion well?	2511_6.q	10.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
2511_7	Maybe I'm stronger, physically stronger. I think I have more than, you know, one way to play, and this is why I'm better.	2511_7.a	2010-01-27	M	2511	Novak Djokovic	Jo-Wilfried Tsonga	How do you think you are a different player from 2008 when you reached the final?	2511_7.q	10.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
2511_8	I don't know. Maybe because I have time to prepare more than the other Grand Slam because the season is long and we have to play a lot of tournament, be ready for a lot of tournaments. So sometimes it's tough to be ready for Roland Garros and Wimbledon and also US Open because we have to play, you know, tournament 1000.	2511_8.a	2010-01-27	M	2511	Novak Djokovic	Jo-Wilfried Tsonga	Why do you think you've done so well here at this tournament over the past three years compared to other places?	2511_8.q	10.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
2511_9	I don't know. I think they will cheer for Roger for sure. I don't know for me, but, you know, I will do, you know, everything and maybe after that they will like me. (Smiling.)	2511_9.a	2010-01-27	M	2511	Novak Djokovic	Jo-Wilfried Tsonga	The crowd support you have here, you seem to be very popular here. Is that something you can feed on in the next match too, do you think?	2511_9.q	10.0	1	Quarterfinals	AUSTRALIAN OPEN	Grand Slam
3363_0	Well, yeah, I mean, first of all, I wouldn't say that my season is not that good. I would say that it was really -- I would say really good one because there was a lot of high, good-quality results until I start the year. So compared to the last year of course there was the final of Wimbledon, but there was a lot of first-round exits in the tournaments. So this year that's completely different. Yeah, I mean, to bring this title, that means really a lot to me, because it's after, as you mentioned, 29 month. It was quite a long time, so I'm happy that I could broke this up. You know, I think I couldn't have a better place to win a title than here in Beijing.	3363_0.a	2011-10-09	M	3363	Marin Cilic	Tomas Berdych	Congratulations. I think this is the first title for you in almost two and a half years, especially after not-so-good season compared to last. What does it mean to you, the championship?	3363_0.q	10.0	1	The Final	CHINA OPEN	ATP500
3363_1	Yeah, well, first of all, I just need to say that Marin starts really well - I would almost say extremely well. He started with pretty much no mistakes, playing so fast from the baseline, great serving, great returning. I mean, I was just really hanging there. It was really just want to stay and win at least couple of my games of my serve, and then was waiting for some chance. When I lost the first set, I was just, All right, so now I need to start to play at least a little bit aggressive or something to change. I had a pretty good start for the second set. I made the break, and then in that moment I started to feel, yeah, that's the chance. You know, I can do it well. And even I lost my serve and I was two breaks down, I was still positive that could be the good moment to take it for my side. I think the best or like the key moment was a break when it was 5-4; Marin was serving; I made a set point and just win the second set. That moment I started to really feel great, get some more energy for the third set, and then it was just my turn in the third set.	3363_1.a	2011-10-09	M	3363	Marin Cilic	Tomas Berdych	Can you just give is an insight into how you turned the game around. You were one set down and then it was really quite tight in the second tight. What was it? What was the trigger moment that you thought, Yes, I could possibly win this?	3363_1.q	10.0	1	The Final	CHINA OPEN	ATP500
3363_2	Well, it means a lot. On the other way, it means that there are still few tournaments left in the season which are going to be really important as well: next week in Shanghai, and then definitely in Paris. There is two big weeks coming up where is really a lot of points to be split between the players. Yeah, I did a great move to have a good chance to qualify for London. Still, as I mentioned, these two weeks, you know, I still really need to do well. I want to do well. It just gives me a lot of confidence for the rest of the season and for the rest of the tournaments. So I'm really looking forward to that. I hope I can keep my level of game what I did and hopefully to win even more matches.	3363_2.a	2011-10-09	M	3363	Marin Cilic	Tomas Berdych	What does this mean to you going into the rest of the year, particularly in the run-up to London?	3363_2.q	10.0	1	The Final	CHINA OPEN	ATP500
3363_3	Well, that's a good one. (Smiling.) As I see all the winners here, then it looks like this one is not going to be the one who's going to travel with me home. So I don't know what's going to be the trophy or the size of the trophy which I'm going to be able to take home with me. So, no, I mean, I hope that, you know, all those things like with the shipping stuff is working - especially here - so I think that's going to be this option. (Smiling.)	3363_3.a	2011-10-09	M	3363	Marin Cilic	Tomas Berdych	How will you get that big cup back home?	3363_3.q	10.0	1	The Final	CHINA OPEN	ATP500
3363_4	Well, I just didn't get the question. Something about some council is going to be happening in Shanghai next week or something like that, right?	3363_4.a	2011-10-09	M	3363	Marin Cilic	Tomas Berdych	It is reported that Nadal and Murray are going to call for a players' council next week in Shanghai to talk about the schedule to the ATP. Are you going to join them? Can you confirm this?	3363_4.q	10.0	1	The Final	CHINA OPEN	ATP500
3363_5	Well, actually this is the first time that you just mention it to me that something is going to happen in Shanghai. I mean, I didn't know about it. No, I mean, if somebody come to me and ask me if I want to join them or just to listen what's could be new things or what's going to be going on there or what's the reason of it - and I'm going to have a time not to be busy with my matches schedule - okay, I can join the players. Yeah, that's the only thing I can say about it.	3363_5.a	2011-10-09	M	3363	Marin Cilic	Tomas Berdych	Players' council talking about the ATP schedule.	3363_5.q	10.0	1	The Final	CHINA OPEN	ATP500
3363_6	The Olympics are once in four years. If somebody wants to be complaining about that, well, I don't see it as a good option. That's the tournament which we have only once in four years, so I think, yeah, you can make your schedule work even for that. Yeah, I mean, I don't see any other reasons why to be complaining about to have the Olympics or not. So if you don't want to play the Olympics, don't play the Olympics. That's the option of all of us, and that's how it is. You can still have a possibility to choose the tournaments you want to play. Yeah, also, I mean, the other way is also talking about the schedule. But, I mean, we were complaining about that, that the season is long. The next year even with the Olympics is going to be two weeks shorter. So, yeah, something happens and something was changed. I mean, it's really tough to really find it always perfect way. You know, you still needs to look at it and try to find some compromise between us and the ATP. So, yeah, I think something change, which is good. We see how it's going to be for the next years. )	3363_6.a	2011-10-09	M	3363	Marin Cilic	Tomas Berdych	Are you happy with the schedule? Because they said that it's too much for the players. Especially next year there is going to be Olympics so the schedule could be really tight.	3363_6.q	10.0	1	The Final	CHINA OPEN	ATP500
3363_7	(Smiling.) Well, yeah, that's a nice idea to have, but there is another opponent waiting for me in the first round. He's going to be really hungry to beat me as a champion from Beijing. So that's the first one who I'm really looking forward to. And when I saw the draw, it possibly could be my teammate from the Davis Cup, Radek Stepanek, so it could be really interesting match for the first round. That's it. You know, I mean, I'm not really thinking about anything more in there. I just want to go step by step, same as I did it here. Yeah, that's how I just want to take it.	3363_7.a	2011-10-09	M	3363	Marin Cilic	Tomas Berdych	Can you talk about your expectation in Shanghai? Back-to-back title?	3363_7.q	10.0	1	The Final	CHINA OPEN	ATP500
2124_0	I mean, that doesn't mean a whole lot to me, being the No.2 American. I wish James, I wish he had a little better year so he could still be in the top 10. To me, that's not really that important.	2124_0.a	2009-08-27	M	2124	Nikolay Davydenko	Sam Querrey	Have you had a chance to think about what that means now, to go behind Roddick at the Open?	2124_0.q	23.0	1	Quarterfinals	PILOT PEN TENNIS PRESENTED BY SCHICK	ATP250
2124_1	Just took a couple deep breaths, really focused on my first serve. Fortunately hit two big first serves in there. You know, you see that a lot. When you save breakpoints, that next game a lot of times you see guys with breakpoints, they go ahead and convert the break. That's kind of what happened.	2124_1.a	2009-08-27	M	2124	Nikolay Davydenko	Sam Querrey	Run me through what you're thinking. You had such a great match. You're down 15-40 on your serve.	2124_1.q	23.0	1	Quarterfinals	PILOT PEN TENNIS PRESENTED BY SCHICK	ATP250
2124_2	That's one of my best friends in Los Angeles, Shane Poppen and his friends. They live here in New Haven. They can't go Samurais. We've got that patented. They would go Sam, so that's pretty cool. They're like cousins of the Samurais.	2124_2.a	2009-08-27	M	2124	Nikolay Davydenko	Sam Querrey	They weren't nearly as boisterous as L.A., but you had some Samurai guys up there. Talk about the whole fan club phenomenon.	2124_2.q	23.0	1	Quarterfinals	PILOT PEN TENNIS PRESENTED BY SCHICK	ATP250
2124_3	Yeah, I mean, it's always been a weapon. I think lately I've been throwing in a lot more variety and it's paying off. I used to kind of just do everything 130. Now I'm throwing in the kick serve sometimes on the first serve to throw guys off guard a little bit, a fake kick. Sometimes I'm adding the body serve in a little more. You know, I'm not hitting it any harder than I used to, but I'm hitting my spots a little more and using a little more variety.	2124_3.a	2009-08-27	M	2124	Nikolay Davydenko	Sam Querrey	Can you talk about how your serve is really a weapon for you, how much confidence you have.	2124_3.q	23.0	1	Quarterfinals	PILOT PEN TENNIS PRESENTED BY SCHICK	ATP250
2124_4	Uhm, I just tried to stay in the long points when I could. If you win some long like 15-, 20-rally baseline points against guys like that, I think it really hurts them. They say, All right, he's bombing serves, but he's willing to stay in long baseline rallies with me. I think that can be intimidating. I thought I won a couple long ones today. Sometimes I think guys like Davydenko, Nadal, when they see that, it's tough for them.	2124_4.a	2009-08-27	M	2124	Nikolay Davydenko	Sam Querrey	Nikolay is such a great baseline player. Obviously you rely on your serve a lot. What else did you do because of how he plays to counter that today?	2124_4.q	23.0	1	Quarterfinals	PILOT PEN TENNIS PRESENTED BY SCHICK	ATP250
2124_5	My forehand, I feel like it's always been pretty big, it's always been a weapon. But it's getting better and better. I played him like two and a half years ago. I've come a long way since then. But, yeah, I mean, every day my forehand feels better. It's my biggest weapon. Maybe that and my serve, they're both pretty close. It's feeling good right now.	2124_5.a	2009-08-27	M	2124	Nikolay Davydenko	Sam Querrey	He said you have a better forehand now, you're actually hitting winners with it. Have you done something with that? Are you hitting the ball a little bit better?	2124_5.q	23.0	1	Quarterfinals	PILOT PEN TENNIS PRESENTED BY SCHICK	ATP250
2124_6	A combination of both. A lot of it's fitness, off-court work. A lot of it's just playing a lot of matches. You get fitter when you're playing matches. Like you said, I'm learning to anticipate a little better. That makes you look faster. I think Federer anticipates better than anyone. That makes him look like he's not even trying out there and he's getting every ball.	2124_6.a	2009-08-27	M	2124	Nikolay Davydenko	Sam Querrey	He also said you're running better. Is that a result of fitness or better court awareness out there?	2124_6.q	23.0	1	Quarterfinals	PILOT PEN TENNIS PRESENTED BY SCHICK	ATP250
2124_7	"Uhm, a little bit. A lot of it depends upon your body type. You know, you take Roddick, myself, Mardy Fish, John Isner, we're all 6'3"" or taller. We're going to go big serve, big forehand. You have a guy like James, he doesn't quite have the serve, but he's got a return. Same with Robby Ginepri. They're more kind of return and speed and craftiness. A little bit of it depends kind of on your body type. For the most part I think most Americans, you know, rely on big serve and they're looking to step up and take the first ball and whack it with a forehand or a backhand and kind of look to move forward, not necessarily come in."	2124_7.a	2009-08-27	M	2124	Nikolay Davydenko	Sam Querrey	He also said your play is kind of an all American style right now. I'm not sure what he meant, but do you see similarities in the top Americans' games that you would be lumped together?	2124_7.q	23.0	1	Quarterfinals	PILOT PEN TENNIS PRESENTED BY SCHICK	ATP250
2124_8	I think you misread that. Fourth round. Yeah, I mean, it's tough to look ahead to the fourth round. You know, that could be great. I'd be stoked if I made the fourth round again. If I got a chance at Nikolay again, that would be great. I'd be going into that match with confidence, knowing that I beat him here. We each have to win three rounds before we get there.	2124_8.a	2009-08-27	M	2124	Nikolay Davydenko	Sam Querrey	I don't know if you have seen the draw for the Open. If you both are able to advance, you would see Nikolay again in the third round. Would that be an advantage to either of you?	2124_8.q	23.0	1	Quarterfinals	PILOT PEN TENNIS PRESENTED BY SCHICK	ATP250
2124_9	It helps a lot. I started out today, I won eight points in a row I think. I went up 3-0 really quickly. I feel like I've been starting well lately. I think in all three matches I broke early in the first set. It's nice when you come out to like a booming start like that. You know, it sets you up well confidence-wise for the rest of the match.	2124_9.a	2009-08-27	M	2124	Nikolay Davydenko	Sam Querrey	When you come out in a match, you get to serve, first two serves are aces, how does that set you up for the rest of the match confidence-wise?	2124_9.q	23.0	1	Quarterfinals	PILOT PEN TENNIS PRESENTED BY SCHICK	ATP250
2124_10	Yeah, obviously if you've got extra pressure on you, it's a good thing. You're doing something right. I mean, I don't really feel too much pressure. Since yesterday, I clinched the US Open Series, I kind of went out there today with no pressure, just kind of swinging away. I think that's why I started so well. You know, I'm not feeling pressure. I'm just going out there, working hard, doing the things that I need to do. You know, whatever happens happens. I don't really care who's putting pressure on me. I'm not playing for that person; I'm just playing for myself.	2124_10.a	2009-08-27	M	2124	Nikolay Davydenko	Sam Querrey	Can you talk about expectations and pressure, the more success you have, the more expectations are put on you, how you respond to that and how you use that?	2124_10.q	23.0	1	Quarterfinals	PILOT PEN TENNIS PRESENTED BY SCHICK	ATP250
2124_11	We call him an intern, not an assistant. We don't give him the assistant title (laughter).	2124_11.a	2009-08-27	M	2124	Nikolay Davydenko	Sam Querrey	Your assistant got some pretty big-time ink in Sports Illustrated.	2124_11.q	23.0	1	Quarterfinals	PILOT PEN TENNIS PRESENTED BY SCHICK	ATP250
2124_12	Yeah, I mean, the Sports Illustrated article started out with Dan Farrugia. He was in bold right there in the beginning. He wants to be a sports and entertainment lawyer. He wants to be involved on this side. He's taken six months off, the first semester off at Cornell, traveling with me, getting the inside look into sports. Ever since he's been with me, I've been on a tear. I kind of don't want him to leave. It's cool. It's cool with him. He's a friend that I've got on the road. He's been here the whole time. I keep going up in the rankings. It's fun. The higher ranked you are, the more perks you get. It's more fun when you're winning a lot. So we're just having a good time.	2124_12.a	2009-08-27	M	2124	Nikolay Davydenko	Sam Querrey	Have you teased him? Can you talk about enjoying the ride up in sports, a pretty fun thing for young guys.	2124_12.q	23.0	1	Quarterfinals	PILOT PEN TENNIS PRESENTED BY SCHICK	ATP250
2124_13	Yeah. The Samurai started like three years ago with a couple of my friends at the L.A. Open. There's seven original Samurais, and Dan Farrugia is one of them. There's not really a leader. I mean, I guess you could say Dan, my other friend Wes and my other friend Shane, those guys are kind of the backbone. They kind of organize everything, keep everyone in line. Most of the guys have no clue about tennis. So they'll cheer out during points. They need to kind of settle them down. But, no, it's fun. I mean, those guys out in L.A., that was awesome. There were 35 or 40 of them coming out for every match. To see them here now, it's kind of cool. It makes tennis fun, I think.	2124_13.a	2009-08-27	M	2124	Nikolay Davydenko	Sam Querrey	Was he the one that created this Samurai phenomenon or had that been building? It's got to be fun to see those guys chanting like crazy.	2124_13.q	23.0	1	Quarterfinals	PILOT PEN TENNIS PRESENTED BY SCHICK	ATP250
2124_14	Maybe next year. This is a tough week because a lot of them are back in school now. And it's a long way out here. But, you know, maybe next year. Some of them are starting to graduate. If they don't have jobs, maybe they can come out here.	2124_14.a	2009-08-27	M	2124	Nikolay Davydenko	Sam Querrey	Indianapolis flew a few of your friends out. Are you going to talk to Anne about getting a few more out here tomorrow?	2124_14.q	23.0	1	Quarterfinals	PILOT PEN TENNIS PRESENTED BY SCHICK	ATP250
1060_0	Yeah, absolutely.  I've been on the receiving end of, you know, defeats from him in the other Slams.  Yeah, just the whole nature of the match - not only the level of play but the support, the atmosphere out on a big court, it was fantastic. So, yeah, it's good.  I appreciate the situation, this being my last tournament.	1060_0.a	2007-08-29	M	1060	Dmitry Tursunov	Tim Henman	You must be very pleased with that.	1060_0.q	91.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1060_1	Yeah, no, it's been a while.  I think I played very, very well against Moya at Wimbledon.  But, you know, besides that, I wouldn't say there's a lot else to talk about this year. So, yeah, it's fantastic.  I think that's probably been one of the frustrating aspects, is that I've been able to play, you know, very well in practice.  But, you know, it's an overall consistency thing.  I think that can be dictated by, you know, my body, some of the back issues I've had.  But I felt great out there.	1060_1.a	2007-08-29	M	1060	Dmitry Tursunov	Tim Henman	How long has it been since you've played that well?	1060_1.q	91.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1060_2	Yeah, no, it is.  It's difficult.  You know, he is a tough guy to play, as you guys have seen better than most. But I think the conditions played a big part.  You look at all the other matches we've played certainly in slams, it's been so much heavier.  That gives him such a margin for error, I think most importantly on his second serve.  When it's heavy, it's cold, I think in both Australia and Paris, he can be so aggressive with his second serve.  It's really never going to fly. Whereas today, with me being aggressive, looking to chip-charge, he starts to feel that a little bit more.  The ball starts flying, he starts to serve double-faults.  There's a cumulative effect, start having an impact and start making him think a little bit. I think add to that I was -- the balls on the court help me a little bit on my serve, give me a little bit extra.  You know, that combination was very, very good today.	1060_2.a	2007-08-29	M	1060	Dmitry Tursunov	Tim Henman	Must have been nice not to have gone out in a straight-sets defeat today.	1060_2.q	91.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1060_3	Well, I don't -- I think in some respects it would be easy to say yes.  I think in other respects, you know, I've been able to play, you know, with a lot of freedom over the last couple years.  I definitely reflect on, you know, early, middle parts of my career where I was almost out there trying, you know, too hard.  There was sort of self-inflicted pressure. No, you know, I think I look at the way, you know, I played a lot of tournaments in 2004, you know, I was playing in a similar fashion.  But there's no doubt, you know, when I've struggled with my injuries, then it can be frustrating, and that's always going to have a knock-on effect of your sort of state of mind on the court. But I feel really good physically on the court.  I was obviously, you know, going to enjoy it mentally.  I played really well, as well.	1060_3.a	2007-08-29	M	1060	Dmitry Tursunov	Tim Henman	Is there any sense that there's a release, having done what you've done, your approach is slightly different?	1060_3.q	91.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1060_4	Yeah, I mean, you know, if I had lost in straight sets today, I don't think it would have been the biggest deal in the world.  But having said that, yeah, to play against him of all people, having lost to him on four of five occasions, and play that well, it's great.  It certainly leaves -- yeah, sort of leaves a good taste.  And it's something I can build on definitely.  Because I am, I'm keen -- I think when you say I've got nothing to lose and a lot to gain, I think that's spot on.  I feel like I want to play these last two events and give them everything.  You know, if I do play well and go out on a high, whatever that means, it will mean a lot to me. But on the other, you know, side of the coin, you know, if I hadn't won today and things didn't go according to plan at Davis Cup, it's not suddenly going to tarnish my career in any way, shape or form. So, yeah, I think with that attitude, it could bode pretty well.	1060_4.a	2007-08-29	M	1060	Dmitry Tursunov	Tim Henman	Compared to other wins in your career, what degree of satisfaction do you get from this?	1060_4.q	91.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1060_5	Oh, yeah.  I can't please everyone (smiling).  Blame adidas.	1060_5.a	2007-08-29	M	1060	Dmitry Tursunov	Tim Henman	Can I add on a fashion note?  JP will be spinning in his grave seeing you after such a good win wearing Cambridge blue.	1060_5.q	91.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1060_6	I care, yeah.  Yeah, I care about my career.  I think there's a few others that do, as well. But I'm not quite sure what the point Marat is trying to convey there.	1060_6.a	2007-08-29	M	1060	Dmitry Tursunov	Tim Henman	Earlier today Marat Safin said that when he looks back on his victory here, he kind of thinks, So what?  It was in the past, nobody cares.  I'm wondering what you think of that when you look back on your career?  Do you think people do care?	1060_6.q	91.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1060_7	Sure, absolutely.  But you can still be proud of your past achievements.  But, you know, from a sports point of view, you're always living for today and trying to do your best today.  Maybe that's what he was trying to get across.	1060_7.a	2007-08-29	M	1060	Dmitry Tursunov	Tim Henman	He's saying he doesn't want to live in the past; that you have to live in the present.	1060_7.q	91.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1060_8	I saw him play a little bit before the grass court tournaments in England.  He was impressive.  He played some great tennis. I don't think he's too dissimilar from Tursunov.  He's a great athlete, serves big, hits the ball aggressively from the baseline.  But I think, you know, if I can play in the same fashion as I did today, play at the same level, then I think I'll create opportunities.  I think I'll have a good chance.	1060_8.a	2007-08-29	M	1060	Dmitry Tursunov	Tim Henman	You will play against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga.	1060_8.q	91.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1060_9	Yeah, it's good.  I think after I lost in Cincinnati, you know, I was probably hitting every other day, then just doing a lot of work in the gym.  That's the best way for it to settle down. I felt great on the court.  And I think it will be fine tomorrow.  It's just, you know, I understand once you start playing back-to-back, the work load increases, it can get sore.  But I think I should be all right.	1060_9.a	2007-08-29	M	1060	Dmitry Tursunov	Tim Henman	Has the back settled down a little bit?	1060_9.q	91.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
1060_10	Yeah, just straightaway get on the bike and start to, you know, loosen things up, then a lot of stretching.  Then, you know, pretty long massage, a lot more stretching.  A lot more stretching tomorrow, just to keep my lower back, you know, the joints, the muscles, as loose as possible.  I think I should be okay.	1060_10.a	2007-08-29	M	1060	Dmitry Tursunov	Tim Henman	What do you have to do when you go off court?  What have you had done to you?	1060_10.q	91.0	1	1st Round	U.S. OPEN	Grand Slam
