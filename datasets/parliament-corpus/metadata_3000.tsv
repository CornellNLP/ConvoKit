2007-07-25.0.0	"Mr. Speaker, we had the Adjournment debate yesterday, and in it we covered much of the territory in the hon Gentleman's question. However, I shall start with the facts. This year's budget for the Police Service of Northern Ireland is £100 million more than it was two years ago. As for the CSR discussions, I assure him that we want to maintain the same police numbers—that is, 7,500 officers—as we have at the moment. For obvious reasons, that is rather more than one would find in the average police service in the rest of the UK. What matters too is how those resources are deployed. That is very important, and the Chief Constable's commitment to neighbourhood policing is very welcome.
The right hon Member for Lagan Valley (Mr. Donaldson) touches on another important issue that no doubt will be touched on later in our proceedings today. We cannot go on spending on investigations into the past without there being a knock-on effect on both present and future services. The CSR considerations that are going on at the moment will be important in that respect, but I am committed to making sure that we continue to provide the necessary funding for the PSNI, and I am determined that that will happen."	2007-07-25b.822.0	I thank the Minister for his response. He will be aware that the Northern Ireland Policing Board and the Chief Constable are concerned about a possible reduction in the police budget in the forthcoming financial year, and that there are increasing pressures on the budget as a result of policing the past, the ongoing inquiries, and the cost of the legal advice that the police need to secure in order to participate in them. However, does he agree that it is right that the Government provide adequate funding for the ordinary policing in the community that tackles all the matters that concern the people of Northern Ireland? Does he accept that there should not be a reduction in the police budget, given the increasing costs of the inquiries that I have mentioned? Will the Government do something to reduce the cost of the inquiries, and ensure that adequate policing is provided for all the victims of crime in Northern Ireland?	2007-07-25b.821.8	person/10172	person/10232	True	2007-07-25	brown	False	False	0	Northern Ireland	Northern Ireland	Policing	1	dup	False	False	labour	True	False
2007-07-25.0.1	I assure my hon Friend that the Government are fully signed up to what he describes as the Patten vision, and that we will continue to deliver on it. That will include making sure that the PSNI reflects more fully the composition of Northern Ireland's population. Over the past three years, we have committed £178 million to fulfilling the Patten vision for policing in Northern Ireland. He has told the House about the events in Derry, and I of course join him and others in condemning dissident republicans who continue to think that violence and conflict are the way forward, when the truth is that politics is the way forward. Equally, however, I condemn those loyalist paramilitaries who were involved in the shooting of a police officer at the weekend. That is just as damnable, and such actions are increasingly marginal in a Northern Ireland society where real politics is taking over and determining the future.	2007-07-25b.822.2	Will the Minister assure the House that budget constraints in the future will not curb or compromise the roll-out and full implementation of the Patten vision for policing? This morning, the Police Service has had to seal off a number of streets in Derry city centre because of hoax devices. Will he join me in condemning the so-called dissident republicans responsible for such attacks? At a time when Derry city centre is seeing the fruits of normalisation and the removal of military installations, the attacks serve only to bring the British Army, in the form of the bomb disposal units, back on to the streets there.	2007-07-25b.822.1	person/11589	person/10232	False	2007-07-25	brown	False	False	0	Northern Ireland	Northern Ireland	Policing	0	social-democratic-and-labour-party	False	False	labour	True	False
2007-07-25.0.2	The special fund of £34 million that we have provided for the historical inquiries team to look into the unresolved murders of the years of the troubles is, of course, additional money that does not come out of the day-to-day policing budget. It is important that we focus all the resources that we can on day-to-day policing—that is, on neighbourhood policing and dealing with antisocial behaviour, for example—but we must also deal with the remaining threats from dissident republicans, loyalist paramilitaries or those involved in organised crime networks. I know that the hon Gentleman cares very deeply about such matters, and that he will agree that we must remain very strongly focused on them.	2007-07-25b.823.0	Does not the Minister's very proper condemnation of the events of yesterday and the weekend underline the necessity for keeping an absolutely first-class police force in Northern Ireland, under the inspired leadership of an admirable Chief Constable? Will he ring-fence expenditure on the past and try to ensure that is totally separate from the running budget for police needs?	2007-07-25b.822.3	person/10134	person/10232	False	2007-07-25	brown	False	False	0	Northern Ireland	Northern Ireland	Policing	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2007-07-25.0.3	I am grateful to my hon Friend for raising that issue. He is right: where assets are seized and turned back into cash, it can be put back into front-line police services. I am pleased to say that with some of that money the Police Service of Northern Ireland has just taken on 60 new financial investigators, who will further improve the capacity for that work. The ARA is doing a tremendous job in Northern Ireland and its work will be redoubled and strengthened when it merges with the Serious Organised Crime Agency next year. Of course, partnership with our colleagues in the Republic is also an important element of that work.	2007-07-25b.823.2	Does my hon Friend agree that the Assets Recovery Agency has an important role to play in deterring crime, as well as potentially obtaining more funds for policing in Northern Ireland? Can he outline the progress the Government have made in obtaining funds through that source?	2007-07-25b.823.1	person/10683	person/10232	False	2007-07-25	brown	False	False	0	Northern Ireland	Northern Ireland	Policing	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2007-07-25.0.4	"On behalf of my right hon Friend, may I express our sympathies to the hon Gentleman and his constituents for the difficulties that they face?
At 7,500, the PSNI has greater strength than any other police service in the United Kingdom. Significantly, confidence in the PSNI shows an encouraging story: 75 per cent. of people in Northern Ireland express full confidence in the police service that they receive. We should all take encouragement from that."	2007-07-25b.823.4	"I congratulate the Secretary of State and the Minister on their appointments and thank them very much for their kindness this week following the terrible flooding in my constituency. I apologise to you, Mr. Speaker, and the House for having to leave shortly after this question to attend to those problems.
Given that the security situation has improved so much, is it not rather unfortunate that over the past 10 years the level of policing has dropped from 8,500 to 7,500 officers, and also that the full-time reservist force has dropped from 3,000 to fewer than 700 and the part-time reservist force from 1,300 to fewer than 900? Although we hope that the security situation continues to improve, are not those figures of a little concern to the Minister?"	2007-07-25b.823.3	person/10505	person/10232	False	2007-07-25	brown	False	False	0	Northern Ireland	Northern Ireland	Policing	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2007-07-25.1.0	"I thank the hon Gentleman for his kind remarks.
The matter is now devolved and it is for the Executive in Northern Ireland, so it would be inappropriate for me to comment on it. Suffice it to say that it is under review; the Executive are looking at a business case and I understand that they will bring it back in the autumn."	2007-07-25b.824.4	I congratulate the Secretary of State on his appointment and thank him for that reply. The estimated cost of building a national stadium at the Long Kesh Maze site is between £43 million and £400 million. Will the right hon Gentleman give the House a definitive figure, to the extent that he is able to do so, after taking account of all contingency and additional costs?	2007-07-25b.824.3	person/11475	person/10651	True	2007-07-25	brown	False	False	0	Northern Ireland	Northern Ireland	Maze Prison Site	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2007-07-25.1.1	In so far as it is appropriate for me to do so, yes.	2007-07-25b.824.6	I thank the Secretary of State for that reply. He will be aware that the people of Northern Ireland are pleased that the question of the future of the Maze is now in the hands of the Northern Ireland Assembly, but will he make sure that every piece of information relating to the stadium is put into the public domain so that people such as Northern Ireland football supporters do not have to go to freedom of information legislation to obtain information about various aspects of the process that seem to have been kept very secret? Will he assure the Minister for Finance and Personnel in Northern Ireland that every bit of information will be put into the public domain?	2007-07-25b.824.5	person/10282	person/10651	False	2007-07-25	brown	False	False	0	Northern Ireland	Northern Ireland	Maze Prison Site	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2007-07-25.1.2	"I reassure the hon Gentleman that, of course, this is now a matter for the Executive—the final decision will be theirs—but I remind him that when direct rule Ministers looked at the issue, it was the subject of enormous consultation and that the decision was endorsed by all three major sporting bodies—those for soccer, rugby and Gaelic football? However, these are now matters for the Executive.
In respect of the hon Gentleman's observations about what some have described as a terrorist shrine, there is no question of its being a terrorist shrine and, frankly, to suggest that it is, as I think that he knows, denigrates the work done by the Maze consultation panel. It came up with proposals and a way forward on all this, and it would be best to remember the words of the Deputy First Minister, who said yesterday:
""I am not arguing for any kind of shrine...If we want a conflict transformation centre, then it has to concentrate on how we resolve conflict."""	2007-07-25b.825.0	The Secretary of State will be well aware of the almost total opposition of Northern Ireland football supporters to the siting of the stadium at the Maze. He will also be aware of the total opposition of Unionists to the provision of a shrine to hunger strikers at the Maze—something that is already happening, promoted by Sinn Fein. Will he give an assurance that no agreements made in the past by direct rule Ministers or actions taken by direct rule Ministers in the future will limit the ability of the Executive and the Assembly in Northern Ireland to be the final arbiters of what happens to the Maze site and the location of the national stadium?	2007-07-25b.824.7	person/11374	person/10651	False	2007-07-25	brown	False	False	0	Northern Ireland	Northern Ireland	Maze Prison Site	0	dup	False	False	labour	True	False
2007-07-25.2.0	As the hon Gentleman knows, the historical inquiries team was specifically set up by the Chief Constable to focus on providing resolution, where possible, for the families affected by those deaths in a way that would command the confidence of the wider community. There is no question but that it has been successful, particularly in its specific purpose of engaging with families. As for prosecutions, that is, of course, a matter for the Chief Constable.	2007-07-25b.825.7	Has the Secretary of State made any assessment of how many of the 3,268 murders related to the security situation that are being investigated by the historical inquiry team are likely to lead to the establishment of a separate public inquiry?	2007-07-25b.825.6	person/11588	person/10651	True	2007-07-25	brown	False	False	0	Northern Ireland	Northern Ireland	Historical Inquiries	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2007-07-25.2.1	Undoubtedly, the costs of the Bloody Sunday inquiry are higher than many people would like. Of course, the Government are committed to ensuring not only that the inquiry has the resources to do the job, but that we can bring about best value for money for the public purse. The fact of the matter is that, as the right hon Gentleman knows, justice must take its course. The inquiry has had to interview more than 900 witnesses. There have been endless judicial review proceedings. None the less, it is now proceeding towards its end, and we expect and hope that its resolution will come soon.	2007-07-25b.826.1	Does the Secretary of State accept that those of us who supported setting up the Bloody Sunday inquiry would not have done so if we had known that, by now, it would cost £180 million? It has not yet concluded, and it almost certainly has not brought the closure that we all desired.	2007-07-25b.826.0	person/10391	person/10651	True	2007-07-25	brown	False	False	0	Northern Ireland	Northern Ireland	Historical Inquiries	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2007-07-25.2.2	The conduct of most of the inquiries that are taking place is already set out, and they are already proceeding along their courses. A number of inquiries are under way. I am not quite sure which inquiry the hon Gentleman is referring to, but I am happy to discuss that with him or to pursue it by letter. Of course, inquiry matters are for me to set out, but once under way, they are matters for the chairman or the judge involved.	2007-07-25b.826.3	"I apologise for not have heard all the answer, Mr. Speaker.
The Secretary of State has been helpful in what he has said, but will he tell me whether he in the Department or someone in the devolved Administration decides which inquiry will take place and determines the extent of the investigation and the budgetary parameters? Who decides whether it is appropriate to hold an inquiry and on what terms?"	2007-07-25b.826.2	person/13736	person/10651	True	2007-07-25	brown	False	False	0	Northern Ireland	Northern Ireland	Historical Inquiries	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2007-07-25.2.3	There is no question in anybody's mind of inquiries being confused with vendettas. The inquiries are there precisely to establish the truth, and it is absolutely right that they continue to do so. However, the hon Gentleman makes an important point about the future of inquiries and how we handle the past. That is why my predecessor—I pay tribute to the work that he did not only in this area, but during his entire time as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland over the previous two years—set up the consultative group. Its purpose, under Robin Eames and Denis Bradley, is to see whether, across the entire community of Northern Ireland, we can find a consensus on how to deal with the past. There is no question but that we must continue to discover the truth about the past. That will never be sacrificed. However, we also have to find a way to deal with the past that does not leave us in a divided past, but allows us to use our inquiries as a way of healing for the future.	2007-07-25b.826.5	The Secretary of State says that justice must take its course, but does he accept that many of the innocent victims in Northern Ireland see no justice? What they see is hundreds of millions of pounds being spent for political purposes by the Government and others to pursue a vendetta against the security forces and those who work to defeat terrorism. I welcome the Secretary of State to his new position, but will he do something to redress the balance in favour of the victims and against the terrorists and those who would seek to rewrite history?	2007-07-25b.826.4	person/10857	person/10651	False	2007-07-25	brown	False	False	0	Northern Ireland	Northern Ireland	Historical Inquiries	0	dup	False	False	labour	True	False
2007-07-25.2.4	I welcome the hon Gentleman to his post and I am sure that he will be extremely successful. I also welcome the co-operation that he has already offered me in my job. I agree with most of what he said, but, on the other hand, I cannot second-guess the outcome of the work of Lord Eames and Denis Bradley. I have every confidence that if a consensus can be found on how to deal with the past for the future, they are the people who will help to find it from within the community. It is my intention to publish the findings of their report, but that will be based on consultation with them.	2007-07-25b.827.1	I welcome the Secretary of State and the Minister of State to their new positions and offer the best wishes of my party to them in doing what remains, potentially, a very difficult job. I share many of the concerns about the price of the inquiries, but we should never lose sight of their value. The Secretary of State just referred to the Bradley and Eames commission on the past. Does he accept that that is an inquiry of a different order? Will he ensure that its deliberations are properly resourced and that any recommendations it makes will be properly implemented?	2007-07-25b.827.0	person/10785	person/10651	False	2007-07-25	brown	False	False	0	Northern Ireland	Northern Ireland	Historical Inquiries	0	liberal-democrat	False	False	labour	True	False
2007-07-25.2.5	"Since the hon Gentleman invites me to look at the past, and the time when we were both elected, I will say to him that it took me two years to realise that the Conservatives were the party of the past and that Labour remains and will be the party of the future. Even though he has remained in the Conservative party for eight years longer than I did, if he wants to come across now, I am sure that we can always find a place for him here.
In relation to the hon Gentleman's question about the cost of future inquiries, in the case of the four public inquiries currently under way, we anticipate further expenditure of about £60 million. We have set aside for the historical inquiries team £34 million, of which £10 million has already been spent, leaving a further £24 million, which we expect to be spent by the various agencies in Northern Ireland in looking at the past."	2007-07-25b.827.3	I welcome the new Secretary of State to his office and wish him well. We were both elected as Conservative MPs in 1997 and it is an interesting reflection on the different ways in which we have spent the past 10 years that we hold our current posts. I intend to build on the sterling work of my hon Friend the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington) , who supported the Government through the current process, but did not offer them a blank cheque. On the question of cheques, will the Secretary of State estimate the total cost of all the current and future inquires, and say when he thinks they may be completed?	2007-07-25b.827.2	person/10473	person/10651	False	2007-07-25	brown	False	False	2	Northern Ireland	Northern Ireland	Historical Inquiries	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2007-07-25.3.0	The hon Gentleman is right to point out that we need to deal with not just the supply of, but the demand for, illegal drugs in prisons. I was at Hydebank Wood prison earlier this week, and I saw the work of an organisation called Opportunity Youth, which works to support, help and counsel young people there. Its results are very good, in terms of lowering recidivism rates and ensuring a worthwhile future for those young people. When the director brings his recommendations to me, I expect him to include measures that will give people support and help in dealing with their addiction problems.	2007-07-25b.828.7	Given that so many prisoners are heavily dependent on drugs when convicted, and that so many prisoners suffer from mental illness through drug use, what extra measures will the Minister introduce to encourage the rehabilitation of prisoners while they are in jail, so that they come off drugs?	2007-07-25b.828.6	person/11661	person/10232	True	2007-07-25	brown	False	False	0	Northern Ireland	Northern Ireland	Prisons (Illegal Drugs)	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2007-07-25.3.1	Of course, sentencing is a matter for the judiciary, rather than Ministers, but I know that the hon Gentleman is concerned with the need to make sure that for serious offences, particularly sexual crime and drugs offences, the punishment fits the crime. I can tell him and the rest of the House that later in the year I will bring forward proposals for a reform of the sentencing framework in Northern Ireland, which will include the possibility of tougher sentences for dangerous and violent offenders.	2007-07-25b.829.2	In the Minister's opinion, are the sentences handed down by the courts in Northern Ireland for drug-related offences— [Interruption.]	2007-07-25b.828.8	person/11892	person/10232	False	2007-07-25	brown	False	False	0	Northern Ireland	Northern Ireland	Prisons (Illegal Drugs)	1	dup	False	False	labour	True	False
2007-07-25.3.2	Of course my hon Friend is right: the problem of drugs in prisons, regrettable as it is, is not unique to Northern Ireland. It affects the prison system in Scotland, England and Wales, too, and it requires drug testing to take place. There are also issues of support for those with an addiction problem. I assure him that we will continue to pay attention to the subject, and to invest in it, and we will continue to learn about what works best from prisons in other jurisdictions.	2007-07-25b.829.4	My hon Friend will know that it is not just in Northern Ireland that drugs coming into prisons are a problem; recently in Scotland, a solicitor was sent to jail for bringing drugs into prison. Will he ensure that there is adequate funding in Northern Ireland, not only for searches—we must make sure that they are much more sophisticated—but to ensure that the consequences for people convicted of bringing drugs into prisons are advertised, so that people know what they are up against when they do it?	2007-07-25b.829.3	person/10684	person/10232	False	2007-07-25	brown	False	False	0	Northern Ireland	Northern Ireland	Prisons (Illegal Drugs)	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

I give them my full support as the Minister, and also as the chairman of the organised crime taskforce. We must stop drugs poisoning the lives of young people in communities in Northern Ireland, and none of us should rest until that is the case.	2007-07-25b.829.9	Home Office statistics show that since 1998, when the current method of recording crime was introduced, there has been an increase of 35.5 per cent. in recorded drug trafficking offences.

2007-07-25.5.0	I have studied the case that the Opposition have been making. Last week they quoted the National Association of Probation Officers, which says that it is not opposed to the end-of-custody licences. It has no objection in principle to them at all. As for the hon Gentleman's point about tagging and home detention curfew, the people who were let out were let out four and a half months early under home detention curfew. The people who were let out in the past few weeks were let out on 6 July , whereas otherwise they would have been let out on 24 July . There was only 18 days' difference. The major change that we have made as a Government over the past few weeks is to build more prison places, which the Opposition could not afford because they would not have the money to do it.	2007-07-25b.830.6	Since the right hon Gentleman became Prime Minister, he has allowed the release from prison of 951 criminals who had been judged too dangerous to release from prison on a tag.

2007-07-25.5.1	Let me join my hon Friend in expressing my sympathy to all the people in the Gloucester, Tewkesbury and related areas who have suffered an enormous amount of inconvenience as a result of the storms and then the floods. I also pay tribute to the emergency services—the police, the fire services, the Army and all those who have worked to try to get supplies into the areas and to make sure that the utilities are back serving the people. My hon Friend is right that Mythe water station failed. He is right that we would like it back in use as quickly as possible. He is also right that all the civil engineering capacity that can be brought to bear is being brought to bear. The water works were polluted. There is, therefore, a danger that the water pouring out from there would contaminate local people. We have made it clear to the Severn water company that it has to provide the bowsers for the area. Nine hundred have already been provided, and 900 will be provided within the next day. Drinking water is being provided through the retail stores. I think that the company has discharged its duty in ensuring that that water is available. Obviously we want Mythe water station back as quickly as possible. I will visit the area later today, and I have invited the hon Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson) and Gloucestershire Members on both sides of the House to join me on that visit, when we will see at first hand how things are progressing. I think that the House owes a debt of gratitude to all the emergency services, and we will do everything we can to get supplies restored as quickly as possible.	2007-07-25b.831.0	I thank my right hon Friend and all the other Ministers for the interest that they have taken in Gloucestershire. I pay due regard to the emergency services for the superb work that they have undertaken, and I pass on my commiserations to my colleagues in the county and all their constituents. However, can it be right that we are told that it will take 14 days to get back our main drinking supplies? There is much misinformation about who is off the mains supply and who is likely to be off. All the businesses, farms and individual households want some certainty. It cannot be the case that we must wait so long in this day and age because of the present crisis. For some time Severn Trent has needed to understand that it must act more quickly. I hope my right hon Friend will make sure that that happens.	2007-07-25b.830.7	person/10177	person/10068	False	2007-07-25	brown	True	False	0	Prime Minister	Prime Minister	Engagements	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

I have seen at first hand the superb work they are doing, and I look forward to meeting them later today. I also agree that the sympathies that go out to those who have been disconnected and those who are without vital supplies are shared by the whole House. We will have to consider what is to happen in the future. Of course, the main thing at the moment is to make people secure, to prevent any further incidents, and to do what we can to give people the supplies that they need.
The review was set up as a result of what happened in Yorkshire and Humberside. It is to help us to understand why the flooding has been so extensive and why we are seeing such extreme weather conditions, but also to learn lessons for the future. The siting of infrastructure is one issue that I think that the right hon Gentleman will agree about; the provision of supplies for dealing with floods is another. Drainage is an issue that has become particularly relevant because of what is happening on the roads. All those issues will be investigated in full, and I believe that the report that he will see when it comes out later this year will be extensive in considering both what has happened and what needs to be done. I hope that there will be an all-party consensus that we need to invest more in preventing floods in the future."	2007-07-25b.832.0	"I join the Prime Minister in sending my condolences to the families of Lance-Corporal Timothy Flowers and Senior Aircraftsmen Matthew Caulwell, Christopher Dunsmore and Peter McFerran, all of whom were killed in Iraq. Their deaths are a reminder of the daily sacrifices that our young men and women are making on our behalf, and we honour their memory.
I join the Prime Minister and the hon Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) in praising the emergency services and local councils for the vital work that they are doing in dealing with the floods. The sympathy of the whole House will go out to those who have lost loved ones, those who have been flooded out or evacuated, and those who have had property damaged or lost.
Looking to the future and how we minimise the risk of future flooding, at least five times in the past decade the House has been told that co-ordination between the Environment Agency and local councils needs to improve. I welcome the review that the Prime Minister has set up. Can he confirm that it will look into co-ordination to ensure that this time it really is delivered, and will he ensure that we do everything possible to protect key infrastructure in the future?"	2007-07-25b.831.1	person/10777	person/10068	False	2007-07-25	brown	True	False	5	Prime Minister	Prime Minister	Engagements	1	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False

2007-07-25.5.4	I am grateful to the right hon and learned Gentleman because that is exactly what we have to do. If we are dealing with extreme weather conditions, as we are, and if we are dealing with the situation that we found in Yorkshire and Humberside, and particularly in Gloucester, where a month's rain fell within an hour, we have to look at whether the precautions we have taken in the past are satisfactory, whether infrastructure is sited in the right place, and whether drainage arrangements made in the 19th and 20th centuries are suitable for 21st century conditions. I assure him that the review has sufficiently wide terms of reference—I could read them out, but I shall pass them on to him—for all these issues to be looked at. But again, all parties will have to agree that further expenditure on infrastructure will be necessary, and that it will be a public expenditure requirement for the country.	2007-07-25b.834.0	"Once again, I associate myself with the expressions of condolence and sympathy that we have just heard from the Prime Minister, and like him, I wish to pay tribute to the local authorities, the armed services and the emergency services, some of whose work I have seen for myself.
The Prime Minister acknowledged the importance of infrastructure, particularly water treatment plants and power stations. In the review to which he has referred, set up by the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, will there be a detailed assessment of the precautions available to all such infrastructural facilities throughout the country, and not just those in the areas affected during the past few weeks?"	2007-07-25b.833.4	person/10088	person/10068	False	2007-07-25	brown	True	False	2	Prime Minister	Prime Minister	Engagements	0	liberal-democrat	False	False	labour	True	False

However, due to a combination of factors, including the smoking ban, the removal of amusement games and the high taxation that bingo clubs face, 21 clubs have already closed in Scotland alone. Will my right hon Friend agree to meet me and representatives of the industry to ascertain whether we can find a way forward, especially through value added tax, to try to preserve as many of our bingo clubs as possible?	2007-07-25b.834.3	person/10305	person/10068	False	2007-07-25	brown	True	False	0	Prime Minister	Prime Minister	Engagements	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

I have to tell the right hon Gentleman that, if he examines each aspect of the treaty and what we secured in our negotiations, he should support it, not oppose it. The first issue is the charter of rights—it is non-justiciable in British law, so we secured our negotiating objective. The second is justice and home affairs—we have an opt-in, so we secured our negotiating objective. The third issue is security, foreign affairs and defence policy, which remains intergovernmental, so we secured our objective. The fourth is social security—no expenditure affecting us will be made without an emergency brake that we can put on, so we secured our negotiating objective. National security will remain a matter for individual Governments, so we secured our negotiating objective. He might be better off, in the interests of unity within his own party, looking at what the chair of his democracy taskforce said only a few days ago.

We will have to make a decision about moving to an overwatch role in a fourth province. I do not think that we would be doing the Iraqi Government or our commitments to the United Nations any service by setting an artificial timetable now.
I agree with the hon Gentleman, however, that we must support the effort in Afghanistan. It is the front line against the Taliban, and this is where we would like to see greater burden sharing by all our NATO and other allies. It is also where our Army and our defence forces are doing an excellent job, as they are in Iraq.

1982-12-01.0.0	I note with sympathy the hon Gentleman's point about Swindon. He will appreciate that it is for British Rail to decide on its refurbishment programme. Refurbishment is extremely beneficial to those vehicles and produces one that is as attractive as a new one to passengers. The hon Gentleman must understand that Government support to British Rail is now at the highest level ever. In those circumstances, it is for British Rail to make the best use of its resources for carrying out improvements of the type for which he asks.	1982-12-01a.249.10	Is the Minister aware that many of those units, especially the ones on the Brighton line, are dilapidated and urgently need refurbishing? Is he further aware that the Swindon railway workshops were promised a 10-year rolling programme to refurbish the EMUs on the Brighton line but are now unable to do so because of restrictions on the external financing limit?

That is one way of bringing more investment and capital in to improve our railways, a way to which we should not close our minds.	1982-12-01a.252.7	Is my right hon Friend aware that previous Governments allowed British Rail to finance by leasing using private sector finance—for example, for its locomotive programme?

But too high a speed in bad road conditions will cause accidents.	1982-12-01a.253.4	Will the Minister accept, from one of those who hit the road works, that while roadworks are in progress on the M1 the motorway is far more dangerous than normal and that during the present season of fog and ice people should cease behaving like homicidal maniacs, thereby risking their own lives and others on the roads, not least the lives of hon Members going to and from their constituencies?	1982-12-01a.253.3	person/17916	person/16922	True	1982-12-01	thatcher	False	False	0	Transport	Transport	M1 (Accidents)	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

Often the most important factor is that drivers fail to reduce speed when conditions demand that they should.	1982-12-01a.253.6	I have frequently come across these roadworks, but have not hit them. Does the Minister accept that this is a matter of widespread concern among the travelling public? If there are no figures on the relationship between accidents and road works on motorways, is it not time that such figures were compiled?

1982-12-01.3.0	My hon Friend is right to draw attention to that. It is a matter of great concern. We all welcome the prospect of more investment in new equipment and rolling stock for British Rail, but it is essential that when the investment takes place the equipment is worked with proper manning levels and without restrictive practices. Until there is a change in the present situation, it is difficult to win public confidence and support for further improvement of the British Rail system and the investment that we all want.	1982-12-01a.254.1	I am grateful to my right hon Friend for that reply. Whatever conclusions he may reach, the sums involved will be very large. Will he ensure that there is no possibility of public money being wasted in the way that has occurred on the St. Pancras to Bedford line, where £150 million worth of rolling stock has lain idle for nearly a year due to union manning disputes?	1982-12-01a.254.0	person/17362	person/21726	True	1982-12-01	thatcher	False	False	0	Transport	Transport	British Rail	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1982-12-01.3.1	Yes, I agree with that. The HST programme has been particularly successful, although in some senses internationally underrated. The 125 mph high speed diesel trains are a remarkable railway achievement.	1982-12-01a.254.3	What conclusions does the Minister draw from the fact that on the London-Midland line, which serves the hon Member for Harborough (Mr. Farr) and me, revenues have dramatically increased since the belated introduction of high-speed trains between London and Sheffield? Does the Minister agree that such investment raises both morale and revenue, and that that is what we need, rather than carping and sniping at British Rail?	1982-12-01a.254.2	person/22082	person/21726	False	1982-12-01	thatcher	False	False	0	Transport	Transport	British Rail	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

I hope that the results of the Serpell committee inquiry will help to disentangle which parts of the railway are run for social reasons and which parts are or should be run commercially.	1982-12-01a.254.5	Will my right hon Friend confirm yet again that in terms of finance there are two railways—the one that British Rail is able and willing to run profitably, and the social railway that the nation demands? Does he agree that there are far too many questions about the British Rail subsidy and far too few about the subsidy for the M1 motorway, the cost of repairs, police, accidents and time lost?

1982-12-01.3.3	The hon Gentleman may not be aware that final agreement has not yet been secured. It is the subject of current negotiations. I am anxious that British Rail should be able to move forward on all the agreements that were signed in 1981 but have not yet been delivered. Those agreements are a precondition for the successful working of existing investment, let alone new investment.	1982-12-01a.254.7	Does the Secretary of State recall that during the industrial dispute earlier this year both he and the chairman of British Rail constantly said that if the railway unions accepted the productivity package it would result in investment in the railways?

1982-12-01.4.0	The hon Gentleman completely misrepresents the facts. I point out to him very firmly that since May 1979 revenue support to public transport has risen in cash and in real terms. I hope that he will go away and think seriously about that, as it shows what rubbish his question was.	1982-12-01a.255.2	How much of that increase is due to cuts in Government transport subsidy and cuts imposed by the Government on local authority transport subsidies? Is it not a classic example of Tory double standards when Ministers refuse to provide an adequate transport subsidy for the general public but approve a 100 per cent. transport subsidy for themselves so that they can travel around for nothing in the luxury of chauffeur-driven limousines?	1982-12-01a.255.1	person/10091	person/22094	True	1982-12-01	thatcher	False	False	0	Transport	Transport	Public Transport Fares	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1982-12-01.4.1	My hon Friend is absolutely right to emphasise the importance for the quality of life generally of efficient public transport. The way to get public transport fares under control is through higher productivity, worthwhile investment and responsible wage settlements. Throwing money away on irresponsible current subsidies makes it impossible to finance the investment that could cut costs and make the services more attractive.	1982-12-01a.255.4	Leaving aside all political implications, does my hon Friend appreciate the social consequences of the increase in fares? Is he aware that the price of a season ticket to London from Folkestone has risen fourfold since I have had the honour to be in the House? Does he realise that, as people used to commute from Folkestone to London, the increases mean that house prices in Folkestone have fallen while those in London have risen? Should that not be considered before further price increases are approved?	1982-12-01a.255.3	person/17054	person/22094	False	1982-12-01	thatcher	False	False	0	Transport	Transport	Public Transport Fares	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1982-12-01.4.2	As the hon Gentleman knows, it is for Essex county council to decide what support should be given to that line. The fact that fares in London have risen 40 per cent. more than the retail prices index makes one think very seriously about the policies of the GLC.	1982-12-01a.255.6	Is the Minister aware of the enormous increase in fares on the section of the Central line that runs through Essex, especially the Epping and Ongar section, because of the refusal of the Conservative-controlled Essex county council—unlike the Labour-controlled GLC—to claim transport supplementary grant to provide a subsidy for that line? Is he aware that all services on that line are to disappear, except for those in the rush hour? Will that not prove to be a recipe for the eventual closure of the line?

Is he aware that today London Transport announced that it suspects that it is losing £30 million through fraud? Would not the elimination of that fraud contribute to lower fares than the 40 per cent. increase to which he has referred?	1982-12-01a.255.7	person/18586	person/22094	False	1982-12-01	thatcher	False	False	0	Transport	Transport	Public Transport Fares	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

We are continually reviewing the way in which jobs are carried through to make the service more efficient. The VED system was examined in 1979 by the then Secretary of State for Transport, my right hon Friend the Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr. Fowler), and the Government decided not to abolish vehicle excise duty because of the effect on rural motorists and business users.	1982-12-01a.256.5	How many people are now employed at Swansea, particularly in dealing with vehicle excise duty?

As the gravest doubts are cast on those assurances by the hon Lady's answer to me, may we have a categorical assurance that if this transfer is not successfully negotiated there will be no transfer of the HGV testing to the private sector, and that in no circumstances will HGV testing be broken up and handed over to a series of private firms?"	1982-12-01a.256.9	person/21646	person/16922	True	1982-12-01	thatcher	False	False	0	Transport	Transport	Heavy Lorries (Testing)	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1982-12-01.7.0	As my answer will have shown the hon Gentleman, the investment ceiling is not one of those constraints. The answer to the hon Gentleman's question must lie in British Rail containing its operating costs and in generating the funds available for investment up to the substantial ceiling that I have outlined.	1982-12-01a.257.5	How much of that figure is available to British Rail for investment, because, increasingly, British Rail says that it is unable to meet the investment programme by reason of the constraints placed upon it by the Government?	1982-12-01a.257.4	person/22114	<UNKNOWN>	True	1982-12-01	thatcher	False	False	0	Transport	Transport	British Rail	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

The Transport Act 1980 opened up new opportunities for rural areas, which have been taken up gladly in many parts of the country.	1982-12-01a.259.5	Is not the low level of transport in rural areas, and generally, due to a lack of investment in transport by the Government, and is not the biggest restrictive practice in transport precisely that lack of proper investment by the Government? When this matter is examined on a world scale, is not the United Kingdom among the lowest on the international list? Is not the real reason for that the lack of proper rural transport?	1982-12-01a.259.4	person/22023	person/16922	False	1982-12-01	thatcher	False	False	0	Transport	Transport	Rural Transport	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1982-12-01.9.2	My hon Friend's proposals are attractive. Few bus companies can afford to run widely flung services in areas where there is insufficient demand for them to run with a sensible pricing system. We shall examine the results of any such experiment with great care. We believe that the money that we pay in subsidy, however it is paid, must be put to the best use for people who need to travel.	1982-12-01a.259.7	Is my hon Friend aware that in many rural areas, such as the one that I represent, fares on public transport are greater than those on private transport on the same routes? While that situation continues it is hardly surprising that many rural communities are not served by bus services, which are becoming increasingly unviable. Will my hon Friend encourage bus companies to experiment with cut-price fare schemes? If they cut their fares by 50 per cent., they may be surprised to find that use more than doubles and that such systems become feasible.	1982-12-01a.259.6	person/22553	person/16922	False	1982-12-01	thatcher	False	False	0	Transport	Transport	Rural Transport	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

1982-12-01.10.2	There is some good sense in the hon Gentleman's point. We are in favour of having fares as low as possible and public transport to being as good as possible. The essential requirements are a sensible level of subsidy, which we are providing, sensible levels of service, tailored to needs, and efficient operation to prevent subsidies being wasted. By following those principles the resources can be created to improve the services.	1982-12-01a.261.0	Would not one way to stimulate use be to provide different forms of public transport? For example, the Minister could increase British Rail's investment programme to enable it to switch from DMUs to rail buses, which are produced in my constituency.

One of the industry's great problems is to ensure that investment is related to achieving an effective return in improved services.	1982-12-01a.261.4	Does the Minister acknowledge that the continuous pursuit of a cheap fares policy by the South Yorkshire metropolitan authority has been accompanied by a higher level of investment in bus services than has occurred in authorities where high fares policies have been pursued?

We are down to 655,000 and are on target to achieve the reduction. Adjustments are being made to the numbers of civil servants to take account of different work loads.

I do not think that such matters are accountable to this House, which has been the position with all previous Cabinet Ministers who have used Dorneywood. I reiterate the point that the visitors book is the property of the trust. The hon Gentleman has confirmed his reputation in this House for being famously boring, as The Times has said.	2006-06-21c.1301.7	I do not understand the Deputy Prime Minister's reluctance to give us the information. Even the Prime Minister, who is not known for being straight with answers, tells us who has been to Chequers.

I think that those discussions have led to an improvement, and I look forward to further visits to China for further discussions.	2006-06-21c.1302.4	That was a very good answer. My friend carries a heavy responsibility for the UK's relationship with China, and I know that he met a high-level delegation from the National People's Congress last week.

2006-06-21.2.0	My hon Friend is entirely right. The third sector can play an important role in innovating and getting close to the user, which the public sector sometimes cannot. For Labour Members, the fact that we have increased public spending since 1997 to deliver improved public services is absolutely consistent with an increased role for the third sector in delivery. Using the third sector is not about Government abdicating their responsibilities to fund public services adequately.	2006-06-21c.1304.2	I welcome that answer, not least because we have some very good and active third sector and community organisations in Tameside and Stockport. However, does my hon Friend agree that it is essential that in working with the third sector, Government and councils make it clear that they will not abdicate their responsibilities to fund those services adequately, but, as in my constituency, work in partnership with the third sector to deliver those improved public services?	2006-06-21c.1304.1	person/11531	person/11545	True	2006-06-21	blair	True	False	0	Cabinet Office	Chancellor Of The Duchy Of Lancaster	Third Sector	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2006-06-21.2.1	The hon Lady raises an important point about the operation of the Criminal Records Bureau in relation to volunteers.

We are working with the CRB on streamlining the process for the voluntary sector and will continue to work on that in the coming months.	2006-06-21c.1304.4	Will the Minister look at the situation concerning voluntary and charitable organisations whereby a person who serves in different categories has to be checked with the Criminal Records Bureau on every single occasion?

2006-06-21.2.2	"I agree with my hon Friend about the role that campaigning organisations play. I hope that there can be consensus about this in the House. I was concerned to see the remarks by the right hon Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith) , who is not in the House today, and who said of Make Poverty History:
""My concern is that if everybody comes together for one movement you get only one concept prevailing and it locks out alternative thinking.""
In my view, Make Poverty History, as an umbrella group for the development movement, was incredibly effective and led to the massive strides that have been made in the past couple of years on debt and development."	2006-06-21c.1304.6	Does my hon Friend agree that it is important to listen to campaigning bodies such as Make Poverty History? Does he further agree that it was an absolute disgrace that last week, when we supported the Bill promoted by my right hon Friend the Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Mr. Clarke) on the practical application of making poverty history, the Scottish National party was not represented?	2006-06-21c.1304.5	person/12834	person/11545	False	2006-06-21	blair	True	False	0	Cabinet Office	Chancellor Of The Duchy Of Lancaster	Third Sector	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2006-06-21.2.3	"That was a long and complicated question. [Hon Members: ""Answer it.""] I will. The hon Gentleman says that the Conservative party is united behind Make Poverty History, but the man appointed to be in charge of social justice for the party said that it locked out alternative voices. That does not sound like unity behind Make Poverty History.
There has been a big growth in social enterprise in the past eight or nine years, partly because of what has been done. That includes the Phoenix fund, the support for community development finance institutions and the work of regional development agencies. Part of the role of the new office of the third sector is to bring together the work on social enterprise in one Department so that there is a further increase in social enterprise in the coming years."	2006-06-21c.1305.1	I am sure that the Minister will acknowledge that the Conservatives are very supportive of Make Poverty History. Will he acknowledge the role of social enterprise in tackling social exclusion, creating jobs, and delivering public services? Does he agree that there is a strong case for increasing the scale and scope of social enterprise by creating social enterprise zones? Will he look at ways of removing barriers to the expansion of the sector by simplifying often complex and fragmented funding flows by offering longer-term contracts and creating a more level playing field at the community level? How can any of that be achieved when eight Departments—according to research by my hon Friend the Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner) —do not monitor and refuse to keep central records of their contracts with the third sector?	2006-06-21c.1305.0	person/10267	person/11545	False	2006-06-21	blair	True	False	0	Cabinet Office	Chancellor Of The Duchy Of Lancaster	Third Sector	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2006-06-21.3.0	My hon Friend is right to draw attention to the role of worklessness in tackling child poverty. There are specific problems in South Tyneside—as he knows, I know the area well. I am working closely with my right hon Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions and my hon Friend the Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform so that we can work with people in South Tyneside—for example, employers and other partners—to get people into work and to sustain them in work, thus enabling them to lift themselves and their children out of poverty. Tackling worklessness and inactivity, especially among those on benefits, remains our top priority and we are determined to work on that so that all children, including those in South Tyneside, get the life chances that they deserve.	2006-06-21c.1306.0	We always rightly argue that the best pathway out of poverty is work. Yet, in South Tyneside, four out of 10 children have no parent in work.

""The package of support for low-income working families with children is now one of the most generous in the world.""
That has been critical to tackling the problem. The hon Gentleman also knows that tax credits benefit 6 million families with 10 million children. In total, 20 million people live in households that benefit from tax credits. Of course we want to do better. I look forward to his working with us to ensure that we can eliminate child poverty."	2006-06-21c.1306.2	I am glad to hear that the Minister is not satisfied with the Government's record—she has considerable reason not to be. The Government have already missed their target for cutting child poverty and there is not one hon Member who has not experienced cases in their surgery of poor families who are hit by demands for thousands of pounds because of Government failures in the tax credit system, which place people in extreme poverty.

2006-06-21.3.2	My hon Friend is absolutely right. Child care provision under this Government has increased substantially, and we have put in place a framework to enable access to child care for every family throughout the country. The Sure Start programme has played an important part in achieving that. We particularly want to enable lone parents to get back into work, and, as my hon Friend the Member for Jarrow (Mr. Hepburn) highlighted, worklessness is a particular problem for lone parents. So we will continue the drive to increase the opportunities for the children of lone parents, and child care is part of that package.	2006-06-21c.1306.4	Does my right hon Friend agree that the provision of adequate and affordable child care is a key issue, and that its absence is a possible barrier to parents moving into work? Although there has been a substantial increase in such child care under this Government, will she work with the Department for Education and Skills to ensure that its provision continues to improve and increase, so that that barrier can be removed?	2006-06-21c.1306.3	person/11943	person/10014	False	2006-06-21	blair	True	False	0	Cabinet Office	Chancellor Of The Duchy Of Lancaster	Social Exclusion	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

The right hon Gentleman made a point about taking over homes, and the Department has just made an announcement on that issue. It involves houses that have been empty for years. We are attempting to improve the streets, but in some cases we do not know who owns the house in question. In other cases, the owners have refused to improve the property. We have now decided to take over the management of such houses, improve them and bring them up to the standards that we want for those homes. They will then become available to the owners if they wish to take them back. The payment for the improvements will come from the rents that we will impose on them. This is about the management of those properties, not their takeover, and it will improve the areas that we are talking about.
As for the right hon Gentleman's point about the politically dead, perhaps now that he has been confirmed as the senior member of the shadow Cabinet, he will remove from his website the statement that he is still the leader of the Conservative party. Perhaps he will also tell us how successful he will be in getting an agreement for his party to come out of the European People's party, a job that he has been given but has so far failed to achieve."	2006-06-21c.1307.8	"Will the Deputy Prime Minister remind us who said:

I am pleased to see that former Vice-President Gore is in the UK and I am looking forward to meeting him tomorrow so that I can proudly tell him how the Government have not only met the Kyoto target established then, but at twice the level, which is quite an achievement. We need to talk more about the post-Kyoto agreements and I believe that every Government Department has more to do in order to achieve the target that we set for ourselves—a 60 per cent. reduction on 1990 levels by 2050. I shall be calling the Departments together and we have already had our first meeting with the Secretaries of State to see how Departments can do more to achieve those targets. Also on the agenda is reaching agreement on the EU emissions trading scheme, which has to be decided by next week.	2006-06-21c.1308.4	I thank my right hon Friend for that answer, but I am also aware that he is the lead negotiator on Kyoto, so what is he doing to ensure that Government Departments are complying with the Kyoto agreement and doing all they can to address issues of climate change?	2006-06-21c.1308.3	person/10150	person/10488	True	2006-06-21	blair	True	False	0	Deputy Prime Minister	Deputy Prime Minister	Policy Development	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

My hon Friend will be aware that the European Court is due to rule on an important case—the Cadman case—relating to the issue of whether the length of service in pay scales discriminates against women. The judgment will have significant consequences for Departments and we recently held discussions in the Cabinet Committee to find the best way forward. The Equal Pay Act was passed in 1970, but much remains to be done and the Cabinet Committee is working to achieve it.	2006-06-21c.1309.4	I thank the Deputy Prime Minister for that answer.

The amount of time that people are spending in prison is longer, but when there is justifiable concern about sentencing, it would be very odd if we as politicians did not raise it.	2006-06-21c.1310.9	Would the Prime Minister add to his engagements a prison visit to respond to the criticism of Lord Ramsbotham, the former chief inspector of prisons, who said that for the Prime Minister to demand more and longer custodial sentences is incoherent when prisons are chronically overcrowded and prisoners are being released prematurely, and to heed Lord Ramsbotham's advice that the best contribution that the Prime Minister can make to the sentencing process is, in his words, to shut up?	2006-06-21c.1310.8	person/10084	person/10047	True	2006-06-21	blair	True	False	0	Prime Minister	Prime Minister	Engagements	0	liberal-democrat	False	False	labour	True	False
2006-06-21.8.1	We are doing a number of things. First, obviously, we have introduced family-friendly policy that has allowed paternity leave for the first time, that has expanded maternity pay and that has expanded maternity leave. There are, of course, also extra places in nursery provision and in child care. And, of course, there are the Sure Start places. I want to make it clear that Labour Members are fully in favour of Sure Start—we believe that it does an excellent job—and I hope very much that the right hon Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) will withdraw his criticism of the Wythenshawe Sure Start, which I also believe is doing a superb job for its local community.	2006-06-21c.1311.0	Most people feel that fathers need to play a greater role in bringing up their children.

Those difficulties can be overcome, and we are perfectly happy to work with the right hon Gentleman and other hon Members to get the legislation through the House as quickly as possible.	2006-06-21c.1311.2	Two weeks ago, I asked the Prime Minister whether he would back Conservative proposals for tougher sentences for knife crime. He said that there were difficult issues. This week, the Home Secretary announced that he would work with us to strengthen the law.

Denmark is one of the countries that have introduced the packs, where they have been immensely successful. We are giving them a dry run this year, and they will be introduced fully next year. He is absolutely right as well about the energy saving requirements that will be part of the pack. This country is introducing that information some two years earlier than the European directive stipulates.	2006-06-21c.1314.1	Does my right hon Friend welcome last week's introduction of environmental performance certificates for domestic dwellings? They will ensure, for the first time, that people buying a home will have the same information about its environmental performance as they would have about a fridge that they wanted to buy. Does he regret the opposition to the introduction of home information packs, of which the certificates will form a key part, because that opposition ignores the packs' impact on the environment and because the HIP will be the most efficient way to get EPCs in front of consumers?	2006-06-21c.1314.0	person/11346	person/10047	False	2006-06-21	blair	True	False	0	Prime Minister	Prime Minister	Engagements	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

That is extremely important because otherwise many thousands of people would suffer unnecessarily. Along with what we have done for miners' compensation over many years, that is an indication that we recognise that there are people in this country who have worked very hard and suffered grave and debilitating illnesses as a result. It is right that we stand by them and protect them.	2006-06-21c.1315.10	What can my right hon Friend say to sufferers of mesothelioma and their families in my constituency and elsewhere, in view of the devastating message that they received from the Lords recently?	2006-06-21c.1315.9	person/11692	person/10047	False	2006-06-21	blair	True	False	0	Prime Minister	Prime Minister	Engagements	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

2006-06-21.8.11	It is important that we continue to support some of the poorest families; as a result of the policies, for example, in relation to child tax credit, hundreds of thousands of the poorest families receive that help and protection. I very much hope that we continue to give support through the children's tax credit. I think that I am right in saying that something like 3 million of the 7 million poorest families actually pay no income tax at all as a result of the help that we are giving them. In our judgment, that is the right way to help some of the poorest families to cope with their difficulties. What my hon Friend says in relation to the Conservative and Lib Dem-controlled council does not surprise me at all; they do that in many other places.	2006-06-21c.1316.3	Is my right hon Friend aware that Liberal and Tory-controlled Luton council is ending school uniform grants, thus hitting the poorest families hardest?

I am very sorry, but if he wants to raise these issues, he will get that reply.	2006-06-21c.1316.7	The Prime Minister yet again tried to sound terribly tough earlier, but let us look at his performance.

2006-06-21.8.13	My hon Friend is absolutely right both in what she says and the tone in which she says it. I am sure that everybody condemns what was an appalling and totally unjustifiable attack. In fairness to the football fans from England, as well, the vast majority of them behave extremely well. The way in which the present World cup is being conducted is absolutely excellent and it is a great tribute not just to the German authorities, who are conducting it and in charge of it, but to the English fans who have travelled there. I pay tribute to all those who lawfully and properly are football supporters. She is absolutely right in what she says about that particular case.	2006-06-21c.1317.1	Will my right hon Friend join me and the vast majority of Scottish people in condemning the wanton violence perpetrated on my constituent, Ian Smith, in Aberdeen yesterday, just for wearing an English top and flying a small English flag on his car?

2006-06-21.8.14	No, it is not, and I am sorry that the right hon and learned Gentleman says that, because I know that he supported the presence of British troops, and I say this in no disrespect to him at all. The fact is, at long last, we have for the first time ever in Iraq a fully elected democratic Government bringing together the Sunni, the Shi'a and the Kurds. They are the people who are the democratic representatives of the Iraqis today. Their view—all of them, incidentally, said this to me when I was in Baghdad recently—is that they want us to stay and see the job done, because there is difficulty in Iraq today not because the British authorities have fallen down on the job, or even, frankly, the Iraqi authorities, but because there are people there who want to terrorise and to stop democracy taking root for some of the same sorts of reasons that see those people engaged in criminal or terrorist acts the world over. We have to understand that the fight there, as in Afghanistan, is part of the wider struggle against that type of global terrorism. The worst message that we could send—I say this with respect to the right hon and learned Gentleman—is that we are going to walk away when the people who are democratically elected want us to stay. We stay and get the job done, and I believe that that is the British way.	2006-06-21c.1317.3	Given the tremendous work of reconstruction carried out by our brave troops in Iraq over the past three years, but given also the fact that there is a fast-diminishing prospect of further positive achievement in the face of the growing sectarian violence in that country, is it not time now, with honour and dignity and pride, to bring our troops home?	2006-06-21c.1317.2	person/10010	person/10047	False	2006-06-21	blair	True	False	0	Prime Minister	Prime Minister	Engagements	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False

2006-06-21.8.16	I can only look into that particular case, because obviously I do not know about it. There can be reasons why people are not immediately deported that are to do with the country to which they are being returned. It is quite important that before we take it as read that a person immediately goes once there is a deportation order, we realise that there can sometimes be reasons why they are not returned immediately that have nothing to do with the immigration authorities or the Home Office. The important thing is that such people should be in custody until the moment at which they can be returned.	2006-06-21c.1318.3	A month ago, I wrote to the Home Secretary—so far I have not had a reply—about a foreign prisoner who should have been deported in February, at the end of his sentence. In fact, he was deported on 11 June . That delay has cost the taxpayer £20,800. Given that the Home Office has told me that there are 450 others in immigration detention who have finished their sentences, may I ask the Prime Minister whether he will ensure that they are deported more quickly and at less cost to the taxpayer?	2006-06-21c.1318.2	person/11791	person/10047	False	2006-06-21	blair	True	False	0	Prime Minister	Prime Minister	Engagements	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2006-06-21.8.17	Actually, the Chancellor announced that we are putting significant sums into microgeneration. I cannot remember the exact amount, but we are spending somewhere in the region of several hundred million pounds on research into renewable energy. My hon Friend is quite right about the interesting things that are happening in other countries, as is the case here. When the energy review is published, he will see that as well as dealing with the difficult issue of nuclear power, there will be a great emphasis on energy efficiency and renewable energy. The frank and brutal truth is that we will have to act through a whole range of measures to ensure that we can both guarantee energy supplies and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.	2006-06-21c.1318.5	In Berlin, 80 per cent. of the new buildings that are going up are generating their own energy. In the Netherlands, energy is generated from motorways, schools, health centres and even car parks. A whole eco city is being built in China, but in the UK, not one of our major spending Departments, with the exception of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, is investing in energy self-generation. Given the Prime Minister's commitment to the climate change issue, will he get his civil servants to look at generating some energy about generating their own energy?	2006-06-21c.1318.4	person/10541	person/10047	False	2006-06-21	blair	True	False	0	Prime Minister	Prime Minister	Engagements	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2006-06-21.8.18	First, I entirely agree with what the hon Gentleman says about what was obviously a shocking crime. I agree that we are providing more prison places precisely because those who need to be in prison should be in prison. However, I point out that as a result of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, such people can now be given indeterminate sentences, in which case they are not automatically paroled, but released only when they are no longer a danger to the community. It was precisely because of cases such as the one that he mentioned that we introduced the provision, and I think that I am right in saying that almost 1,000 people have been subject to it.	2006-06-21c.1319.0	Stephen Ayre was a convicted murderer who was released early and went on to abduct and rape a 10-year-old boy in my constituency. Does the Prime Minister agree with me that the way to tackle overcrowding in prisons is not to release dangerous people out on to our streets early, but to build more prisons so that prisoners can serve their sentences in full?	2006-06-21c.1318.6	person/11816	person/10047	False	2006-06-21	blair	True	False	0	Prime Minister	Prime Minister	Engagements	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False

It used to be the case that the average asylum application— [ Interruption. ] I am explaining what we have done in nine years, so the right hon Gentleman should listen.
An asylum application used to take 20 months, but the average time in the vast majority of cases is now two months. We used to remove only one in five failed asylum seekers, but we now remove more than the number of unfounded applications that come in. Unlike the previous Government, who were about to sack people from the immigration department, we have increased the numbers to deal with the situation. That is what we have done in nine years, and we will do more over the next nine."	2006-06-21c.1319.4	Why has it taken the Prime Minister nine years in office to decide to review the problems with the workings of the Home Office?	2006-06-21c.1319.3	person/10391	person/10047	False	2006-06-21	blair	True	False	0	Prime Minister	Prime Minister	Engagements	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False

My hon Friend talked about members of the private or independent sector coming into Downing street. They came to a meeting with chief executives of NHS hospital trusts to discuss how, on things like procurement, the NHS sector could learn from the independent sector. The people who spoke up for that type of partnership and engagement were not actually the politicians; it was the people working in the NHS. I think that where we can get the right partnership between the independent and voluntary sector and the public sector, we should have it, but it is all according to one principle, which is NHS care free at the point of use."	2006-06-21c.1320.1	On Monday last week, my right hon Friend met the leaders of big corporations such as Tesco and Sainsbury to encourage them to join the boards of foundation hospitals.

Even if research from America tells us that class sizes of 13 or 15 are desirable, research from America and from here tells us that interventions that impact on teaching methods rather than on class size offer better results and better value for money. The hon Gentleman will be aware that class sizes have edged up a little over the past two years and standards have risen a great deal.	1995-06-27a.669.12	In fact, I asked about class sizes. Why do the Government insist on the nonsense that class sizes do not matter? It goes against common sense. Has the Secretary of State seen the report published a couple of weeks ago by the National Commission on Education, which draws attention to the importance of class size in primary and, particularly, infant schools? Has she seen the research carried out in Tennessee, whereby a comparison of a class of 15 pupils with a class of 25 pupils shows that higher standards are achieved and pupils behave better in smaller classes?

We shall have more information from the Office for Standards in Education database. At present, I do not see a case for more long-term research on class sizes as such, but I see every reason for having useful research that can improve standards.	1995-06-27a.670.2	Will the Secretary of State now answer the question on commissioning research? Is it not a disgrace that we must depend on American research like the Tennessee Star project and the Ypsilanti project on nursery education?

Our circular makes it clear that schools should look imaginatively at every way in which they can get the message about drugs across to young vulnerable people. That will include using teachers in their authoritative positions and anyone from outside a school whom the school considers to be appropriate for its pupils to listen to and be guided by. We want to leave as much of the strategy as possible to the schools to decide, within the framework and the guidance that we have offered them in support. I am confident that that will happen.	1995-06-27a.671.3	Young people hear of drugs from a frighteningly young age, so I welcome my hon Friend's initiative. Does he agree that it is not just what is taught that is important but who teaches it?

1995-06-27.3.0	"The hon Member will know that my remit does not extend to the schools in Northern

Ireland, but I may say from this Dispatch Box, without risking too much, that, first, I shall relay his comments to my right hon and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. I understand that those comments arise from a consultation paper that my right hon and learned Friend has issued for discussion. Secondly, I also understand that the aim of the specific proposal to which the hon Gentleman referred is to simplify school funding and not to extend local authority control over schools. Voluntary grammar schools will continue to he self-governing and there is no intention of changing their autonomy in that respect."	1995-06-27a.671.8	Does the Minister share the concern of the people of Northern Ireland, particularly in my constituency, that the boon of praise that the Government give for those schools that have opted out has obviously not been shared in Northern Ireland, where it is now apparently policy for grammar schools to report to the education boards when hitherto they reported to the Department of Education? Is this a seamless Government or are we witnessing a different way of governing Northern Ireland, against the wishes of the people of Northern Ireland?	1995-06-27a.671.7	person/10553	person/22600	True	1995-06-27	major	False	False	0	Education	Education	Secondary Schools	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1995-06-27.3.1	My hon Friend makes an excellent point. One of the many curious aspects of the policy document that appeared from the Opposition last week was that it tried to justify how, if 10 per cent. of the funding of existing, successful grant-maintained schools was taken away, those schools would still be as effective and efficient as they are at present.	1995-06-27a.672.1	Will my hon Friend, however, bear it in mind that if we manage to achieve extra funds for education in the forthcoming year, many Conservative Members will want to make sure that the money goes straight to schools and not to local education authorities to do with as they will? Will he look seriously at any proposal for extra cash to ensure that it goes direct to schools?	1995-06-27a.672.0	person/10397	person/22600	False	1995-06-27	major	False	False	0	Education	Education	Secondary Schools	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1995-06-27.3.2	The practical reason why relatively few schools have opted out in the past 12 months compared with the previous 12 months is that more than nine out of 10 governing bodies have still refused to give parents the opportunity to vote. If I may extrapolate from that why that should be so, the reason is that Labour Members and councillors and Labour-controlled councils up and down the country are still utterly opposed to grant-maintained schools, notwithstanding the sweet words that we have heard from the Labour Front Bench.	1995-06-27a.672.3	As the Member with probably the country's largest opted-out secondary school in his constituency, with more than 2,000 pupils, may I ask why the Minister thinks that so few schools—he gave a figure of 400—have opted out in the past three years? How many of those have opted out in the past 12 months?	1995-06-27a.672.2	person/10511	person/22600	False	1995-06-27	major	False	False	0	Education	Education	Secondary Schools	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1995-06-27.3.3	I readily reassure my right hon Friend in that respect. I saw nothing in the past seven days, and I do not suppose that my right hon Friend did, to persuade us that there was a better way of treating grant-maintained schools than the one that we have established. All the Labour party tried, and failed, to do was to reconcile the preferences of a number of leading Labour politicians with the utter hatred that so many of them have for self-government.	1995-06-27a.672.5	Will my hon Friend take this opportunity, following his last answer, to reaffirm that the Government will follow the climate of the Education Reform Act 1988 for grant-maintained schools, maintain exactly the same circumstances in which schools can opt out and tell the country very clearly that the gobbledegook that has come from the Labour party recently on grant-maintained schools is not acceptable to a Conservative Government?	1995-06-27a.672.4	person/17391	person/22600	False	1995-06-27	major	False	False	0	Education	Education	Secondary Schools	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1995-06-27.4.0	No, I would not agree with the hon Gentleman on the essence of his question. The capital guidelines for the current year—the total amount that the Government approve for capital spending by local authorities—was increased in cash terms by 3.5 per cent. The priorities were drawn up a decade ago in discussion with local authorities. I have made it clear that I am happy to revisit those priorities, but the hon Gentleman would not expect his authority to be treated differently from the rest. The priorities will, logically, continue to be existing projects, meeting basic need, and the removal of surplus places.	1995-06-27a.673.3	Does the Minister agree that, in my borough and across London, resources are being reduced at a time when the number of schoolchildren in London is increasing faster than the national average? Does he agree that the system for determining education annual capital guidelines needs investigating to ensure that resources are directed to where they are most needed?	1995-06-27a.673.2	person/10337	person/22600	True	1995-06-27	major	False	False	0	Education	Education	Capital Works, Ealing	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1995-06-27.4.1	My hon Friend does well to remind us of the great discretion that local education authorities enjoy over how they spend their money, but the example of my hon Friend's Labour-run authority is a very bad one. My hon Friend also reminds me that the Government's borrowing approvals are but a part of the total capital spending. Indeed, in the most recent full year for which I have figures—1993–94—they represented only 50 per cent. of the total amount spent on our schools.	1995-06-27a.673.5	I thank my hon Friend for the good work at Cardinal Wiseman high school. All the money will be well spent there. Ealing Labour council has £17 million in reserves, yet it has the effrontery to cut teachers' jobs—it is seeking to cut three at Northolt primary school which should be restored immediately. It has no right to deprive children of a proper education by taking away teachers' jobs or money from schools; there is plenty in the bank and Ealing Labour council had better put it back into schools straight away.	1995-06-27a.673.4	person/22587	person/22600	False	1995-06-27	major	False	False	0	Education	Education	Capital Works, Ealing	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1995-06-27.5.0	I hope that the hon Gentleman is not articulating any hostility towards selection, the assisted places scheme or, indeed, independent schools. His Front-Bench team has performed at least half a dozen U-turns on education policy since the beginning of the year. Last week, we were given to understand that it was paying lip service to diversity in education—although the small print revealed that it was not. Next month, the hon Gentleman might find that his Front-Bench team has left him in the lurch—and that is not a very comfortable place to be.	1995-06-27a.674.2	Nought out of 10, I am afraid. Would the Secretary of State care to read the question again and try to do better next time? I am seeking to make the serious point that none of the appraisals of the assisted places scheme has concentrated on the effect on feeder schools of having their brightest pupils creamed off. Such schools lose those pupils who give an example to others and who take the lead and set the pace. If we are to make a proper appraisal of the scheme, is it not essential that we consider the effect of creaming off those pupils?	1995-06-27a.674.1	person/10203	person/10536	True	1995-06-27	major	False	False	0	Education	Education	Assisted Places Scheme	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1995-06-27.5.1	My hon Friend is, of course, right. The whole point of the assisted places scheme is that it offers choice and opportunity to able children from less well-off families, and what a pity it is that at this stage, and this month, Opposition Members do not seem to be in favour of it.	1995-06-27a.674.4	Surely my right hon Friend the Secretary of State will agree that whether a school is full of SAT—standard assessment task—level 8 or SAT level 2 children should make no difference to the quality of the school. As the purpose of teaching is to bring the best out of every child, it should make no difference to a school, although it may make a difference to the individual child. Should not every teacher concentrate on each child's potential, regardless of the level that each child is innately able to reach?	1995-06-27a.674.3	person/22646	person/10536	False	1995-06-27	major	False	False	0	Education	Education	Assisted Places Scheme	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

It is clearly best to take one carefully planned step at a time.	1995-06-27a.674.9	Is it not an absolute disgrace that, almost 25 years after Baroness Thatcher pledged that every three and four-year old should have a nursery place if the parents wanted it, the Government have not delivered on that pledge? Why have the Government got it in for three-year-olds?	1995-06-27a.674.8	person/10487	person/10536	True	1995-06-27	major	False	False	0	Education	Education	Nursery Education	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1995-06-27.6.1	I thank my hon Friend. I am currently putting the finishing touches on the policy and I shall make a full announcement to the House in the next couple of weeks. I have always made it clear that early education is very important. We shall base our policy on maximum choice for parents between the maintained and the private and voluntary sectors. We shall ensure that, whatever delivery mechanism is used, it will not crowd out the private and voluntary sectors. We shall also make sure that the scheme is practical and of good quality and that it will work successfully.	1995-06-27a.675.1	The hon Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice) appears to forget that the Labour party was in power between 1974 and 1979. Having been in local government, and having been the deputy chairman of an education authority, may I tell my right hon Friend that I accept that the education received by a young child—boy or girl—at the nursery stage will undoubtedly affect that child's career, ultimately, and his ability to do well in his subsequent years in education? Will my right hon Friend take it from me that we warmly welcome the Prime Minister's commitment to nursery education?	1995-06-27a.675.0	person/10647	person/10536	False	1995-06-27	major	False	False	0	Education	Education	Nursery Education	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1995-06-27.6.2	Dear me, the hon Gentleman can do better than that. I have said frequently from this Dispatch Box and elsewhere that the delivery mechanism would have to provide choice for parents and that nothing was ruled in and nothing was ruled out. However, I can confirm that putting buying power and choice in the hands of parents will be a key feature of the scheme and that, therefore, vouchers will be part of it.	1995-06-27a.675.3	Further to the Secretary of State's answer, will she confirm that, in respect of the delivery of expanded nursery education, she has said frequently that the use of vouchers would be unnecessarily complicated and bureaucratic? Will she also acknowledge that the Prime Minister clearly overruled her in his statement on Saturday? Does she believe that that stems from complete ignorance, stupidity, or the unacceptable slap of firm leadership?	1995-06-27a.675.2	person/10208	person/10536	False	1995-06-27	major	False	False	0	Education	Education	Nursery Education	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1995-06-27.6.3	Yes. I can confirm that the scheme will certainly not crowd out the important voluntary sector, and I have also mentioned the private sector. The work of the pre-school playgroup movement has been invaluable to the learning experience of millions of children. It is interesting that the movement has rechristened itself the Pre-School Learning Alliance, which I think signifies the importance that it places on the education that it provides.	1995-06-27a.675.5	Will my right hon Friend confirm that the steady advance of nursery education is not intended to be at the expense of the pre-school playgroup movement, which has received considerable support from the Government?	1995-06-27a.675.4	person/10263	person/10536	False	1995-06-27	major	False	False	0	Education	Education	Nursery Education	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

I wonder whether the hon Gentleman read that."	1995-06-27a.676.0	"The Secretary of State may have read in this morning's papers about the right hon Member for Kingston upon Thames (Mr. Lamont) and the fact that Mr. Spock and the occupants of Planet Vulcan do not believe in nursery education at all. On Saturday, the Prime Minister emeritus told us that there was a new definition of nursery provision which included any place for any child. Although we support pre-school and other provision, does the Secretary of State agree that, in defending herself against the onset of vouchers, she must

also make it absolutely clear—so that she is not left uncomfortably in the lurch—that she still believes in nursery places for four-year-olds and that she believes in places for every four-year-old, not just those whose parents who can afford to top up a voucher or travel a long way to a place?"	1995-06-27a.675.6	person/10050	person/10536	False	1995-06-27	major	False	False	0	Education	Education	Nursery Education	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1995-06-27.7.0	Yes. My hon Friend is absolutely right. I was perplexed—nay, shocked—at what I learnt about Somerset. It does seem to me to be perverse, to say the least, although not surprising, that the Liberal Democrats should so casually go back on their promise. I hope that my hon Friend and his constituents will press very hard indeed for an explanation from the authority as to why it is playing politics with children's education, and then seek to pressure that authority to use the increased money available to it to better education in the way that I am sure that all his constituents and other people in Somerset expected.	1995-06-27a.676.5	Despite the result of Somerset's appeal, is my hon Friend aware that there are still to be 35 compulsory redundancies in schools in Somerset or thereabouts'? Does he realise that that runs counter to a pledge that was given by the Liberal Democrat leader of Somerset county council, that the £4 million agreed package with local Members of Parliament would obviate the need for such redundancies'? Does that not show that Liberal Democrats, as always, do not honour their commitments, do not stand by their pledges and are not prepared to put Somerset's children first?	1995-06-27a.676.4	person/22628	person/10206	True	1995-06-27	major	False	False	0	Education	Education	School Standards	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1995-06-27.8.0	If I can bring the hon Gentleman back to education matters for a moment, I should like to say that he starts off from an interesting position in criticising education funding, as his own authority had an increase of 4.6 per cent. this year, which is the type of increase that most of his hon Friends, and certainly most of my hon Friends, would have welcomed. However, it is not a question of jam tomorrow, as he puts it. We shall increase spending on education as the economy continues to improve, but we have increased spending until now. As the hon Gentleman will know if he is reminded, since we came to office spending per pupil has increased by about 50 per cent. and spending per pupil on repairs and maintenance has increased by about 15 per cent. in real terms.	1995-06-27a.677.0	"Can the Secretary of State explain why education authorities, parents or schools should believe her protestation of jam tomorrow, in the light of their


experience this year and in all the previous years? If it is because the Prime Minister has committed himself to that, can she be certain that he is telling her the truth, any more than the right hon Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) told her the truth last Friday about his intentions for the leadership of the Conservative party?"	1995-06-27a.676.9	person/10176	person/22600	True	1995-06-27	major	False	False	0	Education	Education	Education Authority Budgets	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1995-06-27.8.1	My hon Friend is right to highlight not only the possibility of a new funding formula—the Education Select Committee, which he chairs, as I said at a previous Question Time, is doing sterling work on that aspect—but the fact that every local education scheme has its own local management of schools scheme. There are 109 different schemes, and within those schemes there is significant scope for education authorities to reflect the different needs of the schools that remain under their control.	1995-06-27a.677.2	I draw my hon Friend's attention to the growing debate about national funding for education that is taking place. May I ask him to draw attention, in any deliberations that are taking place and any negotiations that he has with local education authorities, to the vagaries of the local formulae and the perverse effects that they can have on many schools in the same local education authority area?	1995-06-27a.677.1	person/22604	person/22600	False	1995-06-27	major	False	False	0	Education	Education	Education Authority Budgets	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

1995-06-27.9.0	We will always discharge our duty, and the Secretary of State in particular is anxious to protect vulnerable pupils from the depredations of local authorities wherever possible. I emphasise that great discretion is given to local education authorities in determining transport arrangements for pupils in their charge. If people decide in a local election to change the complexion of their local authority, it should not surprise them too much if a vindictive authority controlled by the Labour or Liberal party chooses to wreak cheap vengeance on the pupils in its care.	1995-06-27a.678.2	My hon Friend will be aware that with nearly 31,000 grammar school children in Kent—about one third of all children being educated in Kent—we are particularly anxious about the kind of story coming out of Essex, where a Labour-controlled council has denied free transport to grammar school children.

How they interpret that duty must remain a matter for them.	1995-06-27a.681.7	Does the Minister accept that, to a large extent, many further education colleges depend on their students receiving discretionary awards? In recent years, many of those colleges have seen the number of students attracting discretionary awards reduce quite substantially.

He will know that the Police Complaints Authority is supervising an investigation into complaints made about the police in the course of the riots and I think that the hon Gentleman also agreed on a previous occasion that that is an independent inquiry and can be expected to do a thorough job.

If those resolutions, which call for devastating defence cuts, were ever to be translated into political reality, they would mean the disappearance of at least a quarter of our armed forces and the redundancy of at least 100,000 workers in defence industries. Only this Government have a strong and credible policy for Britain's defences.	1992-10-27a.852.7	I know that my hon Friend does not need to be reminded yet again by me of the importance of defence expenditure to Portsmouth, so can he assure me that he will continue to remind the public as well as the defence industry that any alternative policy is one of swingeing cuts in defence expenditure, such as was proposed and passed yet again at the Labour party conference this year, that the Liberals are little better and that that policy is very much against the defence interests of this country?	1992-10-27a.852.6	person/22644	person/16443	True	1992-10-27	major	False	False	0	Defence	Defence	Defence Equipment	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

I take considerable encouragement from the results that have been produced.	1992-10-27a.853.2	My hon Friend will be aware that the German Defence Minister came to this country not many weeks ago to discuss the future of the EFA programme.

1992-10-27.3.3	I do not accept the hon Gentleman's breakdown of the figures. My impression, without being able to check the figures, is that a much more substantial percentage of British defence spending goes to key aircraft factories, particularly in the north-west of England. I do not think that the imbalance is anything like as bad as he suggests. There is no regional policy in defence spending. We place our contracts on the basis of value for money and obtaining the best products at the best prices.	1992-10-27a.853.4	Does the Minister accept that the expenditure to which he referred, which will generate 350,000 jobs and £9,000 million worth of expenditure, will have a considerable economic effect? Is he aware that more than 50 per cent. of that expenditure will be made in south-east England, but less than 2 per cent. in Wales?

We have the advantage that if we locate the new office in a place where we already have an office, we shall have a core of workers who will help to establish the new, much bigger collocated offices. No decisions have yet been taken and we shall consider all locations around the country.	1992-10-27a.855.1	When the Minister takes his decision, will he give due weight to the fact that already this year it has been announced that 1,200 Ministry of Defence civilian jobs in Harrogate will go, while 250 civilian jobs at the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers' workshop at Strensall have also gone? The losses come on top of a reduction from 9,500 to 5,500 in the number of Ministry of Defence civilian jobs in Yorkshire in the past decade. Does the Minister accept that a decision to lose further civilian jobs at York will be met by anger and disbelief in a city with a proud military tradition and in a county that has contributed so much to the military over the centuries?	1992-10-27a.855.0	person/10029	person/10255	True	1992-10-27	major	False	False	0	Defence	Defence	Army Manning And Record Offices	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

Many people who have served the Ministry of Defence and the armed forces well over many years are pinning their hopes on the relocation of the integrated personnel centre to the York area. If York is good enough as a centre for the Department for Education, for the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and for many other commercial firms, it should be good enough for the Ministry of Defence.	1992-10-27a.855.2	person/10242	person/10255	False	1992-10-27	major	False	False	0	Defence	Defence	Army Manning And Record Offices	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

Of course, we taken into account the local conditions of unemployment, because that improves our chances of recruiting people locally to man the offices. There are many different considerations in the process. Once we come to a proposal, we put it to the trade unions. There is always a consultation period during which the trade unions can put forward their ideas about how they see us going forward.	1992-10-27a.855.5	What criteria does the Minister use when he makes such decisions?

The United Kingdom and many other countries are performing a far more enhanced role in contributing towards helping to deal with countries with significant problems of instability or internal strife.	1992-10-27a.856.1	Does my right hon and learned Friend agree that this is a further and very welcome example of the commitment of the United Nations throughout the world to achieving a major peacekeeping role?	1992-10-27a.856.0	person/22351	person/11660	True	1992-10-27	major	False	False	0	Defence	Defence	Cambodia	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

We are using our married quarters for that purpose.	1992-10-27a.856.6	Is my right hon Friend aware that many local authorities, including South Cambridgeshire district council, do not believe that having been resident in married quarters in a district is sufficient contact with the area for the people concerned to be accepted on to the housing waiting list? As a result, when service men are being made redundant from bases in my constituency, they find themselves with nowhere to go. Will my right hon Friend look again at the housing position, especially bearing in mind the fact that many of the bases have many vacant quarters on them, and find a way forward so we can ensure that service men who are being made redundant, many of whom have served in the Gulf, are not left homeless without anywhere to go?	1992-10-27a.856.5	person/10470	person/10255	True	1992-10-27	major	False	False	0	Defence	Defence	Ex-Service Men (Housing)	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1992-10-27.7.1	We already make married quarters available for service men to buy at discounted prices. We are also making it possible for service men to part-purchase private properties and pay rent on the remainder. We are also reaching deals with housing associations, and are negotiating the transfer to housing associations of some 1,100 married quarters. We would keep a number of the allocations of those premises for ex-service men or service men who were about to leave. We have addressed the problem, and a lot of effort is being put into it.	1992-10-27a.857.0	Is the Minister aware that, compared with the figure for the United Kingdom as a whole, a very large proportion of the Scottish population is involved in the armed forces, and that the problem of demobbed service men is therefore a serious one? My hon Friend the Member for Motherwell, North (Dr. Reid) and I had a meeting with representatives of the CO Scottish Command at Glencorse barracks in my constituency, who proposed the formation of an organisation that could be funded by the Government to buy houses and take over Ministry of defence properties to provide rented accommodation for service men which they could eventually purchase. That could be a way forward. As those representatives said to us, the present demand for houses is only the tip of the iceberg.	1992-10-27a.856.7	person/10114	person/10255	False	1992-10-27	major	False	False	0	Defence	Defence	Ex-Service Men (Housing)	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1992-10-27.7.2	I do not quite follow my hon Friend's logic when he says that if we did not amalgamate the Staffordshire and Cheshire regiments, we would have no redundancy problems. The fact is that we have made decisions about the amalgamations and there is no reason to believe that they will not go ahead.	1992-10-27a.857.2	Does my right hon Friend realise that he could solve the problem at a stroke if he would do the decent thing as regards the Staffordshire regiment, and have regard to the needs of the infantry? If he would think again about reprieving the Staffordshires and the Cheshires, we would not have so many redundant service men.	1992-10-27a.857.1	person/10134	person/10255	False	1992-10-27	major	False	False	0	Defence	Defence	Ex-Service Men (Housing)	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1992-10-27.7.3	I congratulate the hon Gentleman on the occasion of his first contribution on defence matters from the Opposition Front Bench. I am sure that we shall be hearing from him in the future. Let me go back over what I have said. It is not true that service men cannot purchase their own houses. Many can do so, because the serious amounts of redundancy money that they receive can go some way towards enabling them to purchase their own homes. In addition, the deals that we are doing with housing associations will make it possible for people to rent premises through those associations when they leave the services. We will keep a number of the allocations available.	1992-10-27a.857.4	On 28 April the Minister gave the House an assurance that ex-personnel returning from Germany would be given accommodation for themselves and their families. Does that promise still stand, and is the Minister aware that many ex-service men will be unable to buy their own homes because they will come straight out of the armed forces on to the dole queue? What is needed is low-cost rental housing. What does the Minister propose to do to tackle that problem?	1992-10-27a.857.3	person/10421	person/10255	False	1992-10-27	major	False	False	0	Defence	Defence	Ex-Service Men (Housing)	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1992-10-27.7.4	I hope that my hon Friend will agree with me that one reason for our having large forces was that we were opposed by the massed forces of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw pact, both of which have now disintegrated. Given that the main strength opposing us had to some degree disappeared and had certainly been ameliorated, it was only right that we should look again at the level of defence expenditure that we were incurring.	1992-10-27a.857.6	"Does my right hon Friend agree that the best way of solving the problem of housing redundant soldiers is to make fewer soldiers redundant, and that, given that the forces of reaction are gathering pace in Russia and that southern and south-eastern Europe are reverting to tribalism, this is not the time to pursue ""Options for Change"" with the vigour with which it has been pursued so far?"	1992-10-27a.857.5	person/22580	person/10255	False	1992-10-27	major	False	False	0	Defence	Defence	Ex-Service Men (Housing)	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

The programme that we have already initiated is worth £30 million in that one area alone. That shows the seriousness with which we are seeking to assist President Yeltsin in the very important work that he is doing.	1992-10-27a.858.3	With Russia sliding into chaos, the need to control the 10,000 ballistic missiles on its soil is even more urgent. Given that the present rate of dismantling Russian weapons means that that will take 15 years, how many of the promised nuclear warhead containers have been constructed and how many have been delivered? Does the Secretary of State agree that unless we provide generous financial and technical assistance, we will undermine President Yeltsin in the same way that we undermined President Gorbachev? Is not a Marshall plan preferable to martial law?	1992-10-27a.858.2	person/10384	person/11660	True	1992-10-27	major	False	False	0	Defence	Defence	Nuclear Weapons (Russia)	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1992-10-27.8.1	We have made an assessment of the number of conventional and nuclear submarines that the country requires. Obviously, some decisions still have to be taken with regard to the decommissioning of nuclear submarines in the longer term. That is also dependent on wider decisions which the Government are addressing at the moment.	1992-10-27a.858.5	The Government's assistance to President Yeltsin in the dismantling of nuclear weapons must be welcomed and encouraged. Does my right hon and learned Friend agree that there is considerable anxiety nearer home about the future of nuclear submarines which are unused and in moth balls? Can he give the House any assurance about what will happen to those nuclear plants in the near future?	1992-10-27a.858.4	person/16432	person/11660	False	1992-10-27	major	False	False	0	Defence	Defence	Nuclear Weapons (Russia)	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

obviously not aware that even in 10 years' time, when Russia will have completed the process of reducing its strategic nuclear warheads, it will still possess more than 3,000 strategic nuclear warheads and that will be six times as many as the United Kingdom will have when Trident is deployed."	1992-10-27a.858.7	Can the Secretary of State explain in what way he thinks that he is helping Russia's nuclear de-escalation or the political position of Boris Yeltsin when Britain is escalating its nuclear capacity in strategic ballistic missiles by 250 per cent. and at the same time absolutely refusing to respond to Boris Yeltsin's offer of a nuclear moratorium? Does he not realise that that undermines the process of nuclear de-escalation inside Russia and that it strengthens the forces of reaction in that country? Does he not also realise that unless he is prepared to show sufficient support and goodwill to the reform process in Russia, the sands of time for democracy in that country will run out all the more quickly?	1992-10-27a.858.6	person/10501	person/11660	False	1992-10-27	major	False	False	0	Defence	Defence	Nuclear Weapons (Russia)	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

We will certainly look constructively at any proposals dealing with the dismantling of existing nuclear weapons.	1992-10-27a.859.3	My right hon and learned Friend will know the difficulties with dismantling nuclear weapons.

1992-10-27.9.0	The TASM is only one of the options that we are considering in order to continue with Britain's sub-strategic nuclear capability. The hon Gentleman should realise that, in terms of our national interests and our commitment to the NATO alliance, the doctrine of flexible response requires there to be a sub-strategic capability if deterrence is to achieve its full responsibility.	1992-10-27a.859.8	Given that the tactical air-to-surface missile could cost more than £3 billion, given the very welcome American moratorium on nuclear tests which will make development of the warhead difficult, and given that the Germans are unlikely to allow it on their soil, would not it be better to abandon the programme now, use some of the money to make sure that we have sufficient conventional troops to meet the Government's increasing commitments and some of the money on the diversifica-stion of the defence industry?	1992-10-27a.859.7	person/10038	person/11660	True	1992-10-27	major	False	False	0	Defence	Defence	Air-To-Surface Missile	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

We would expect to come to a decision some time early in the new year.	1992-10-27a.860.0	Bearing in mind the experience of Tornado aircraft in the Gulf, does my right hon and learned Friend agree that if that aircraft is to remain viable into the new century it will need a stand-off weapon, or it will be obsolete?	1992-10-27a.859.9	person/18318	person/11660	False	1992-10-27	major	False	False	0	Defence	Defence	Air-To-Surface Missile	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1992-10-27.10.0	In the time that he spent preparing that question, the hon Gentleman clearly did not read all of the CBI quarterly survey. If he had done, he would have seen output expectations up on September, export optimism up on July, the domestic prices balance at an all-time low and, for the first time ever, the balance of firms reporting unit costs actually being reduced. As to improving economic circumstances, the hon Gentleman should note what has been done. Interest rates have been cut 11 times in two years. They are the lowest interest rates in Europe, and British firms also face the lowest corporate tax rates in Europe.	1992-10-27a.860.6	As the Prime Minister bobbles about helplessly in a sea of chaos, has he noticed the latest damning evidence of economic decline in today's Confederation of British Industry review, yet one of last week's U-turns—just one of them—promised economic growth?

Unfortunately, of course, there is no permanent machinery for trying war crimes, although the General Assembly of the United Nations has been discussing such permanent machinery.

1992-10-27.10.3	I am most grateful to my hon Friend for what he has had to say. Let me say this on the European Community and the Government's policy. I believe that we have had three historic mistakes over the last 30 years in European policy. [Interruption.] The first was when we failed to join the Community at the outset. The second was when twice other countries refused to accept Britain into the European Community. They were mistakes of great damage, to not just this country but the whole of the European Community. Today, with the possibility of enlargement through the changing policies in Europe, we have more of a chance than ever we have had before of building a European Community in the image that we in this country wish to see. It would be folly at this stage to throw that away by isolating ourselves in the Community and by ending our influence.

No. The result is that we have to clean up the mess.	2012-01-26a.392.1	Is not the truth of the matter that this episode has led to a frenzy of additional applications? There has been a 1,100% increase in the number of people trying to get systems installed in their homes in a short period of time.

I simply remind Labour Members that the Leader of the Opposition introduced a scheme at a cost of £7.9 billion. That went directly to consumers, and there was no way whatever of controlling those costs. He so doubted the dynamism of the private sector that he predicted no commercial take-up of solar power in the first three years of the scheme, even while solar costs were tumbling, and he ignored the best practice of the German FITs scheme and failed to include a system of automatic degression. All this Government are doing is clearing up the mess that Labour left behind."	2012-01-26a.392.3	It is becoming uncomfortable watching the Secretary of State trying to defend the indefensible.

2012-01-26.0.4	The absolute key to what is happening with solar panels is the collapse in the cost. The idea that something might not be attractive commercially today does not mean that it will not be so in pretty short order. What has been happening over the past 18 months is an enormous increase in the production capacity of China. Essentially, what has happened is that the Henry Ford of solar panels—who happens to be Chinese these days—has introduced the Model T, and we are getting an enormous reduction in costs as a result of economies of scale.	2012-01-26a.393.1	The Minister may be aware that there are hundreds of Harlow residents in social housing who were promised solar power panels, but the new rate is too low for the scheme to be viable. Will my right hon Friend tell the House whether he would consider a more generous community rate for the feed-in tariff, even if it was for only a few months?	2012-01-26a.393.0	person/24784	person/11565	False	2012-01-26	cameron	False	False	0	Business, Energy And Industrial Strategy	Energy And Climate Change	Photovoltaics	0	conservative	True	False	liberal-democrat	False	False
2012-01-26.0.5	What is absolutely crucial for the sector is that there should be a sustainable pathway for growth in the future. What the right hon Lady has completely failed to address is the fact that if we continued to over-subsidise at the previous rate, we would have fewer than half the installations that we can afford to subsidise today with the new rate. It was not an accident that the British Photovoltaic Association intervened on our side in the courts, precisely as a result of that calculation.	2012-01-26a.393.3	"When the cuts to solar were announced, the Minister of State, the hon Member for Bexhill and Battle (Gregory Barker) claimed that they would create jobs. Paragraph 73 of the impact assessment, signed off by the Minister on 2 November 2011 , says that
“there could be around 1,000 to 10,000 gross additional jobs in this sector in the three years to 2014/15”.
Can the Secretary of State confirm today that those 1,000 to 10,000 jobs are not additional jobs, but the total number that the industry will support, which, for a sector that currently employs nearly 30,000 people, means tens of thousands of job losses?"	2012-01-26a.393.2	person/10202	person/11565	False	2012-01-26	cameron	False	False	2	Business, Energy And Industrial Strategy	Energy And Climate Change	Photovoltaics	1	labour	False	True	liberal-democrat	False	False
2012-01-26.0.6	I entirely reject the idea that we did not act to deal with this issue as soon as we were advised. The problem with the design of the scheme was that it was unable to cope with the dramatic fall in the cost of solar panels. That dramatic fall, the reason for which I have already described, became apparent over the past year, and we acted as quickly as we could to deal with the situation. What is unforgivable is the fact that the present Leader of the Opposition failed to foresee, by looking at best practice internationally, how the scheme should have been designed in the first place.	2012-01-26a.394.3	The Secretary of State is right to say that the design of the scheme he inherited from Labour was flawed. However, by continuing with that scheme for 18 months, coupled with apparently poor legal advice, the implementation of FITs that he has presided over has been somewhat chaotically managed for consumers and businesses alike. I am concerned that a letter from the Minister of State says that if there is no action, proposals may have to be brought forward to close the FITs scheme. What reassurance can the Secretary of State give that FITs will be put on a sustainable footing for the rest of this Parliament?	2012-01-26a.394.2	person/11971	person/11565	False	2012-01-26	cameron	False	False	0	Business, Energy And Industrial Strategy	Energy And Climate Change	Photovoltaics	0	liberal-democrat	False	False	liberal-democrat	False	False
2012-01-26.1.0	I am afraid that it was actually under the last Labour Government, when the present Leader of the Opposition was Secretary of State, that the number of tariffs went up to 400, an increase of 75%. We are now getting to grips with that, but if the hon Gentleman wants to blame someone for the proliferation of tariffs, he should blame the total inaction of the then Secretary of State.	2012-01-26a.395.1	Does the Minister grasp the seriousness of the situation facing families across the country? The average fuel bill is now £1,345 a year—an increase of 48% in the last five years. When are the Government going to act to pare back the system of tariffs—the number of which has risen by 70 in the past year under this Government—which discriminates against those who use the least energy?	2012-01-26a.395.0	person/24697	person/10713	True	2012-01-26	cameron	False	False	0	Business, Energy And Industrial Strategy	Energy And Climate Change	Energy Bills	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False

We would also look at how we might drive that by making amendments to consequential improvements. I am very interested in my hon Friend’s ideas.	2012-01-26a.395.3	Does the Minister realise that he could help businesses, as well as households, to reduce their energy bills, by introducing mandatory motion-sensitive lighting systems? That would reduce the carbon intensity of our built environment and promote the ability of many people to enjoy starry, starry nights.	2012-01-26a.395.2	person/24895	person/10713	False	2012-01-26	cameron	False	False	0	Business, Energy And Industrial Strategy	Energy And Climate Change	Energy Bills	0	conservative	True	False	conservative	True	False
2012-01-26.1.2	The hon Lady is right; we are slightly behind. The unseasonably warm weather that we have had this winter, compared with the cold weather last year, has meant that the number of applications has been lower. However, I am in touch with the leaders of our big metropolitan authorities, and I have spoken to the big six energy companies, Citizens Advice and others this week in order to drive forward the roll-out of Warm Front to ensure that we do not have the underspend that she has highlighted.	2012-01-26a.395.5	It is understood that there has been a significant underspend, of up to £30 million, in the Warm Front scheme, because DECC has made the eligibility criteria too strict and has not promoted the scheme. That means that up to 20% of the scheme’s funding could go unclaimed. Is it correct that there will be an underspend at the end of the financial year, and if so, what is the reason for it?	2012-01-26a.395.4	person/24910	person/10713	False	2012-01-26	cameron	False	False	0	Business, Energy And Industrial Strategy	Energy And Climate Change	Energy Bills	0	green	False	False	conservative	True	False

which is an energy efficiency roll-out that will reduce the amount of electricity and heating required in homes, but I will certainly be happy to look at her ideas."	2012-01-26a.395.7	The green deal has just been described as the “game-changer”, but the concern being expressed by those living in Thirsk, Malton and Filey is that it will push up their household energy bills. Will the Minister follow up the suggestion put to the Prime Minister yesterday by looking favourably on schemes such as biomass, rather than unreliable wind farms, in the green energy mix?	2012-01-26a.395.6	person/10389	person/10713	False	2012-01-26	cameron	False	False	0	Business, Energy And Industrial Strategy	Energy And Climate Change	Energy Bills	0	conservative	True	False	conservative	True	False
2012-01-26.1.4	As I said earlier, the number of tariffs proliferated by 75% in the last three years of the Labour Government, when they had the opportunity to do something about this. We actually want everyone to be on cheaper tariffs, but there is lots to do, because of the appalling inheritance from the last Government. We want everyone to get a good deal, not just the over-75s, and we are taking action to make that happen.	2012-01-26a.396.1	According to an answer that I received to a question just the other day, the underspend is actually £32 million, so it has gone up. We all know that soaring energy bills are contributing to the cost of living crisis afflicting millions of families. Millions of pensioners over the age of 75, who are the most susceptible to the cold weather and the least able to access the advantages of online energy deals, pay more for their electricity and gas than they need to. Surely it is only fair that energy companies should guarantee that elderly customers over the age of 75 should be placed on the cheapest tariff for their gas and electricity. Will the Government ensure that the energy companies have access to the data that they will need in order to achieve that?	2012-01-26a.396.0	person/10202	person/10713	False	2012-01-26	cameron	False	False	0	Business, Energy And Industrial Strategy	Energy And Climate Change	Energy Bills	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False

At the Environment Council in March, the Secretary of State will argue strongly for approval of the EU low-carbon road map, which sets out milestones for reducing emissions through to 2050.	2012-01-26a.396.6	The Secretary of State has publicly and consistently expressed his desire to see the EU 2020 emissions reduction target increase to 30%, but what concrete action will he take to realise that ambition?	2012-01-26a.396.5	person/24873	person/10713	True	2012-01-26	cameron	False	False	0	Business, Energy And Industrial Strategy	Energy And Climate Change	Kyoto Protocol	0	conservative	True	False	conservative	True	False

2012-01-26.4.0	My hon Friend makes a very important point. That is one of the most important mechanisms we have in any part of Government policy to bring benefits to consumers.

2012-01-26.5.0	The hon Gentleman has clearly been hibernating over the past few months if he believes that we are not helping poor families. First, the warm home discount scheme, which is a statutory scheme for reducing costs, will disburse two thirds more money than was disbursed under the voluntary scheme operated by the Labour Government. Secondly, the affordable warmth obligation in the energy company obligation subsidy will take over from Warm Front. Thirdly, we have asked Professor John Hills to conduct a thorough review of fuel poverty, which will lead to some interesting and important recommendations.	2012-01-26a.399.8	Is the Secretary of State proud of the fact that this is the first Government since 1970 who have not had a programme to help poor families with their fuel costs? Is it not the case now that many poor families will get less help, and that there is virtually no targeting of those resources that are available to the poorest families?	2012-01-26a.399.7	person/10625	person/11565	True	2012-01-26	cameron	False	False	0	Business, Energy And Industrial Strategy	Energy And Climate Change	Energy Efficiency	0	labour	False	True	liberal-democrat	False	False
2012-01-26.5.1	It is important that the hon Gentleman compares like with like.

2012-01-26.5.2	My hon Friend is absolutely right that such skills will be essential for the green deal—indeed, for the whole low-carbon economy. That is precisely why we have been working closely with the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, which takes the lead on skills. We have a national skills academy for environmental technologies, which is developing standards, delivering training and upskilling tradesmen and technicians. We also have funding for the renewables training network that is run by Renewable UK, and a talent bank for the gas, power, waste management and water industries, which is led by the Energy and Utility Skills sector skills council.	2012-01-26a.400.2	The green deal skills alliance has highlighted the importance of having the right skilled professionals in place to deliver the green deal to households. How will my right hon Friend ensure that we have the right number of skilled energy efficiency assessors, installers and training providers to make sure that when the green deal comes in this year we can deliver it?	2012-01-26a.400.1	person/24750	person/11565	False	2012-01-26	cameron	False	False	0	Business, Energy And Industrial Strategy	Energy And Climate Change	Energy Efficiency	0	conservative	True	False	liberal-democrat	False	False
2012-01-26.5.3	I think the hon Lady misunderstands a couple of issues. First, the green deal is a very different scheme precisely because it is designed to support a complete retrofit. We are talking not just about cavity wall insulation or loft insulation but about many other measures as well. The second point is that she is quoting the first impact assessment. It has always been the case that the take-up of the green deal will depend on the triggers and incentives that have been introduced for take-up, which have increased substantially since the figures she quoted.	2012-01-26a.400.4	I understand that the Government have not yet even designed the training programme for many of the people who will have to deliver the green deal. Ministers have been claiming for months that the green deal will mean the creation of thousands of jobs, but the Department’s figures show that the number of energy efficiency installations will plummet in the first year of the scheme, with cavity wall insulations set to fall by 67% and loft insulations by a staggering 90%. That will cripple the sector and, according to Europe Economics, could lead to the loss of 3,000 jobs. Will the Secretary of State protect those jobs by adopting Labour’s proposals to include hard-to-treat cavity walls and lofts in the ECO?	2012-01-26a.400.3	person/24924	person/11565	False	2012-01-26	cameron	False	False	0	Business, Energy And Industrial Strategy	Energy And Climate Change	Energy Efficiency	0	labour	False	True	liberal-democrat	False	False
2012-01-26.6.0	I am very happy to join the hon Gentleman in encouraging the third sector in this regard.

The winning communities in the remaining, second tranche are due to be announced in early February.	2012-01-26a.401.4	Charities and not-for-profit groups up and down the country have enormous in-house expertise on this matter and are ready and willing to do more work with businesses and local authorities on the green deal. Good firms such as Morrisons do a great deal in partnership work.

The people who should benefit from a competitive energy market are the companies’ customers—our constituents. Is he aware of the practice by some energy companies of repeatedly putting up direct debit payment demands?

2012-01-26.13.4	It is a very serious question and I am grateful to the hon Gentleman for pursuing it further. Some of the crude produced in this country is not suitable for use here because of the diesel demand and therefore it is exported, and the diesel fuel tends to have to be imported, which results in an imbalance. Through the downstream oil infrastructure forum we are looking at the industry’s strategy to put in place a long-term programme to assess how we can support and build up that industry, and the role of international investors is critical to that process.	2012-01-26a.407.5	The Secretary of State seemed to misunderstand my question on oil refinery capacity earlier.

However, I accept the importance of what the hon Gentleman said."	1979-06-13a.417.6	I thank the Minister for that reply. Is he aware that there is deep appreciation in this country of the courageous efforts made by Egypt and Israel in arriving at a peace settlement? The visit of the Egyptian Foreign Minister would indeed allow this Government to express their appreciation for the efforts that were made. Is the Minister also aware that there is now urgent need to help Egypt, both economically and industrially, in the development of that country? That is surely an endeavour in which this country, along with Western Europe, could probably play an important role.

1979-06-13.4.1	With regard to the second part of the hon Gentleman's question, naturally the Government regret certain statements by both sides which are likely to make an agreement more difficult or impossible. As for the first part, as I said in my speech on the Gracious Address, we deeply regret Israel's settlement policy. Like practically all the rest of the world, we regard it as illegal and as an obstacle to peace.	1979-06-13a.418.1	Will the right hon Gentleman be discussing with the Egyptian Foreign Minister the implications for the Camp David accords and the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty of the expropriation of Arab land on the West Bank for the benefit of a new Jewish settlement, and the public statements by Mr. Begin that he has no intention that Israel should surrender control of either the West Bank or Gaza?	1979-06-13a.418.0	person/17822	person/17522	False	1979-06-13	thatcher	False	False	0	Foreign And Commonwealth Affairs	Foreign And Commonwealth Affairs	Egypt (Foreign Minister)	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1979-06-13.5.0	The Governor took the opportunity to explain to the Chinese authorities the serious problems created for Hong Kong by the continuing high rate of both legal and illegal immigration into Hong Kong from China. The Chinese admitted that the measures taken up to that time had not been effective, and they undertook to do more. Since that time, my right hon and noble Friend and I have had conversations with the Chinese ambassador in London, and representations have been made in Peking, pointing out to the Chinese Government the serious situation that is being created for Hong Kong. I am glad to say that the figures on legal immigration have shown something of a drop. We should like to see a further drop. The figures on illegal immigration remain very serious. The strength of the garrison is kept under constant review. A decision about whether any change is necessary in the present circumstances will be taken after Ministers have had an opportunity to discuss the current situation in Hong Kong with the governor during his visit this week.	1979-06-13a.419.0	"I welcome the good co-operation. May I ask the Minister whether the discussions on immigration made it plain that the present flow of refugees, now totalling 100,000 detected so far this year—which threatens to inundate Hong Kong—cannot be allowed to continue? Therefore, will the Government make it plain to the Peking Government that we look to them for strong


action on this front? Will we back it up by reinforcing the troops in Hong Kong?

1979-06-13.5.1	I certainly do not regard Hong Kong as an anachronism. It is a success story. But, since the visit of the governor was not for the purposes of negotiation, it would not have been appropriate for the long-term future of Hong Kong to be discussed. I can also tell the hon Gentleman that the Chinese leaders took the opportunity of the governor's visit to emphasise to him the importance to them of maintaining confidence and investment in Hong Kong, and they particularly asked that Hong Kong investors should be reassured about the future.	1979-06-13a.419.2	During the discussions with the Chinese Government, was the anachronism of the colony of Hong Kong discussed?

of the garrison shows great ignorance of the situation in Hong Kong?

However, I regard that eventuality as unlikely.	1979-06-13a.421.0	"Has the right hon Gentleman noticed the statement at the press conference three weeks ago by Mr. Denktash that the future of the British military bases in Cyprus was not irrelevant to any settlement that might take place?

Will my hon Friend, nevertheless, give the House an assurance that the Government will adopt an active rather than a passive role in trying to help the Chinese satisfy their defensive requirements for their border with the Soviet Union?

1979-06-13.11.3	The hon Gentleman will remember that the Community managed to find a way of halting aid to Amin that was generally accepted as satisfactory. A distinction was made between certain kinds of aid which were short term and others which were long term. Nevertheless, it is because of the difficulty that arose that my right hon and noble Friend and the Government are trying to find in Lomé II a better means of dealing with that problem, and I think that we shall succeed.	1979-06-13a.430.2	I recognise what the hon Gentleman said, but should we not go further than his bland statement? The convention prevented the EEC from terminating all aid to Amin in the past year or so, and it can still give aid to despicable regimes such as that of Emperor Bokassa.

Secondly, will he agree with the need to recognise the commitments that have been made? That is absolutely essential.

However, I would point out that there are a number of tickets in this country that are cheaper than those in Europe.	2013-04-25b.990.0	The McNulty report identified significant costs incurred on our railways compared with those of our European counterparts.

I would point out that the previous Labour Government planned that 70% of costs would be met by fare payers by 2013-14.	2013-04-25b.990.2	Given that the National Audit Office has warned that higher rail fares could lead to greater profits for the train companies, why has the Secretary of State caved in to those companies by giving them permission to increase their fares by up to 5% above his so-called cap?	2013-04-25b.990.1	person/11531	person/10397	False	2013-04-25	cameron	False	False	0	Transport	Transport	Rail Fares/Ticketing Review	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False

However, booking three tickets—Glasgow to Preston, Preston to Manchester, and Manchester to Sheffield—is half that cost.

2013-04-25.1.0	The performance of local authorities and passenger transport executives across the country varies enormously. The education maintenance allowance was replaced by the 16 to 19 bursary fund—£180 million provided by the Department for Education. I am in discussions with my colleagues at that Department about access to education. With reference to access to work, the hon Lady will be aware not only of the steps taken under the local sustainable transport fund to help access to work, but the initiative on which I have worked with bus operators to ensure that there was free access for some people out of work in January.	2013-04-25b.991.1	That is a good thing, because the education maintenance allowance helped young people with travel costs, but this Government have abolished it, leaving them struggling. Many young people will have extra travel costs if they are to take up apprenticeships. Our constrained local transport authority, Transport for Greater Manchester, cannot manage to help with that. The Minister says that this is a priority, so will he review the position urgently, because it is stopping young people getting into education and taking up apprenticeships opportunities? Will he also look at putting some central costs in, because our local transport authority does not have the budget to help with this?	2013-04-25b.991.0	person/11943	person/10022	True	2013-04-25	cameron	False	False	0	Transport	Transport	Bus Travel (Young People)	0	labour	False	True	liberal-democrat	False	False

I remember my grandmother telling me, “A stitch in time saves nine.” It is for the Government to start believing that that is a good way forward for the maintenance of our roads.

Recent studies at the Martin Prosperity Institute at the University of Toronto have identified that two of the world’s 40 co-called mega-regions are in the United Kingdom and that good, fast rail connections would benefit both.

2013-04-25.4.7	I sometimes wonder which world the shadow Secretary of State lives in. If she would just do us all a favour and listen for one minute, I will offer her an explanation. First, the premium that the east coast main line pays to the Treasury is less than that paid by the west coast main line. Secondly, if the hon Lady looks at reliability over the latest four-week period, she will see that the east coast main line is the worst of the 19 operators. Thirdly, we have found that the operator did a reasonable job in difficult circumstances when it had to take over the direct operation, but that it has now reached a plateau. Fourthly, yes, there will be taxpayers’ money involved in investing in the east coast main line, but, more importantly, the involvement of the private sector means that we can increase, over and above the taxpayers’ money, the money that can be invested in enhancing and improving the service for passengers.	2013-04-25b.995.7	It does not sound like the Minister actually knows what is happening on the east coast main line: 3 million more seats, best ever punctuality, lowest taxpayer subsidy, £40 million of extra profit invested and £800 million returned to the taxpayer. He should stop talking it down. Will he confirm that all of the planned east coast upgrade—all the investment that his hon and right hon Friends claim is necessary—will be paid for by the taxpayer? None of this investment is dependent on privatisation. The fact is that private train companies now receive more from the taxpayer each year than they pay back in, so why is he doing this?	2013-04-25b.995.6	person/10183	person/10079	False	2013-04-25	cameron	False	False	0	Transport	Transport	High Speed 2	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False
2013-04-25.5.0	I always try to provide leadership, Mr Speaker. I fully understand the valid point that the hon Lady makes, but there are consideration problems with her proposition. HS2 Ltd did consider whether Stratford should be the primary terminus for HS2 services and others. Its advice was that locating the principal HS2 terminus outside central London would not meet the needs of the majority of the passengers who will use the service or make best use of the wider London transport network. There would also be physical problems with the need to build an additional 10 platforms, given the geographic size of the site at Stratford.	2013-04-25b.996.4	I thank the Minister for that answer. Following about £1 billion-worth of investment, Stratford has an international train station but, sadly, it currently has no stopping international trains. Given that investment, Stratford should surely be a transport hub, fully interconnecting HS1, HS2, Crossrail 1 and Crossrail 2 with domestic and underground services. That would not only provide superb interconnectivity, but relieve stress on central London terminals.

As you will know as a politician yourself, Mr Speaker, if one makes promises, they must have some validity and credibility, and one must have the ability to fund them. As my hon Friend rightly said, the UKIP manifesto at the last election, which you probably read more than most of us, Mr Speaker, stated that it would:
“Invest in three new 200mph plus high-speed rail lines including a new line between London and Newcastle with a spur to Manchester, a London-Bristol-Exeter line and a linking route via Birmingham”.
It really is extraordinary—"	2013-04-25b.996.6	My concerns about HS2 will come as no surprise to my right hon Friend, but is he surprised at the concerns of UKIP, which, quite apart from believing that every last Bulgarian and Romanian is about to hitchhike their way to London, is opposed to HS2, whereas in 2010 it did not support just one high-speed line, but three?	2013-04-25b.996.5	person/24747	person/10079	False	2013-04-25	cameron	False	False	0	Transport	Transport	High Speed 2	1	conservative	True	False	conservative	True	False

Those matters will be considered in due course, but we have to go through the due processes first.	2013-04-25b.997.1	There is a growing view that by the time the second phase of HS2 is complete, Crossrail 2 will be essential to cope with the additional passengers travelling through Euston station.

2013-04-25.9.2	As I said in the replies I have just given, I am not ruling that out—I am looking at it. The hon Gentleman makes important arguments that go the other way. It is not a straightforward issue.	2013-04-25b.999.8	The human cost in lives, the economic cost of infrastructure changes and the environmental impact of carbon emissions are surely all good enough reasons to rule out once and for all any increase in the speed limit.	2013-04-25b.999.7	person/11707	person/10397	False	2013-04-25	cameron	False	False	0	Transport	Transport	Motorway Speed Limit	0	liberal-democrat	False	False	conservative	True	False
2013-04-25.10.0	Recent research by the Association of Train Operating Companies shows that the number of rail journeys in and around Birmingham has increased by more than 20% in the past five years. It is one of 14 cities to record double-digit growth. In a way, I am not surprised to hear of the problems that that is causing for my hon Friend’s constituents, and I am more than happy to meet him and Centro to discuss the matter.	2013-04-25b.1000.2	Rowley Regis station in my constituency provides a vital link for commuters into Birmingham and the surrounding area, but the car parking facilities at the station have reached capacity. Will the Secretary of State meet me and Centro representatives to push forward on the vital project to expand car parking facilities so that commuters do not have to park on residential streets?	2013-04-25b.1000.1	person/24855	person/10397	True	2013-04-25	cameron	False	False	0	Transport	Transport	Train Stations	0	conservative	True	False	conservative	True	False

Plymouth is a case in point—Network Rail’s buildings there are appalling. Given that Network Rail says that it is more reactive than proactive, what discussions is the Secretary of State having with his colleagues in the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the Department for Communities and Local Government to encourage development, and to encourage Network Rail to take commercial advantage of some of its sites?	2013-04-25b.1000.3	person/11760	person/10397	False	2013-04-25	cameron	False	False	0	Transport	Transport	Train Stations	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False
2013-04-25.11.0	My hon Friend makes a very good point. It is important that we make proper use of all the infrastructure available, particularly in respect of bodies such as the Highways Agency. My understanding is that the agency makes details of the current fibre optic communication network available to any interested party, but following my hon Friend’s points, I will speak to the agency and see whether we can do more.	2013-04-25b.1001.1	I thank the Secretary of State for the money he has put in for the pinch-point between the A46 and the M5. In other A46 news, a local village has discovered that fibre optic cable runs along it, and has connected some of the local homes to it. Will the Secretary of State consider asking the Highways Agency to publish information on all roads on the network that have fibre optic cable along them?	2013-04-25b.1001.0	person/24785	person/10397	True	2013-04-25	cameron	False	True	0	Transport	Transport	Topical Questions	0	conservative	True	False	conservative	True	False

I believe the changes that HS2 will bring—the first new railway line built north of London in 120 years—will provide an important impetus for economic growth for the United Kingdom.	2013-04-25b.1002.2	May I press the Secretary of State to provide me some evidence? I started off as a supporter of HS2. I attended a seminar in this House this week that predicted that it would cost £50 billion.

They fall under a certain financial limit and are completed by March 2015. We are in discussions on how further tranches will work in terms of the extension of the date of completion. I am convinced that given the record of the A64—one of the criteria is safety—it will be looked on favourably.	2013-04-25b.1002.4	The A64 is an extremely dangerous and highly congested road serving businesses along the route right through Thirsk and Malton between York, Filey and Scarborough.

2013-04-25.11.7	I point the hon Gentleman to what was said by the last Labour Transport Secretary, the right hon Member for Tooting (Sadiq Khan) who now sits on the Opposition Front Bench. It is worth pointing out that National Express paid £185 million in 2007-08, £145 million in 2008-09 and £8 million in 2009-10, which is when the franchise ended. The way that the track excess charges were calculated was then changed, so direct comparisons are not valid.	2013-04-25b.1002.6	The east coast main line has returned £640 million to the public purse since 2009. Sadly, private ownership has failed the travelling public of the east coast franchise. What possible public benefit can be gained by another wasteful and expensive round of refranchising, when east coast is already where the vast majority of the public want it, in public ownership?	2013-04-25b.1002.5	person/24919	person/10397	False	2013-04-25	cameron	False	True	0	Transport	Transport	Topical Questions	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False
2013-04-25.11.8	Yes, I do. HS2 Ltd’s policy is to reply substantively to all letters from Members within 20 working days. It is unfortunate that my hon Friend did not receive a reply to his letter. I have been informed by HS2 Ltd that a response and an apology have now been issued and that its procedures for handling correspondence with hon Members have been looked at again to ensure that this sort of problem does not arise.	2013-04-25b.1003.1	My right hon Friend has been exceptionally communicative and has taken the time to discuss HS2 and the route with the constituencies affected, but that is in stark contrast to HS2 Ltd, which still has not responded to a letter I sent it on 22 February .

2013-04-25.11.9	Sadly, bus fares have been rising above inflation for many decades, including throughout the Labour Government, from 1997 to 2010, although some of these bus fares are determined locally by support from local authorities, so the picture varies across the country. The good news, however, is that overall bus mileage is holding up. In fact, last year saw a record 4.7 billion bus journeys, the highest since deregulation.	2013-04-25b.1003.3	An investigation by the Liverpool Echo last month discovered that the cost of catching a bus in Merseyside has risen by two and a half times the rate of inflation since privatisation under the Thatcher Government. The cost of public transport in Merseyside is a barrier to employment and makes the labour market less flexible. Will the Minister congratulate the Echo on its work and tell us what he proposes to do about it?	2013-04-25b.1003.2	person/24897	person/10022	False	2013-04-25	cameron	False	True	0	Transport	Transport	Topical Questions	0	labour	False	True	liberal-democrat	False	False
2013-04-25.11.10	I thank my hon Friend for that question. It would be premature at this stage to give the sort of assurances he wants, because it is part and parcel of the whole issue of capacity in the south-east and so is a matter for the Davies commission as part its wider inquiry into the future of airports and capacity.	2013-04-25b.1003.5	Many of my constituents work in and use both Heathrow and Gatwick airports, which is one reason I would firmly support the expansion of both. We are awaiting Howard Davies’s report into Heathrow expansion, but would the Minister consider his Department’s investigating the feasibility of a superfast maglev line, such as that seen in Shanghai, to link these two essential airports?	2013-04-25b.1003.4	person/24765	person/10079	False	2013-04-25	cameron	False	True	0	Transport	Transport	Topical Questions	0	conservative	True	False	conservative	True	False

been 13 years of Labour Government, and they did not reverse it—in fact, they enhanced and pushed forward the franchising. The last Labour Secretary of State said that franchising was a good thing. I believe he was right and that passengers benefit from it."	2013-04-25b.1003.7	In answer to an earlier question from my hon Friend the Member for Rotherham (Sarah Champion) , the Secretary of State said that he made decisions based on evidence.

2013-04-25.12.1	The hon Gentleman is wrong in his implication. As I said in my previous answer to my right hon Friend the Member for Bermondsey and Old Southwark (Simon Hughes) , I am considering these proposals, discussing them with colleagues and looking at the practical issues. When I visited the Scottish Parliament during the February recess, I saw in its parliamentary bureau what is to all intents and purposes a House business committee. When one looks at how that works, Back Bench Members in this House already have considerably more influence and control over the scope of debate than Members of the Scottish Parliament. It is not about creating a thing with a title; it is about delivering the objective.	2013-04-25b.1005.2	I am sure that the whole House is overwhelmed to hear that one member of the Cabinet is interested in the views of Select Committees; perhaps the Leader of the House could have a word with the Secretary of State for Education about the merits of that. This is yet another handbrake turn and broken promise by the coalition. What is the delay? The deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats supports it and the Government Chief Whip is a vocal supporter of a House business committee, so who is holding it up?	2013-04-25b.1005.1	person/24730	person/10349	False	2013-04-25	cameron	False	False	0	Cabinet Office	Leader Of The House	House Business Committee	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False
2013-04-25.12.2	My hon Friend is making assumptions about the character of a House business committee based on the Wright Committee recommendations, which are being considered by the Political and Constitutional Reform Committee, to which I am sure he will be giving his views. It is important to recognise that among the evidence that the Committee has already received is evidence about the impracticality of implementing the Wright Committee recommendations as first set out, not least because we have already made progress in the Back Bench Business Committee.	2013-04-25b.1005.4	A House business committee would timetable business in this House. Were there to be a rule that it must facilitate Government business—and given that its make-up is likely to reflect the balance of parties in this place, that it was a firm part of the coalition agreement when other things were dropped, and that we have had three years to sort it out—should there not be a firm commitment in the Queen’s Speech on 8 May ?	2013-04-25b.1005.3	person/11661	person/10349	False	2013-04-25	cameron	False	False	0	Cabinet Office	Leader Of The House	House Business Committee	0	conservative	True	False	conservative	True	False

2013-04-25.14.0	I thank my hon Friend for that question. I know this is a matter that she has been pursuing vigorously. The issue with her proposal for statutory instruments is that the two Houses could end up amending a statutory instrument in different ways. There would then need to be a reconciliation process, very similar to a Bill handling process, so there are concerns about what she suggests. If she has not already done so, she may want to raise the matter with the Chair of the Procedure Committee.	2013-04-25b.1007.0	I am particularly disappointed by that reply. The House prides itself on scrutiny of legislation, but the weakness of the system is scrutiny of statutory instruments, whether to implement primary legislation or, more especially, to transpose EU directives in UK law.

2013-04-25.15.0	May I draw my hon Friend’s attention to the debate taking place at 1.30 this afternoon in Westminster Hall on the Transport Select Committee’s report, “Plug-in vehicles, plugged in policy”? The report contains an extremely good exposé of why the wide variety of vehicle plug-in types makes it difficult to know which to install. That is the core problem, but once the House knows what should be installed, I am sure that we will do our utmost to install it.	2013-04-25b.1008.1	I certainly hope that the House authorities will continue to keep the matter under review, as the vast majority of us in this place have no hope of ever being able to use the electric charge points for official Government cars. My hon Friend may have heard Transport Ministers saying earlier that the private sector was racing ahead in the provision of electric charging points. I hope he might bear that in mind when considering whether more can be done on the parliamentary estate.	2013-04-25b.1008.0	person/24865	person/11280	True	2013-04-25	cameron	False	False	0	House Of Commons Commission	House Of Commons Commission	Electric Vehicles (Charging Facilities)	0	liberal-democrat	False	False	liberal-democrat	False	False

The fact is that there is something deeply wrong with the way in which the House of Commons is being run at the moment. Many Members are dissatisfied with the withdrawal of many services across the piece, in Portcullis House and elsewhere. We also know that the good staff who serve us in our daily work and who do such a good job are totally disillusioned with the way in which this place is being managed. There is a management ethos that this place should be run as a business, but it is not a business. Because of the sittings and the hours, it can never be run as a business, so let us get back to its being run by dedicated staff who should be well treated and well looked after. We must ensure that we look after them because it is essential that we should be able to do our job for our constituents and for our country.	2013-04-25b.1008.7	person/10534	person/10063	True	2013-04-25	cameron	False	False	0	Cabinet Office	Leader Of The House	Member Support	0	labour	False	True	liberal-democrat	False	False

At whatever time of day one goes there for advice or to find out the location of a meeting room, there is no one there to help. I have consulted the police in Portcullis House several times, and they have been extremely helpful, but the do not always have the necessary information. I have therefore been seriously inconvenienced in the pursuit of my constituents’ interests, and I am not alone in that.

2013-04-25.17.0	I do indeed see such a role. Select Committees have a responsibility in relation not only to the policy of the Departments that they scrutinise but to the Departments’ expenditure. It is fair to say, however, that there is a variable focus among Select Committees on the extent to which they scrutinise the expenditure of their Departments, but I hope that we can increase the extent of that scrutiny through the Estimates process. Also, as a member of the Public Accounts Commission, I know from the matters that we have discussed with the National Audit Office that the NAO has already made itself available to some Select Committees to help them with that process, and I hope that we can encourage more of that in future.	2013-04-25b.1009.6	I am grateful to my right hon Friend for that answer, but may I press him further and ask whether he sees a role not only for the Public Accounts Committee but for Select Committees in scrutinising Government and departmental expenditure?	2013-04-25b.1009.5	person/24747	person/10349	True	2013-04-25	cameron	False	False	0	Cabinet Office	Leader Of The House	Government Expenditure (Parliamentary Scrutiny)	0	conservative	True	False	conservative	True	False

2013-04-25.19.0	I would be delighted to commit myself and the authorities to that support.

I commend it to everyone in the House.	2013-04-25b.1010.10	Will my hon Friend give strong support to the apprenticeship scheme started by the senior Clerk of the House, which will give many apprentices across the country the chance to work in the House of Commons? Will he link that scheme with the parliamentary apprenticeship scheme, which I set up with New Deal of the Mind, so that we can all work together on this issue?	2013-04-25b.1010.9	person/24784	person/11280	True	2013-04-25	cameron	False	False	0	House Of Commons Commission	House Of Commons Commission	Apprentices	0	conservative	True	False	liberal-democrat	False	False
2015-02-24.0.0	I am not sure I recognise that picture of the NHS. We know that there are between 6,000 and 8,000 extra nurses, midwives and health visitors working in our NHS than there were under the previous Government. Also, in respect of A and E, the average length of stay in hospital has steadily come down from about eight days in 2000 to about five days now. So our NHS is getting better and improving under the current Government.	2015-02-24c.175.8	But at a time when A and E is in crisis and there are not enough nurses, how on earth can the Minister possibly justify firing and rehiring thousands of NHS staff? What greater sign could there be of a Government with their priorities totally wrong?	2015-02-24c.175.7	person/24881	person/24756	True	2015-02-24	cameron	False	False	0	Health	Health	Nhs Staff	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False
2015-02-24.0.1	"The hon Gentleman will be aware that it was the previous Labour Government who in 2006 set these eye-watering redundancy payments for the NHS, and we have committed to making sure we reform and change that. Therefore, as part of our negotiations and pay offer to NHS staff we want to introduce a redundancy
cap of £80,000. Since many Opposition Members are supported by trade unions, I hope they will encourage union members to back that pay and redundancy cap."	2015-02-24c.175.10	Last year the Prime Minister promised to recover redundancy payments from people who have been rehired. Can the Minister tell us how many payments have been recovered and at what cost?	2015-02-24c.175.9	person/24735	person/24756	True	2015-02-24	cameron	False	False	0	Health	Health	Nhs Staff	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False
2015-02-24.0.2	I am delighted to confirm that, and we have made a conscious decision to reduce NHS waste and bureaucracy. NHS administration spending is down from 4.27% under the previous Government to only 2.77% now, which has resulted in £5 billion of efficiency savings and meant we can invest in about 6,000 more nurses, midwives and health visitors.	2015-02-24c.176.1	Can the Minister confirm that according to the latest figures there are more nurses working in the NHS now than there were in 2010, including an additional 391 at East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust and an additional 59 at Airedale NHS Foundation Trust, the two trusts that serve my constituency?	2015-02-24c.176.0	person/24759	person/24756	False	2015-02-24	cameron	False	False	0	Health	Health	Nhs Staff	0	conservative	True	False	conservative	True	False
2015-02-24.0.3	The most important thing we have done is support our front-line staff with additional investment in the NHS, which Labour called irresponsible, and there is about £13 billion more going into the NHS during this Parliament. We have also increased transparency to make sure that where there are isolated pockets of poor care, the Care Quality Commission can intervene and make recommendations to improve the quality of care for patients in those hospitals.	2015-02-24c.176.3	The extra NHS staff my hon Friend talks about are welcome, but my constituents want to know that standards of care are the best as well.

2015-02-24.1.0	My hon Friend is right to raise this important point. As part of our commitment to investing more money in the front line, we have been able to ensure that there are between 800 and 1,000 more doctors now working in A and E than under the Labour Government.	2015-02-24c.176.7	Can the Minister remind the House of the number of extra specialist A and E doctors working in the NHS in England now compared with 2010?	2015-02-24c.176.6	person/24741	person/24756	False	2015-02-24	cameron	False	False	0	Health	Health	Nhs Staff	2	conservative	True	False	conservative	True	False
2015-02-24.1.1	That is extraordinary. The Public Accounts Committee will be aware that these redundancy terms were introduced by the previous Labour Government in 2006. We are committed to changing them and I hope that the hon Lady’s party will support us in exerting pressure on the unions to support the pay deals on the table that will introduce an £80,000 redundancy cap.	2015-02-24c.177.1	Those of us on the Public Accounts Committee have heard about the industrial scale of this revolving door of people going out of one job and into another with a fat redundancy payment. Does this not show that the Government have lost their grip on what is truly important in the NHS, which is paying front-line clinicians to serve patients?	2015-02-24c.177.0	person/11605	person/24756	False	2015-02-24	cameron	False	False	0	Health	Health	Nhs Staff	1	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False
2015-02-24.3.0	There have always been parts of our health service where it has been difficult to attract GPs to work; that is a long-standing problem. A new £10 million investment fund has been put in place, and a new 10-point plan is being delivered by NHS England to look at how we can better incentivise younger doctors to work in areas in which it has traditionally been difficult to recruit. I am sure that that will bring benefits to the hon Gentleman’s constituency and elsewhere in the NHS.	2015-02-24c.178.0	I am told that many young doctors are choosing not to go into general practice. That, coupled with the number of retiring GPs, is leading to real shortages in places such as Clacton. What more can be done to make general practice more attractive to young doctors, in order to offset the number of GPs who are retiring?	2015-02-24c.177.8	person/11621	person/24756	True	2015-02-24	cameron	False	False	0	Health	Health	Gp Retirement	0	ukip	False	False	conservative	True	False
2015-02-24.3.1	My right hon Friend asks an important question. We can of course support the existing model, and the innovation that comes with GPs being small businesses, and that is exactly what we are doing with the £1 billion investment fund for GP infrastructure and technology. We are supporting those GPs as small businesses to develop better patient services.	2015-02-24c.178.2	Does my hon Friend agree that this is not just a matter of the total number of GPs? Quite a lot of GPs now want to work part time, and quite a lot now want to be salaried rather than being partners. Is he confident that the model that was set up in 1948, which effectively means that each GP practice is its own separate, private business, is still suitable in the 21st century?	2015-02-24c.178.1	person/10023	person/24756	False	2015-02-24	cameron	False	False	0	Health	Health	Gp Retirement	0	conservative	True	False	conservative	True	False
2015-02-24.3.2	It has always been the case—it was certainly the case among many of my medical contemporaries—that many people from our NHS go and work overseas for some time. They often come back to the NHS, bringing broader experience and skills. As I outlined earlier, there are now 1,000 more GPs working and training in our NHS than there were five years ago.	2015-02-24c.178.4	On what is his last outing, will the Minister tell us how many GPs, in addition to those who have retired, have left the profession and how many have gone to work abroad?	2015-02-24c.178.3	person/24852	person/24756	False	2015-02-24	cameron	False	False	0	Health	Health	Gp Retirement	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False
2015-02-24.3.3	I am sure that my hon Friend will understand that it is difficult for me to comment on an individual case, but I am very happy to look into the matter and get back to him about it.	2015-02-24c.178.6	Following the retirement of a senior partner whom it has been impossible to replace, Dr Hadrian Moss of the Dryland GP surgery in Kettering has followed the advice of the British Medical Association and informally closed his expanded list of 2,500 patients on the ground of patient safety. He has now been taken to task by NHS England for a potential breach of contract. What is the Minister’s opinion on reconciling the views of the BMA on patient safety guidelines and those of NHS England on a potential breach of contract?	2015-02-24c.178.5	person/11661	person/24756	False	2015-02-24	cameron	False	False	0	Health	Health	Gp Retirement	0	conservative	True	False	conservative	True	False
2015-02-24.3.4	There is a lot of work going on in this area. First, we are encouraging and supporting GPs who have had career breaks, perhaps because they have started a family, to get back into the profession more easily than they have been able to do in the past. Secondly, we also have the commitment that 50% of medical students and doctors leaving foundation training will become GPs in future. That will make sure that we have 5,000 more GPs by 2020.	2015-02-24c.179.0	Given that the needs of patients must come first and that young people are not choosing to pursue GP training as much as they used to, what discussions will the Secretary of State hold directly with the British Medical Association, the Royal Colleges, the training councils and his colleagues in the devolved Administrations throughout the UK to address this issue, to prevent further congestion in accident and emergency departments?	2015-02-24c.178.7	person/13856	person/24756	False	2015-02-24	cameron	False	False	0	Health	Health	Gp Retirement	0	social-democratic-and-labour-party	False	False	conservative	True	False
2015-02-24.3.5	I know that the Labour party is full of professional politicians, but medical students do not just leave medical school and straight away become GPs; they become foundation doctors. As I have outlined, 50% of the people leaving their foundation training will become GPs in future, which will increase the number of GPs by 5,000. Under this Government the number of GPs in education, training and working in the NHS has increased by 1,000, which is a move in the right direction.	2015-02-24c.179.2	But the Government’s reorganisation took billions of pounds away from the NHS front line. Figures released last week show that fewer than a quarter of medical students now enter general practice, because they can see the pressure that Ministers have put on it, while GP morale has collapsed. Should the Minister not now admit that the reorganisation was a mistake and instead match Labour’s pledge to invest an extra £2.5 billion a year to recruit 8,000 more GPs and guarantee appointments within 48 hours?	2015-02-24c.179.1	person/11531	person/24756	False	2015-02-24	cameron	False	False	0	Health	Health	Gp Retirement	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False
2015-02-24.4.0	My hon Friend is absolutely right to say that diagnostics play a key role in our drive to improve cancer survival, which is why we have committed £750 million to deliver our cancer strategy, including £450 million to achieve better diagnosis of cancer, and better awareness and access to diagnostic tests. Projections show that that is working; we are on track to see 12,000 more cancer patients a year surviving for at least five years in 2015, which is more than double the target of 5,000 we set ourselves in January 2011. I hope that the Labour party will agree that these are real benefits for cancer patients in the NHS today.	2015-02-24c.179.7	I welcome those fantastic figures at the Countess of Chester hospital. Will the Minister confirm that early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for dealing with many conditions, and that we are seeing the results of that in improved survival rates for conditions such as cancer?	2015-02-24c.179.6	person/24750	person/24817	True	2015-02-24	cameron	False	False	0	Health	Health	Countess Of Chester Hospital (Scans)	0	conservative	True	False	conservative	True	False
2015-02-24.4.1	I admire the hon Gentleman’s chutzpah but it ill behoves him to talk to us about privatisation; it was his party that led to the increases and it is this Government who have stopped it, and he needs to acknowledge that. On the facts, in December the NHS in England performed more than 130,000 more diagnostic tests compared with December 2013. I note that he did not talk about Wales, where 24% of patients have waited more than eight weeks for their diagnostic test—the comparative figure is 2% of patients in England.	2015-02-24c.180.2	Cancer scanning services in Cheshire and Staffordshire have recently been subjected to a competitive tendering process, and the contract was awarded to Alliance Medical, despite its bid being £7 million more expensive than the NHS bid. Can the Secretary of State explain why the more expensive private sector bid was chosen over the better value NHS bid to provide these services? Will he commit to investigating the bidding process to ensure that the tender was conducted fairly? [Interruption.] He is chuntering from a sedentary position, but will he today confirm, because this is a matter of profound public interest, that no contact of any sort took place between his Department and the board of Alliance Medical with regard to this decision, including at any point with the current board member, the right hon and learned Member for Kensington (Sir Malcolm Rifkind) ?	2015-02-24c.180.0	person/11511	person/24817	False	2015-02-24	cameron	False	False	0	Health	Health	Countess Of Chester Hospital (Scans)	2	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False
2015-02-24.5.0	That is absolutely right. What is said by everyone who has been wrestling with this problem about why our survival rates are not as good as we want is that early diagnosis and access to the latest drugs are the two critical things. My hon Friend will be pleased that 9,000 people in his region have accessed the cancer drugs fund and that, in his constituency, 300 more people every year are now being treated for cancer than was the case four years ago.	2015-02-24c.181.0	"I thank the Secretary of State for his response. Last year, I met cancer patients and carers with the aim of looking at how we can improve cancer survival rates so that they are among the best in western Europe. The main observation was that early diagnosis is key. Does my right hon Friend agree that it is
absolutely crucial that we support GPs to find and identify the early signs and symptoms of cancer so that we can improve survival rates?"	2015-02-24c.180.9	person/24886	person/11859	True	2015-02-24	cameron	False	False	0	Health	Health	Cancer Survival	0	conservative	True	False	conservative	True	False
2015-02-24.5.1	We absolutely can. In fact, we are carrying out about half a million more diagnostic tests for cancer every year than we were four years ago. The result is that, over the course of this Parliament, 700,000 more people are being admitted for cancer treatment in our hospitals than was the case in the previous Parliament, saving 12,000 lives every year.	2015-02-24c.181.2	The excellent progress made in cancer survival rates is great news across the UK and in my constituency in Fylde. A lot of that is down to the increase in availability of diagnostic tests. Statistics from Blackpool’s NHS trust show that just under 33,000 more diagnostic tests were carried out in 2014 compared with 2010. With that in mind, will my right hon Friend commit to increasing the availability of diagnostic tests?	2015-02-24c.181.1	person/24804	person/11859	True	2015-02-24	cameron	False	False	0	Health	Health	Cancer Survival	0	conservative	True	False	conservative	True	False
2015-02-24.5.2	Absolutely. It was a fantastic development for Worcestershire Royal hospital. My hon Friend campaigned very hard for it, and it is fantastic for his constituents. Cancer treatment is expensive, which is why we can only fund developments in cancer if we have a strong economy. That is what this Government are committed to doing for our NHS.	2015-02-24c.181.4	I welcome the Secretary of State’s answers. Improvements in radiotherapy have been a key factor in improving cancer survival rates and quality of life for patients. This month, Worcestershire is celebrating the delivery of a state of the art radiotherapy centre at Worcestershire Royal hospital. I visited that £25 million oncology centre last week. With some of the most advanced equipment in the country and eight new consultants recently recruited, does my right hon Friend agree that the centre will be a key asset in taking forward the fight against cancer?	2015-02-24c.181.3	person/24862	person/11859	True	2015-02-24	cameron	False	False	0	Health	Health	Cancer Survival	0	conservative	True	False	conservative	True	False
2015-02-24.5.3	Let me reassure the hon Gentleman that we are absolutely committed to furthering and improving peer review as a way of winning the battle against cancer. The NHS is committed to that programme, and it is just looking at how it can be improved.	2015-02-24c.181.6	May I draw the Secretary of State’s attention to an excellent debate we had in the Chamber on 5 February under the auspices of the all-party group on cancer? May I also draw his attention to the uncertainty surrounding the funding of the national cancer peer review group programme? That programme has recently been reviewed and the Minister had indicated that the funding would continue. Will he take the opportunity to give a commitment to funding that peer review group, because there seems to be some doubt among the 17 national cancer charities that support its work.	2015-02-24c.181.5	person/24715	person/11859	False	2015-02-24	cameron	False	False	0	Health	Health	Cancer Survival	1	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False

We are carrying out 21,000 more diagnostic tests, including cancer tests, every year compared with four years ago, and I hope that that is something the hon Gentleman will welcome.	2015-02-24c.182.2	On the early detection of cancer, will the Secretary of State consider putting more resources into socially deprived areas such as Halton where the incidence of cancer is higher?	2015-02-24c.182.1	person/10610	person/11859	False	2015-02-24	cameron	False	False	0	Health	Health	Cancer Survival	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False
2015-02-24.5.5	I congratulate my hon Friend on his understanding of the importance of transparency. He will welcome the fact that we are now saving 1,000 more lives a month as a result of focusing on the five-year survival rates. But that transparency must apply to CCGs as well, and discussions are ongoing with NHS England as to the best way to do that for lots of things, including cancer.	2015-02-24c.182.4	The all-party group on cancer and the wider cancer community have commended the Government on introducing the one-year survival rates for cancer into the delivery dashboard from April of this year as a means of driving forward earlier diagnosis. But what can the Secretary of State tell us about the work that is being undertaken to ensure that the levers of accountability are in place to push under-performing clinical commissioning groups into raising their standards on behalf of patients?	2015-02-24c.182.3	person/10715	person/11859	False	2015-02-24	cameron	False	False	0	Health	Health	Cancer Survival	0	conservative	True	False	conservative	True	False
2015-02-24.5.6	I do not disagree with it, but I will tell the hon Lady why we are missing that one target. Incidentally, we are hitting the seven other targets. We are treating and diagnosing so many more people, with 560,000 more diagnoses every year. That means that in this Parliament we are treating 700,000 more people than were treated in Labour’s last Parliament, saving 1,000 more lives a month. If the hon Lady looks at some of the other things that Cancer Research UK says, she will see that they welcome that strongly.	2015-02-24c.182.6	"Last week, we learned that the 62-day target for cancer treatment has been missed for a full 12 months:
‘This isn’t just about missed targets–consecutive breaches mean thousands of patients are being failed. These targets exist to ensure swift diagnosis of cancer and access to treatment, which is vital if we’re serious about having the best survival rates in the world.”
Those are not my words; they are an exact quote from Cancer Research UK. Which bit of it does the Secretary of State disagree with?"	2015-02-24c.182.5	person/24816	person/11859	False	2015-02-24	cameron	False	False	0	Health	Health	Cancer Survival	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False
2015-02-24.6.0	I thank my hon Friend for that question and join her in paying tribute to the work of so many people: volunteers, loved ones and the professionals working in the community. The whole emphasis should be on ensuring that we respect people’s choice about where they want to be and that they get the best possible care. Later this week, the independent review of choice at the end of life will be published and I hope that it will inform discussions. I am completely with her in trying to ensure that we can achieve this.	2015-02-24c.183.2	I thank the Minister for that reply. He will know that most people want to be able to remain at home at the end of their lives, surrounded by the people they love, and I pay tribute to all the carers, volunteers and health professionals, including Rowcroft’s hospice at home, who help to make that possible. Sadly, he will also know that often the situation can break down because of the sheer exhaustion of caring for a loved one at the end of their life. Will he commit that the Government will consider the quality of care as well as the costs when considering introducing free end-of-life social care?	2015-02-24c.183.1	person/24761	person/11032	True	2015-02-24	cameron	False	False	0	Health	Health	Free Social Care	0	conservative	True	False	liberal-democrat	False	False
2015-02-24.6.1	Actually, we are all agreed on this. We all want free care at the end of life, but whoever is in power after the election in May will have to ensure that we understand fully the costs. There is a lot of evidence, and the evidence is growing. We are having very good discussions with groups involved in care at the end of life and we all want to achieve a solution. Of course, the truth is that very many people are receiving free care at the end of life, but they are in hospital, where they often do not want to be. I am completely with the hon Lady in trying to achieve this.	2015-02-24c.183.4	One of my constituents recently went through a lengthy, distressing and difficult process to get NHS continuing care for his wife. If we remove the distinction between NHS and social care, many people across this country, including my constituent, will be spared this distress and difficulty at one of the hardest times in their lives. We know that funding should be put where it is needed and we know that that will be more cost-effective in the long run and will be better for patients, so why will the Minister not act?	2015-02-24c.183.3	person/24831	person/11032	False	2015-02-24	cameron	False	False	0	Health	Health	Free Social Care	0	labour	False	True	liberal-democrat	False	False

As I said earlier, we are in active discussions with these groups and I held a round table with them a few months ago to discuss how we can achieve this. Everyone is agreed on the objective, but we need to understand the full costs involved before any Government can make a commitment to it.	2015-02-24c.184.0	Eight out of 10 people say that they would prefer to die at home when their time comes. Since the Government published their White Paper and said that they saw merit in social care being free at the end of life, a succession of reports from Macmillan, Nuffield and others have shown that there are savings to be made and benefits in terms of more dignified deaths and compassion for families. Is it not time to act on the evidence and make social care free at the end of life?	2015-02-24c.183.5	person/10080	person/11032	False	2015-02-24	cameron	False	False	0	Health	Health	Free Social Care	0	liberal-democrat	False	False	liberal-democrat	False	False
2015-02-24.6.3	I am tempted to say that that is a bit rich coming from an Opposition Member. I am sure that he would agree that whatever commitments are made, we need to understand their cost. That work is under way and I hope that as soon as we achieve a full understanding we can proceed.	2015-02-24c.184.2	Is there not something deceitful about the Government’s promising major changes for the next Parliament when we do not know how they will be paid for? If we want improvements to the NHS and end-of-life care in the next Parliament, Members on both sides of the House need to put before the electorate how we will pay for those important long-term changes.	2015-02-24c.184.1	person/10197	person/11032	False	2015-02-24	cameron	False	False	0	Health	Health	Free Social Care	0	labour	False	True	liberal-democrat	False	False
2015-02-24.7.0	My hon Friend makes an excellent point. He is absolutely right: cancer is a genetic disease, and the more we know about genetics, the more we discover about different patients’ predisposition to different diseases and drugs. That is absolutely key, nowhere more clearly than in breast cancer, where the HER2-Herceptin breakthrough and the BRCA2 gene are allowing us better to screen, predict and target treatment of breast cancer, freeing women from the choice of mastectomy, which has been far too dominant, and enabling us to treat breast cancer as a preventable disease.	2015-02-24c.184.7	The number of people being treated for cancer successfully and getting appropriate diagnostic treatment in Dudley and Sandwell has increased substantially in the past five years, but does the Minister agree that harnessing genomic medicine is key to the future, and that we need to drive innovation in this field over the next 10, 20 and 30 years?	2015-02-24c.184.6	person/24855	person/24817	True	2015-02-24	cameron	False	False	0	Health	Health	Genomics Programme	0	conservative	True	False	conservative	True	False

In my view, it would be incredibly sad and very worrying if that service were to be lost. I am happy to invite the clinical commissioning group and the mental health trust to a meeting in the Department to discuss how it can be saved.	2015-02-24c.185.4	The Minister will be aware that although the NHS is one organisation, trusts seem to operate as silos.

2015-02-24.8.1	The local Members of the Youth Parliament the right hon Gentleman met make an incredibly important point. I refer him to the children and young people’s mental health and well-being taskforce, which will report very soon. I think that the role of schools will be crucial in its conclusions, and I encourage him to look at the report when it emerges.	2015-02-24c.185.6	I recently met the five UK Youth Parliament Members from Rotherham, who talked about the lack of facilities for mental health help in education, both further education and state education. May I say to the Minister that it is all right saying that it is up to local commissioning groups, but where is the leadership, when our young people are being left in extremely difficult situations and are seen by some professionals but, sadly, not health professionals?	2015-02-24c.185.5	person/10027	person/11032	False	2015-02-24	cameron	False	False	0	Health	Health	Mental Health	0	labour	False	True	liberal-democrat	False	False

These decisions are taken by local commissioners in local authorities and CCGs. Indeed, we have legislated for parity of esteem for mental health. I urge her to look
at the outcome of the work of the children and young people’s mental health and well-being taskforce, which I think gives us a real opportunity to improve the way in which services operate."	2015-02-24c.185.8	The latest figures show a huge rise in the number of young people with a mental illness turning up at A and E. Young people not getting the help they need early on and becoming so ill that they need hospital care shows that the system is failing. Does the Minister accept that this Government’s decision to cut children’s mental health services at the same time as wasting £3 billion on a reorganisation has been a key factor in that failure?	2015-02-24c.185.7	person/24924	person/11032	False	2015-02-24	cameron	False	False	0	Health	Health	Mental Health	0	labour	False	True	liberal-democrat	False	False
2015-02-24.9.0	They are in the monthly staff statistics survey. As the hon Gentleman would like some detailed information, I am sure he will be pleased to hear that in his constituency there are now 386 more nurses than there were in 2010 under the previous Government, and nationally there are 7,500 more nurses, midwives and health visitors working in the NHS.	2015-02-24c.186.4	In response to 11 parliamentary questions that I submitted in the past year, the Minister has admitted that he does not know how many part-time, agency and locum GPs are in the health service, the number of agency and part-time nurses, the number of part-time doctors in our hospitals, or how many working nurses and midwives are also drawing their pensions. Given that he has so little detail on staffing, where did today’s figures come from, and what faith can anyone have in them?	2015-02-24c.186.3	person/10377	person/24756	True	2015-02-24	cameron	False	False	0	Health	Health	Nurse Numbers	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False
2015-02-24.9.1	My hon Friend and I have discussed this many times and I do not agree with him, as he knows. What is important is that patients are assessed on their clinical needs. A rehabilitation ward will need a different number of nurses—indeed, it may need physiotherapists and occupational therapists—from intensive care nursing, which often requires one-to-one care, so setting arbitrary staffing ratios is not in the best interests of patients.	2015-02-24c.186.6	Does my hon Friend agree with me and with the nursing profession that if nurse staffing levels on acute hospital wards fall below one registered nurse to seven acutely ill patients, excluding the registered nurse in charge, it will significantly increase the risk to patient care and result in avoidable excess deaths?	2015-02-24c.186.5	person/10222	person/24756	False	2015-02-24	cameron	False	False	0	Health	Health	Nurse Numbers	0	liberal-democrat	False	False	conservative	True	False

She goes on to say that
“the financial challenge has reached unviable levels”
and that NHS providers
“can no longer guarantee sustainable and safe care”.

As I am sure we all agree, carers do wonderful work and need as much support as possible. Will my right hon Friend’s Department work with Sue Ryder and others to ensure that there is a dedicated 24/7 palliative care service, which would certainly help to take the strain away from A and E, which is already under great pressure?	2015-02-24c.189.0	person/11816	person/11032	True	2015-02-24	cameron	False	False	0	Health	Health	Palliative Care	0	conservative	True	False	liberal-democrat	False	False

He is right that local community hospitals can play a key role in supporting patient convalescence, providing particularly good care in the community close to home, which is convenient for elderly patients, and relieving pressure on acute hospital beds. You do not have to take it from me, Mr Speaker; take it from Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England. He recently said:
“A number of other countries have found it possible to run viable local hospitals serving smaller communities than sometimes we think are sustainable in the NHS…The NHS needs to abandon a fixation with ‘mass centralisation’”.
I hugely welcome that."	2015-02-24c.190.4	We have excellent hospitals in Tiverton, Honiton, Axminster and Seaton, and there could be a much greater link between them and the Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Foundation Trust.

However, I think it is very important that this is looked at closely in the light of the Francis report. If it is the case, as is said in media reports, that Professor Thomas has been forced to sign a confidentiality agreement—a so-called gagging order—I think that is disgraceful and shows a very dire state in the NHS in the Royal Marsden.

I wonder whether she saw the comments from the College of Emergency Medicine yesterday, which said that attempts to dissuade people from going to A and E have been a dismal failure and that what we should do is locate primary care services alongside A and E. That is the model we have at Charing Cross hospital and in the rest of west London, and it is succeeding. What is failing is the closure of emergency departments, which is creating an intolerable strain. Will the Government look again at the issue?

He tries to deny that it is happening on his watch, but we heard earlier about the ideological privatisation of cancer scanning in Cheshire and Staffordshire, despite its being more expensive than the NHS bid—and now it could get much worse. On the Friday before the recess, the Government sneaked out the public contracts regulations, which require NHS contracts worth over €750,000 to be opened up to full EU competition.

Now that the certificates are coming up for renewal, people are finding that they have to pay for their medicines once their certificate has expired, and they have even been fined.

1983-04-27.2.1	I must point out to the hon Gentleman and the Liberal party in Liverpool that Liverpool city council has been a conspicuous underspender. The crucial need in Liverpool is for full utilisation of the resources that have been made available. The Liverpool city council underspent in 1981–82 and it appears that it has produced an increased underspend in 1982–83. The local authority should make better use of its stock and full use of its resources.	1983-04-27a.848.6	Will the Minister confirm that the Government cut housing support in Liverpool by £7 million last year? Is he aware that until that is restored it will be impossible to do anything about many of the vacant dwellings?

1983-04-27.4.0	We took into account the views of the tenants expressed in the referendums before we announced our decision, but localised management accessible to the tenants is likely to be of a higher standard than remote management. Inevitably, when an estate is managed by an authority outside the local authority area in question, it is more likely to be remote, whereas if it is managed by the local authority in whose area it is situated, it can be more closely integrated with the other services that the local authority provides. For those two reasons, I believe that the decision was correct.	1983-04-27a.850.10	Why did the Department hold referendums in the Newham estates in Hutton and Elm Park, which produced overwhelming majorities to stay with Newham, only to ignore the results completely?

No one in the House should be in any doubt about the serious threat that would arise to organised cricket if a tour of South. Africa were to go ahead by the MCC, which is technically a private club. It was at the ICC that the MCC and its governing body, the Cricket Council, voted 13 years ago to exclude South Africa from the cricket itinerary.	1983-04-27a.856.0	"In view of the contribution that sport makes to international relationships and understanding, does my hon Friend agree that it would be traumatic, both for world sport and for Commonwealth sporting relationships, if a shortsighted decision were to be made, which would lead to England playing South Africa at cricket?

Furthermore, is it not a fact that if that were to happen all the other members of the International Cricket Conference would not follow our example, so that we would be left playing South Africa and South Africa alone, which would be very tedious?"	1983-04-27a.855.9	person/22118	person/21735	True	1983-04-27	thatcher	False	False	0	Oral Answers To Questions	Oral Answers To Questions	Multiracial Sport	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1983-04-27.9.1	Somehow I feel that this important subject has been deflected by the hon Gentleman. I wish that he would take a closer interest in these important matters. The fact is that Her Majesty's Government acknowledge the principle of the Commonwealth statement on apartheid in sport, which was upheld in 1979 and 1981. There is no deviation from that concept.	1983-04-27a.856.2	Is this not an area where the Minister can usefully intervene and give guidance? Are there not many more areas in sport where help is very much needed at present? Would not the Minister's time be better spent on those functions rather than being turned into a children's nursemaid, which is the function that the Prime Minister seems to have in mind for him?	1983-04-27a.856.1	person/22158	person/21735	False	1983-04-27	thatcher	False	False	0	Oral Answers To Questions	Oral Answers To Questions	Multiracial Sport	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1983-04-27.9.2	I do not have quite the amount of time that my hon Friend has to visit South Africa. My hon Friends from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office undertake visits to South Africa. That is not part of my locus. I am certain that my hon Friend does not wish to mislead the House. There was no ICC-ratified visit to South Africa in 1979. The ICC voted to exclude South Africa from its cricketing itinerary in 1969. The visit about 10 years later was not an ICC visit. Some people went to South Africa who happened to be representatives of the ICC.	1983-04-27a.856.4	I take up the point that my hon Friend made about the ICC. May I point out to him that the ICC went to South Africa in 1979 on a fact-finding mission and came back with a recommendation that an ICC team be sent to South Africa because of what it had seen? If my hon Friend is so desirous, as I hope he is, of representing the interests of British sportsmen, will he go to South Africa to see for himself that sport is not organised on the basis of race, colour or ethnic origin? By seeing that for himself he will not have to rely, as he said on Radio 4 the other evening, on pictures and newspaper reports.	1983-04-27a.856.3	person/16897	person/21735	False	1983-04-27	thatcher	False	False	0	Oral Answers To Questions	Oral Answers To Questions	Multiracial Sport	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

Will the Minister extend that thinking to Rugby Football Union? Does he agree that if the Rugby Football Union authorities are considering a public tour of the South Africa Rugby Union in two years'


time in exchange for an agreement by Dr. Craaven of South Africa not to let his private tour take place this year, that would be equally reprehensible?"	1983-04-27a.856.5	person/21743	person/21735	False	1983-04-27	thatcher	False	False	0	Oral Answers To Questions	Oral Answers To Questions	Multiracial Sport	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

I recognise that there is a considerable burden of work, but most local authorities are deploying existing staff to that work.	1983-04-27a.859.7	Is the Minister aware that there is public concern in some areas about increasing delays by local authorities in processing applications for improvement grants?

1983-04-27.13.0	The notional annual salary is a full-time figure. The actual appointment for Yorkshire is for three days per week, so the pay taken is substantially less than the figure to which the hon Gentleman referred. As for comparibility with other public service posts, such as that of chief constable, that is hardly a matter for me. I should point out, however, that the Yorkshire water authority provides a vital service to a region far larger than that presided over by the chief constable of west Yorkshire.	1983-04-27a.860.0	"I thank the hon Gentleman for that answer. Does he recall that in his reply of 15 April he stated that

the notional full-time pay of the chairman of the Yorkshire water authority was more than £29,000 pensionable income, plus perks?

That is the long-hallowed responsibility of the district auditor. I am aware, however, that enterprises are now being undertaken by local authorities that are a total abuse of what local authorities in the past would have considered to be the proper use of their funds. This raises very serious issues and, as I said yesterday, I am considering the matter.	1983-04-27a.861.2	Is the Secretary of State aware that some Labour-controlled authorities in London are still keen to use public funds to finance a Labour local authority association? Is he aware that, having been advised that it is not legal to do that explicitly, they are now building conditions into the constitution of the new association about, for example, the abolition or not of the GLC so as to ensure that only Labour authorities are likely to join the association?

Is he aware that, faced with the choice between an elected authority or a non-elected quango, or arm of central Government, many of us prefer on balance to retain an elected regional authority?	1983-04-27a.861.5	person/22600	person/10342	False	1983-04-27	thatcher	False	False	0	Oral Answers To Questions	Oral Answers To Questions	Greater London Council	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

Ultimately, however, it is for local authorities to decide what needs to meet.	1983-04-27a.863.1	Will the Minister confirm that, during the past 12 months, there has been a significant increase in the number of people who have transferred to solid fuel? Does he agree that one of the problems that people often face when installing new appliances is that they are unable to burn solid fuel because of the misguided policy of local authorities not to build chimneys? As there are 50 million tonnes of coal on the ground, some of which can be used for domestic purposes, and since there is a 300 years' supply of coal underground and a limited supply of other fossil fuels, why does he not review his decision and encourage local authorities to take the action that I have suggested?	1983-04-27a.863.0	person/10544	person/10659	True	1983-04-27	thatcher	False	False	0	Oral Answers To Questions	Oral Answers To Questions	Solid Fuel	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

1983-04-27.17.0	I do not agree. The House debated the subject at great length in 1980. If one examines the relative incomes of different tenure groups, one finds, for example, that the average income of tenants who rent in the private sector are somewhat lower than the income of those who rent in the public sector, yet the former are ratepayers. We give councillors discretion about making transfers from the general rate fund to the housing revenue account and the House has taken the view that we can give them the same discretion to make a reverse transfer if they believe it is reasonable to do so.	1983-04-27a.863.8	Does the Minister agree that it is grossly inequitable to transfer funds from council tenants to the general body of ratepayers when the average income of council tenants is lower than that of owner-occupiers?	1983-04-27a.863.7	person/10171	person/10563	True	1983-04-27	thatcher	False	False	0	Oral Answers To Questions	Oral Answers To Questions	General Rate Fund	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

1983-04-27.17.2	I am delighted to hear of the right hon Gentleman's anxiety about council tenants as ratepayers. That is not exhibited by the level of rates levied by many Labour authorities. As to assistance for council tenants, I remind the right hon Gentleman that more than half of all local authority tenants receive subtantial help with their rents through the rent rebate and supplementary benefit systems.	1983-04-27a.864.1	Is it not a fact that, this year, the Government have planned for £2,500 million in tax relief for people who are buying their houses on a mortgage, while housing subsidies have been reduced to £370 million. Is it not also the case that not only do council house tenants pay rent, which has increased by 134 per cent. under this Government, but they pay rates like everyone else? Therefore, is it not intolerable for the Government to force council house tenants to subsidise the rates of people whose incomes are 20 per cent. higher than theirs?	1983-04-27a.864.0	person/10327	person/10563	False	1983-04-27	thatcher	False	False	0	Oral Answers To Questions	Oral Answers To Questions	General Rate Fund	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

Much extra money is being spent and we should like to see further progress with standards.	1995-02-13a.645.9	Does my right hon Friend agree that those are impressive increases in expenditure per pupil in primary schools in Wales?

Will the Secretary of State turn his attention to one specific matter affecting the education of primary school children in Wales? Large parts of Wales now have access to S4C, Welsh-speaking television, but not to Channel 4, including its educational programmes. That is a big issue in Gwent, including in Islwyn.

1995-02-13.0.2	That long speech fell flat. In 1991–92, there were 26,633 teachers in Wales and in 1993–94 there were 26,752—an increase. Every year, the Labour party—through its councils and in the House—has threatened big cuts in teacher numbers. I am not cutting expenditure. I asked the House to approve increased money for Welsh local government and it did so on 8 February. The hon Gentleman cannot produce a single shadow pound over and above my settlement.	1995-02-13a.646.1	I suspect that the party of the hon Member for Southwark and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes)—the Liberal Democrat party—has a slightly greater interest in Islwyn than the Secretary of State's party. Given the increase in school numbers of a further 8,000 pupils next year, why has the Secretary of State cut expenditure on education? He has made a complete shambles of the local government settlement. He is browbeating education authorities to spend their balances when each and every one of them is doing just that to protect their education services. He is bullying schools about their balances when all they are doing is following the Government's instructions. Is it not now clear that enormous damage is being done throughout our education service in Wales—teachers are protesting, pupils are protesting, parents are protesting, governors are protesting and politicians are protesting? Is it just the Secretary of State's arrogance that makes him believe that everyone else is wrong and he alone is right?	1995-02-13a.646.0	person/10161	person/10499	False	1995-02-13	major	False	False	0	Wales	Wales	Primary Schools	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1995-02-13.0.3	I join my hon Friend in welcoming traditional methods. I think that too much child-centred learning spoils the child and spoils results. I fear, however, that we have a long way to go in Wales, as in England, in raising standards generally. The pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools has remained the same—22.3—since 1988–89, so there is no evidence of massive cuts in teachers. I hope that governors support them, and that they all get on with the job of raising standards.	1995-02-13a.646.3	Does my hon Friend accept that what matters most is outcomes in education? Does he agree that outcomes in education in Wales are exceptionally good, particularly compared with those in England? Is that not a result of the methods used in Wales, which are often not child-centred or project teaching but whole-class teaching and more traditional methods? Would he recommend those methods to some of our English schools?	1995-02-13a.646.2	person/11245	person/10499	False	1995-02-13	major	False	False	0	Wales	Wales	Primary Schools	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1995-02-13.1.0	I think that the hon Gentleman has probably switched his question. I imagine that he originally intended to ask about the police—a big increase in the settlement took care of that problem—but he is wrong in what he said. There is money in the settlement to pay for good teachers and to meet the increase in teachers' pay that we have accepted from the recommendations of the review body. I identified in the debate a number of ways in which that money can be found, not only from balances in schools, and the hon Gentleman should remember that the total settlement approved was £87 million higher than in the current year.	1995-02-13a.647.0	"Is the Secretary of State aware that his claim that schools can meet the teachers' pay rise from their accumulated balances is completely without foundation? Is he aware that this morning I spoke to head teachers of secondary schools in my constituency, each of


whom said that they would be unable to meet the pay rise without cutting staff and equipment budgets and, in some cases, going into deficit? Does he now accept the argument of the Secretary of State for Education: that unless the teachers' pay rise is fully funded by central Government, it will be disastrous for the education service?"	1995-02-13a.646.7	person/10004	person/10499	True	1995-02-13	major	False	False	0	Wales	Wales	Local Government Finance	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1995-02-13.1.1	My right hon Friend is right. There are balances in the counties and in the schools, and an extra £600 million, or 30 per cent., has been made available since 1991, which is well above the inflation rate.	1995-02-13a.647.2	Will my right hon Friend confirm that, as a result of good settlements in previous years, most local authorities have accumulated substantial balances, which, along with aggregate Exchequer grant, should be very helpful to them?	1995-02-13a.647.1	person/21902	person/10499	False	1995-02-13	major	False	False	0	Wales	Wales	Local Government Finance	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1995-02-13.2.0	The hon Gentleman is right that there is a worrying drugs problem. The Welsh Office is co-ordinating work on how best to tackle it. The £15 million extra for the police, in addition to the original settlement proposals, is very helpful in that respect. I should like to pay tribute to the excellent work of the north Wales police in relation to the Owens family. I am sure that the whole House will join me in saying that we are delighted that the family is reunited and that we are grateful to the police and the medical staff who helped.	1995-02-13a.647.7	I readily acknowledge that the recent settlement is a great improvement for policing. I accept that it is an improvement in north Wales, and that it has been acknowledged to be so. I remind the Minister, however, that, unfortunately, there is a great and increasing drugs problem in Wales, and the police officers with whom I spoke recently said that tackling it is beyond their current resources. It behoves the Welsh Office to take a strategic approach to that increasing problem, and to give some direction for police officers to follow?	1995-02-13a.647.6	person/10368	person/10499	True	1995-02-13	major	False	False	0	Wales	Wales	Police Funding	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1995-02-13.2.1	My hon Friend is quite right. I had wanted local government to do the decent thing by the police; it had plenty of money to do so, but it chose to spend it on other things, so, with regret, I took the matter out of its hands. The House approved my proposals, which will lead to many more policemen on the beat, especially in south Wales, but perhaps throughout Wales. I think that is what the public want.	1995-02-13a.648.0	"Will my right hon Friend note the considerable relief and pleasure in the Vale of Glamorgan

I freely accept that it was uncomfortable for me to defend for many months the proposition that Labour local government should do the decent thing and give the right answers when the House had voted freely to make the money available. Local government refused to give that money to the police and wasted it on other things. That is the scandal and I am glad that we have resolved it—although I wish that local authorities had resolved it themselves.	1995-02-13a.648.2	Does not the Secretary of State recognise that everyone will regard his regret as lacking in sincerity? The funding shortfall for the police force in Wales—particularly South Wales police—is due to the failure of the Secretary of State and his colleague the Home Secretary to provide the money. Is it not curious that this year, when the need to set an SSA has forced clarity into the allocation of funds, he has finally come up with the money that we have been telling him to allocate for two years?	1995-02-13a.648.1	person/10431	person/10499	False	1995-02-13	major	False	False	0	Wales	Wales	Police Funding	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

That is why we get more than our fair share of inward investment into the Community and why we wish to carry on in that happy state.	1995-02-13a.648.7	Wales has always had a good inward investment record that is envied by all.

We obviously do not think that it would damage our inward investment prospects during that time, and that is the Government's clear decision.	1995-02-13a.649.2	Does my right hon Friend think it likely that Britain's failure to participate in a single European currency will threaten the flow of inward investment into Wales?	1995-02-13a.649.1	person/10312	person/10499	False	1995-02-13	major	False	False	0	Wales	Wales	Inward Investment	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1995-02-13.3.3	I am very happy with the leadership that the Prime Minister has offered in his speeches and interviews on the subject, which made the situation absolutely crystal clear. The hon Gentleman will be pleased to know that it is certainly not putting off inward investors. For example, Ringtel, the first serious Taiwanese investor in 'Wales, announced today that it will create 100 jobs. I hope that he welcomes that news. It shows that inward investors do not take what is written in the newspapers as seriously as Labour Members. Investors recognise that Britain is the right place in which to invest and that we have the right policy for trade with Europe and the rest of the world.	1995-02-13a.649.4	Does not the Secretary of State recognise that the continuing deep Cabinet split over the issue of a single currency is extremely damaging to the future of inward investment in Wales? Does the right hon Gentleman agree with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who said that it is quite possible to have monetary union without political union, or will he follow the Euro-sceptic line in Wales, wrap himself in the Union Jack and totally disregard our needs?	1995-02-13a.649.3	person/10320	person/10499	False	1995-02-13	major	False	False	0	Wales	Wales	Inward Investment	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

I am much in favour of that, as I trust are Opposition Members.	1995-02-13a.649.6	What will be the impact on inward investment from Europe, now that the United Kingdom, which is supposed to be united, is governed by a Tory party that is clearly disunited? The Secretary of State has come out blatantly as a member of the anti-Europe party within the Cabinet and has made clear his visceral antipathy to anything European—even European investment in Wales.	1995-02-13a.649.5	person/10443	person/10499	False	1995-02-13	major	False	False	0	Wales	Wales	Inward Investment	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

All are important to our security and trading prospects, and we must get the best from them by negotiating for Britain in the right way. Many Opposition Members would give in before negotiating. We want to stand up for Britain and get the right deal, so that inward investors still come to us.	1995-02-13a.650.2	Is it not also crucial that the Americans and Japanese see Britain as a continuing member of the European Union? When the Secretary of State is ready to parade his anti-European prejudices, would it not be helpful if he paused and reflected on that fact and perhaps bit his tongue?	1995-02-13a.650.1	person/10011	person/10499	False	1995-02-13	major	False	False	0	Wales	Wales	Inward Investment	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1995-02-13.4.0	I am grateful for the hon Gentleman's welcome, although my announcement is not new.

I do not know of any evidence to suggest that any Welsh interest has been disadvantaged.	1995-02-13a.650.7	I am delighted to hear that news. In England, the Department of the Environment issued PPG 13, which was a major step forward in strategic planning, in March 1994, but a vacuum has been created in Wales by the Welsh Office?

Why is the Welsh Office in effect acting illegally, in failing to apply planning guidance on the EU habitats directive? Is

As AWE has announced a 15 per cent. reduction in its work force across Britain and a 100 per cent. reduction in its work force in Wales, how does the Minister intend to advance the cause of Wales against that bias in defence-related industries? Another topical issue is the official service residences, over which Sir Sandy Wilson has recently got into hot water. There are 78 such residences throughout the world, yet not one in Wales.

1995-02-13.7.0	My hon Friend is absolutely right.

Those trends are supported by British chambers of commerce, Dun and Bradstreet and Touche Ross.	1995-02-13a.652.4	I thank my hon Friend for that answer, which will be welcomed by everyone, except the professional pessimists on the Opposition Benches.

That unit cost some £800,000 to set up. I have with me a glossy leaflet put out by the Clwyd welfare rights unit and published quarterly by Clwyd county council. It describes these seven employees as the Magnificent Seven, and goes on to say: You may have bumped into some of the new officers when they recently took part in a treasure hunt to acquaint themselves with their new surroundings"". I think that will suffice."	1995-02-13a.652.6	Given the well-established link between unemployment and poverty, will the Minister comment on yet another report which shows that, under his Government, the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer? The top tenth of the population are now 60 per cent. better off than they were in 1979, while the bottom tenth of the population are 17 per cent. worse off than they were in 1979.

In Caerleon there are Roman baths and barracks.

Of course the Government believe that there are things that can be done under existing programmes. That is why we have a strong programme of energy efficiency measures, which produce work in the public and private sectors. That is very welcome.

1995-02-13.14.0	That is not dissimilar from other questions from the hon Lady and, indeed, from some Labour Members. Whereas of course I agree with the first part of the hon Lady's question—about the importance of that research—the fact is that the freedom of the Medical Research Council to determine how best to commit its money and to decide which projects are backed has served it well for 80 years, and I do not intend to change from that.	1995-02-13a.657.2	Is the Minister aware that more funding needs to be given to core research into environmental control systems, which will enable disabled people with very limited muscular movement to switch on gadgets with a minimum of effort? Can he tell me whether the Office of Science and Technology is prepared to put funding into that?	1995-02-13a.657.1	person/18209	<UNKNOWN>	True	1995-02-13	major	False	False	0	Cabinet Office	Duchy Of Lancaster	Disabled People	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False			
1995-02-13.14.1	Yes, indeed. Also being a Member of Parliament for a constituency in north-west London, I recognise the very high reputation of Brunel university. It has had that reputation for a long time. The work is important, because we all know how it can transform the lives of people with disabilities, and it is important that as much money as possible goes into that research.	1995-02-13a.657.4	Can my hon Friend confirm that there is very valuable research into assistance and aid systems for disabled people at the Brunel university, which is in the constituency of my hon Friend the Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Shersby), and that it is low in cost and valuable in terms of production? Will my hon Friend do all he can to encourage it?	1995-02-13a.657.3	person/22587	<UNKNOWN>	False	1995-02-13	major	False	False	0	Cabinet Office	Duchy Of Lancaster	Disabled People	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False			
1995-02-13.14.2	One thing has always been clear to me in terms of issues related to people with disabilities: playing to the gallery does them no good whatever. What is more important than that is that, last month, the Department of Health announced a new programme—Medlink—amounting to £8.5 million over five years, with the same amount being matched to that from industry. That is the sort of thing that helps, not the empty rhetoric that we have just heard.	1995-02-13a.657.6	I am sure that we all agree that there is no better way to promote a positive understanding of the need for basic research in science and for technological development than improving the quality of lives for people with disabilities. Professor Stephen Hawking is an eloquent testimony to the best technology in the service of people with disabilities. While the Minister proclaims that that work is important, are not reductions in the Department of Health's budget for near market research, which could enable people to hear, see and move better—not to mention the blocking of the Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill—undermining his best efforts? Where is the Government's overall strategy in that respect?	1995-02-13a.657.5	person/10028	<UNKNOWN>	False	1995-02-13	major	False	False	0	Cabinet Office	Duchy Of Lancaster	Disabled People	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False			
1995-02-13.15.0	It is not for me to criticise the nature of the hon Gentleman's question; I must simply answer it. As for the hon Gentleman's supplementary questions, he will know that I announced the allocations for the various research councils only a few days ago, in our debate on science. Of course I am strongly committed to maintaining the necessary spending on basic research. It may assist the hon Gentleman to know that, in 1992–93, 47.4 per cent. of OPSS-funded research and development expenditure went on basic research.	1995-02-13a.658.4	I am afraid that that is not particularly helpful. Can the Chancellor guarantee that money for basic research will be made available to each research council; that he has no plans to reduce either the total or the individual amounts made available to research councils for that purpose in the next financial year; and that an appropriate amount of consultation is taking place between his Department, the research councils and the research institutions in regard to basic research?	1995-02-13a.658.3	person/10250	person/21733	True	1995-02-13	major	False	False	0	Cabinet Office	Duchy Of Lancaster	Research Council Expenditure	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1995-02-13.15.1	I not only confirm the statistics given by my hon Friend, but take this opportunity to congratulate him personally on the extensive representations that he makes on behalf of the five research councils situated in his constituency. It is indeed a fact that, in 1992–93, 92.3 per cent. of the research and development element of the science budget was directed towards curiosity-driven research. As I have said, 47.4 per cent. of the budget was spent on basic research; 44.9 per cent. was spent on strategic research. That is an important investment for the future of the United Kingdom.	1995-02-13a.658.6	Is it not a fact that there has been a real-terms increase of 30 per cent. in the science budget since 1979? Is it not also a fact that more than 92 per cent. of the science research councils' budget goes on research, whether basic or strategic? Is this not a good opportunity for my right hon Friend to join me in congratulating the staff of the research councils whose headquarters are in my constituency on the excellent value for money that they provide in administering their budgets?	1995-02-13a.658.5	person/17034	person/21733	False	1995-02-13	major	False	False	0	Cabinet Office	Duchy Of Lancaster	Research Council Expenditure	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

1995-02-13.16.1	The hon Lady has asked a compendium of questions. We regard chemistry as extremely important. That is one of the reasons why we were anxious to increase the amount of money made available to the relevant research council. As for education, the fact that science plays a large part in the national curriculum changes the nature of the facilities needed in schools. There is a large programme of refurbishing science laboratories and adding them to schools, and I have no doubt that that will continue.	1995-02-13a.659.2	Does the Minister not share the concerns of the Royal Society of Chemistry about, for example, the deterioration in university chemistry laboratories, which is preventing students and researchers from reaching their full potential? Science education will be hampered both by that difficulty at university level and by the pending increase in class sizes at school level. Surely the problem will not solve itself. What discussions is the Minister entering into with the Secretary of State for Education, as a matter of urgency, to ensure that the difficulties are tackled and chemistry can continue to maximise its role in the interests of the British economy?	1995-02-13a.659.1	person/10584	<UNKNOWN>	False	1995-02-13	major	False	False	0	Cabinet Office	Duchy Of Lancaster	Chemistry	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

Would it not be far better to improve the morale of civil servants by allowing those who work in the agencies, which will not be privatised but which might be contractorised, to compete on equal terms with private firms which might bid for their jobs?	1995-02-13a.659.8	person/10203	<UNKNOWN>	False	1995-02-13	major	False	False	0	Cabinet Office	Duchy Of Lancaster	Sick Leave	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

The permanent secretary in my Department has written to heads of Departments and agencies, and he will write again to ensure that they look carefully at the guidelines to see whether they can be tightened. In my judgment there is no excuse for the high rate of absenteeism in a few agencies and Departments.	1995-02-13a.660.1	Does my hon Friend agree that, if the average number of sick days taken by Companies House staff is eight times the number taken by staff in the legal secretariat, there is some reason to investigate whether that is due to management, morale or an occupational hazard?	1995-02-13a.660.0	person/10057	<UNKNOWN>	False	1995-02-13	major	False	False	0	Cabinet Office	Duchy Of Lancaster	Sick Leave	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False			
1995-02-13.18.0	Yes, I am happy to reply in the affirmative to my hon Friend. This has been a remarkably successful programme and it has produced cost savings of more than £400 million a year, which is an average of 20 per cent. That is excellent news for the taxpayer.	1995-02-13a.660.6	Can my right hon Friend confirm that, whereas some Opposition Members seem to have grasped the political advantage of moving away from state monopolies for the provision of public services while others still seem possessed of a union-inspired fear of competition, no such confusion exists among Conservative Members?

1995-02-13.18.1	In the overall scheme of things, what matters is quality and value for money for the taxpayer. Generally, that can involve improvement in the quality of service. It is important to recognise that many of the savings were achieved as a result of tremendous effort by all the staff involved. That applies particularly where there was an in-house bid. We are in the current year now examining a further £860 million-worth of public services and a programme for another £250 million-with non-departmental public bodies. Value for money and an improvement in quality will result.	1995-02-13a.660.8	In terms of the provision of services and the bringing down of costs through competition, did the Secretary of State's Department advise the Home Office about the contract for Group 4 to run Wolds prison, because Group 4 did not submit the lowest tender?	1995-02-13a.660.7	person/10508	person/21733	False	1995-02-13	major	False	False	0	Cabinet Office	Duchy Of Lancaster	Competition	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

Gift aid receipts were £385 million in 1996-97 and were £830 million in the latest year for which figures are available. The transitional relief that we have been able to provide has been widely welcomed by the charitable sector. My hon Friend is right that there is still a lot of unclaimed money in gift aid, and both the Government and the charitable sector must work to ensure that it is taken up.	2008-05-07b.685.7	Gift aid has been such a successful scheme that there was real concern about detrimental effects when announcements were made about changes to the tax regime. Will my right hon Friend ensure that there is close contact with the charitable sector, including the many small organisations, to ensure that it fully understands the changes so that the scheme can be as effective as it has been in the past?	2008-05-07b.685.6	person/11057	person/11545	True	2008-05-07	brown	False	False	0	Cabinet Office	Duchy Of Lancaster	Gift Aid	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

I shall make representations to my right hon Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer.	2008-05-07b.686.3	Will my right hon Friend look sympathetically at the representations that have been made to extend gift aid to subscriptions to junior sports clubs?

To be candid, the costs would be significant, running to hundreds of millions of pounds. EU legislation also poses barriers, although I will look into the point that she makes. My feeling, from talking to people in the charitable sector, is that the argument has moved on. People welcome the gift aid reliefs, and they want to build on the system that we improved and have protected through the transitional relief that I have mentioned.	2008-05-07b.686.5	As the Secretary of State will be aware, many charities will have a hole in their budget when the transitional period is over.

We should be honest about the fact that we can do much more to promote payroll giving. Outside work is being done on how payroll giving can be reformed to make it more attractive for people to take up, because there is nothing like having people committed to giving to a charity through their payroll. It means that the charity has some certainty about the income that it will receive. I would welcome any suggestions that my hon Friend or others have about how to improve the system of payroll giving and increase take-up.	2008-05-07b.686.7	It is good news that charities now have three years to prepare for what will be a hit when the gift aid rates come into line with income tax rates.

I shall write to her.	2008-05-07b.687.1	Relate is a fantastic charity that offers a valuable service in many of our constituencies. I met Sue Andrew, the Hertfordshire director of Relate, who said that the charity had previously been entitled to gift aid but was not now. Relate stresses that it suggests a voluntary donation of approximately £40 in Hertfordshire, but it does not withdraw services if a donation is not forthcoming. Indeed, some families give more. Will the Minister investigate why gift aid has not been available for Relate?	2008-05-07b.687.0	person/11798	person/11545	False	2008-05-07	brown	False	False	0	Cabinet Office	Duchy Of Lancaster	Gift Aid	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2008-05-07.0.6	I pay tribute to the right hon Gentleman's ingenuity in bringing that point into a question about gift aid. I think that it is good that we are cutting the basic rate of tax to 20p. As we can see, that has an effect on the charitable sector, and it is right that we should try to help the charitable sector out. As I said earlier, I think that the transitional relief has been widely welcomed.	2008-05-07b.687.3	"We miss the Secretary, Cabinet Office, the hon Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Watson) from his usual place, but he has courteously explained why he is away. I am sure that the whole House will want to send him and his wife all its good wishes for the forthcoming event.
We welcome the transitional relief to which the Secretary of State refers, which has been given to compensate charities for the shortfall in gift aid income as a result of the Prime Minister's income tax changes, after my hon Friend the Member for Tunbridge Wells (Greg Clark) raised the issue in the Budget debate last year.

Charities should not feel constrained from biting the hand that feeds them. Whether they are funded by an organisation, a local authority or a national Government, they should feel absolutely free to campaign against the policies of that authority or Government. I want the Commissioner for the Compact, Sir Bert Massie, to consider how we can do more locally to ensure that local organisations can campaign with freedom on local issues.	2008-05-07b.688.5	Does the Minister have an estimate of the degree to which local authorities punish charities that campaign for change within their area and on behalf of residents?

As I have said in answer to some other questions today, we will endeavour to look at the issue that the hon Gentleman raises.	2008-05-07b.688.7	In the area that I represent, public transport is inadequate for many people who do not have cars. Voluntary community transport schemes provide people with the opportunity to be taken to hospital, yet the amount of money that the schemes can pay volunteers who provide their own vehicle has been pegged. The schemes are not allowed to pay any more without tax being deducted. As there has been an increase in the price of petrol and in other costs, will the Minister consider that and decide whether the amount paid can now be increased?	2008-05-07b.688.6	person/11324	person/11545	False	2008-05-07	brown	False	False	0	Cabinet Office	Duchy Of Lancaster	Social Change	0	liberal-democrat	False	False	labour	True	False

However, I can tell my hon Friend that I know that others in Government are looking at this matter, and I hope that they are doing so sympathetically."	2008-05-07b.689.1	One social change that I have been working with the third sector to try to achieve is a shift towards healthier lifestyles and diets. Will the Minister join me in congratulating organisations such as the Child Poverty Action Group and Unison? They have joined me in campaigning for free, universal and locally sourced school lunches to ensure that every child in every school has a hot, healthy meal.	2008-05-07b.689.0	person/11592	person/11545	False	2008-05-07	brown	False	False	0	Cabinet Office	Duchy Of Lancaster	Social Change	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

2008-05-07.2.0	My hon Friend is absolutely right, and I certainly want to congratulate him on his work as a champion of young people and young volunteering in his constituency. The Ingol and Tanterton Action Group does terrific work, and I want to emphasise that its intergenerational nature fosters better relationships between younger and older people in the community. That can do a great deal to break down barriers, dispel myths and build community cohesion between people of different ages.	2008-05-07b.690.1	I thank my hon Friend for that reply. Will he join me in congratulating the Ingol and Tanterton Action Group, and in commending it for its work? The group is made up of many young people from Preston who are working in the community to develop many fantastic activities such as summer festivals, internet cafés, coaching in sports activities and DJ workshops. They are also working with older people to generate the intergenerational capacity that we need so much in our communities.	2008-05-07b.690.0	person/10682	person/10287	True	2008-05-07	brown	False	False	0	Cabinet Office	Duchy Of Lancaster	National Youth Volunteering Programme	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

Some £75 million of the £117 million that v will be delivering has come via the v involved programme. The match-funding target is some £45 million. To date, v has secured more than £32 million in pledges for youth volunteering from the private sector—well on course!	2008-05-07b.690.3	When the charity v was launched by the Prime Minister two years ago, it was set a target of raising £50 million from the private sector.

I think that there is particular value in the one-to-one relationship that that can provide for young people, either when they are in custody or when they leave custody and go back into the community and need support. May I remind everybody that the first week of June is national volunteers week? I hope that every Member of the House will take the opportunity to go to their volunteer centre—my hon Friend mentioned the one in Mansfield—and offer their services for a couple of hours during volunteers week.	2008-05-07b.690.5	Is the Minister aware that we have a very active volunteer centre in Mansfield?

The changes that we announced in the Budget—not just the transitional relief for gift aid but changes to rules on auditing and record-keeping—are specifically designed to help small charities, which often get small donations and find that there is a lot of complication and bureaucracy involved in claiming gift aid. I hope that she will find that the changes will help her local charity.	2008-05-07b.691.5	The Mary Stevens hospice in Stourbridge is much loved by all my constituents—so much so that it derives 82 per cent. of its income from legacies and donations.

It is important that the Government do not try to do the task themselves, because independent organisations are doing a very good job.	2008-05-07b.691.7	Websites such as justgiving.com make it easy for people who want to donate to charities to access gift aid.

He is absolutely right about the need to increase the amount of social housing that is built; that is what we are doing, through local authorities, housing associations and other means, but no doubt his campaign will continue.	2008-05-07b.692.2	I am surprised that the Minister has not received representations from the many thousands of people who are unfortunately trapped on council house waiting lists, and who are therefore excluded from decent housing. In fact, the Labour Government's achievement in developing council housing post-1945 was perhaps our greatest contribution to public health. The House will welcome the millions and billions that are to be spent on housing, but a great proportion of that money should go directly to local authorities, where it will be well spent helping to reduce the historic waiting lists.	2008-05-07b.692.1	person/10492	person/11545	True	2008-05-07	brown	False	False	0	Cabinet Office	Duchy Of Lancaster	Social Exclusion	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

He makes an important point, and we will look at it as part of that work.	2008-05-07b.692.4	Will the Minister ensure that social exclusion policy includes prisoners with literacy problems and those who suffer from dyslexia so that more can be done while they are in prison to help to raise their literacy skills so that they have a better opportunity when they return to society and do not reoffend?	2008-05-07b.692.3	person/10079	person/11545	False	2008-05-07	brown	False	False	0	Cabinet Office	Duchy Of Lancaster	Social Exclusion	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False

I look forward to Rhyl and many other seaside towns continuing to regenerate in the years ahead.	2008-05-07b.692.6	What recent representations has my right hon Friend received on social exclusion in seaside towns?	2008-05-07b.692.5	person/10518	person/11545	False	2008-05-07	brown	False	False	0	Cabinet Office	Duchy Of Lancaster	Social Exclusion	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

We take responsibility for the fact that we have taken 600,000 children out of poverty since 1997; we take responsibility for the fact that we have 3 million more jobs in this country; and we take responsibility for the fact that we will continue to show that we are the best party on poverty.	2008-05-07b.693.0	Will the right hon Gentleman, who has ministerial responsibility for social exclusion, take his share of responsibility for the abolition of the 10p rate, given that it has plunged 300,000 more people into poverty and hits those on the poverty line hardest? The Prime Minister has promised to listen, but many Members on both sides of the House think that the trouble is that he has listened too much to the right hon Gentleman and his gang.	2008-05-07b.692.7	person/11884	person/11545	False	2008-05-07	brown	False	False	0	Cabinet Office	Duchy Of Lancaster	Social Exclusion	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2008-05-07.5.0	I am unused to such a tribute from the Opposition when I rise to speak. My hon Friend is absolutely right. Baroness Neuberger, who was appointed volunteering champion by my right hon Friend the Prime Minister, identified the issue of bureaucracy and unnecessary checks on volunteers. There is anecdotal evidence of some confusion, which means that potential volunteers and, indeed, young volunteers are being checked unnecessarily, and that acts as a barrier to participation. I am therefore pleased to be able to tell the House that we will produce clearer guidance to voluntary organisations about volunteering, about when, and when not, to recheck individuals and about alternatives to checking such as seeking references, which, I hope, will reduce the barriers that my hon Friend described.	2008-05-07b.693.6	Does my hon Friend accept that too much paperwork and red tape deters young people from volunteering, so what can he do to avoid unnecessary time-consuming checks, especially in cases where those volunteers are not involved with children and vulnerable adults?	2008-05-07b.693.4	person/10141	person/10287	True	2008-05-07	brown	False	False	0	Cabinet Office	Duchy Of Lancaster	Volunteering	1	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2008-05-07.5.1	My hon Friend makes a good point—it is one that he has made to me in the past—about being able to accredit and recognise, through qualifications, the contributions made by young people when they engage in volunteering. He will be glad to know that v is developing a system to bring on board the best experiences from the Duke of Edinburgh award and other schemes that give out certificates that recognise the contribution made by young people, either in their initial attempt to volunteer or if they volunteer for, say, 40 or 50 hours. We wish to find a way of building in the ability to accredit young people's contribution to the community and recognise that through volunteering and the certificate employers and universities can see the contribution that they have made to the community in which they live.	2008-05-07b.693.8	May I commend to my hon Friend the work of TimeBank—the largest volunteer organisation in the UK, of which I am a patron?

2008-05-07.7.6	"That is what the debate at the moment is about. I have appealed to Members of this House to look at the matter so that we can find a consensus. I have said that using the Civil Contingencies Act 2004, which some people wish to use for this purpose, would mean going beyond 28 days, but we would have to declare a state of emergency to do so. Many people in this House would be prepared to have a period lasting longer than 28 days, but to do so we would have to declare a state of emergency.
I and the Government are proposing that we give a power to the House. The Home Secretary, with the Director of Public Prosecutions and the head of the Metropolitan police, would have to come to this House with an order and the House would have to vote a second time on whether it approved the action to allow someone to be detained for more than 28 days before they were charged. I believe that the safeguards that we have put in place protect the citizen against arbitrary treatment. They include a judge reviewing the detention every seven days, a report by an independent reviewer, the Home Secretary being required to come to the House and a final report on how the procedure had been adopted. Those are the protections for civil liberties that people have asked for. But I have to take the advice of other people who tell me that it is important for us to have a precautionary power in place so that, if there were a multiple incident, we could go beyond 28 days with the approval of the House.
I have looked at terrorist incidents over the past few years, and I have looked at the sophistication of terrorists who are using multiple passports, multiple telephone numbers and multiple e-mailing facilities. If there was a plot involving a number of people, we would need more than 28 days to review all the evidence. I believe that most sensible people in this House, as well as most members of the general public, support that position, and I hope that the House votes for it."	2008-05-07b.699.4	Does the Prime Minister recall agreeing with me when I suggested to him a month or two ago that the House was going to need a much better and fuller explanation of why an increase in time is being sought by the Government for holding people in detention without charge?

In the next few weeks, we will look at what more we can do to help the housing market and the construction industry as a result, and we will look at what we can do to help first-time buyers, who are in a difficult position because of the rise in mortgage rates being charged by building societies. We will look at how we help those people who are subject to high utility bills. On employment, we will work with small and medium-sized businesses to ensure that they have the funds to invest for the future. In every area, we will look at what we can do to help Britain to withstand a problem that is hitting America and the rest of Europe, and I believe that the strength of the British economy will withstand the problems that we face.	2008-05-07b.700.1	"In my constituency of Bury, North today—[Hon Members: ""Hear, hear!""] In Bury, we now have the only Tory leader in the country who has been subject to a police investigation into fiddling pensioners' postal votes.

2008-05-07.8.3	I have given support to those South African workers who stopped an arms shipment coming from China that would have gone to Zimbabwe. At the same time, we have been calling at the United Nations for an arms embargo, to prevent other arms and armaments from getting into Zimbabwe at this time. This is a critical time for Zimbabwe. It is important that we recognise that the African Union, the Southern African Development Community and all those who have an interest in the future of Zimbabwe should apply pressure, so that any elections that take place in Zimbabwe are free and fair, monitored by the whole international community to be seen as free and fair, so that justice is done in securing for the Zimbabwean people their democratic rights.	2008-05-07b.702.1	May I tell the Prime Minister that last week the Wolverhampton trades council organised a May day celebration that attracted more than 1,000 trade unionists, who paid tribute to their fellow workers—dock workers—in South Africa who, in a very principled stand, refused to handle arms to Zimbabwe? May I ask the Prime Minister to give support to that action and to recognise that where trade unionists act to intervene on international business for humanitarian aims, they are to be supported, even though their Governments sometimes look a little tardy?	2008-05-07b.702.0	person/10492	person/10068	False	2008-05-07	brown	True	False	0	Prime Minister	Prime Minister	Sustainable Communities Plan (Kettering)	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

2008-05-07.8.5	The vast majority of British people want more access to their GPs in the evenings and at weekends, and the vast majority of British people welcome the vote by the British Medical Association to give an extra three hours of medical services either on an evening or at the weekend in half the areas of the United Kingdom. I am pleased that that service is now starting. That is why it is surprising that the Conservative health spokesman said in Pulse magazine on 29 April that he wants to restore to GPs the power to make that decision, and presumably also the power to block the extension of primary care to new providers. I do not believe that the Conservative party is acting in the interests of the national health service, and that is the tradition of the Conservative party.	2008-05-07b.702.5	Do people want the right to see their doctors in the evenings and at weekends, or are the Tories right to scrap that right to choose and turn the clock back?	2008-05-07b.702.4	person/11225	person/10068	False	2008-05-07	brown	True	False	0	Prime Minister	Prime Minister	Sustainable Communities Plan (Kettering)	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

Israel's future is as part of a secure middle east, and it must remain optimistic that that can be achieved. We will work with people on both sides to secure a settlement—a two-state solution—with a viable Palestine alongside a secure Israel. I believe that that is the best guarantee of the future of Israel in the next 60 years to come.	2008-05-07b.703.5	Tomorrow, Israel will celebrate the 60th anniversary of its independence.

2008-05-07.8.8	It is right that households are suffering as a result of what has been happening in a world downturn and it is right that fuel prices have gone up—and it is unacceptable that so many people have lost out as a result of that. That is why we have postponed the fuel duty rise, that is why we have increased the winter allowance by £50, and that is why we have negotiated with the utility companies a deal that, next year, £100 million will go to help low-income households in this country. I have to say to the hon Gentleman that none of that happened under a Conservative Government when people were suffering.	2008-05-07b.703.7	A Populus poll of Labour supporters, out today, has said that the Prime Minister should step aside for a younger, fresher and more charismatic leader. I suspect that a few of his colleagues were on the receiving end of those calls. Does he not understand people's anger about his crippling tax increases, which have hit the poorest in this country? He has two proposed tax increases for motorists: a £400 vehicle excise duty for those with family cars and a 2p increase on fuel in the autumn. Will he ditch those proposed tax increases before his colleagues ditch him?	2008-05-07b.703.6	person/10190	person/10068	False	2008-05-07	brown	True	False	0	Prime Minister	Prime Minister	Sustainable Communities Plan (Kettering)	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False

That is because of the fundamental strength of the British economy—something that I believe that all people who look at that will accept. We will continue to create more jobs in this country.	2008-05-07b.704.1	Last week, Nestlé opened a brand new £15 million chocolate factory in my constituency.

Is it not remarkable that not one question coming from the Tory Back Benches is about the substance of policy? They cannot face up to the big policy questions facing this nation.	2008-05-07b.704.3	Does the Prime Minister ever wonder why on earth he took the job?	2008-05-07b.704.2	person/10240	person/10068	False	2008-05-07	brown	True	False	0	Prime Minister	Prime Minister	Sustainable Communities Plan (Kettering)	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2008-05-07.8.11	My hon Friend is absolutely right. We are in discussions with the Council of Mortgage Lenders to enable people to get a better deal when they are faced with difficulties in paying their mortgage bills. At the same time, we have put forward proposals for a shared equity scheme that will allow more people to buy a percentage of their house, if they are not in a position to buy all of it as a result of the changes in the rates that are being charged for mortgages. We will do everything that we can to help young homebuyers to get on to the first rung of the housing ladder.	2008-05-07b.704.5	The Prime Minister referred earlier in his answers to colleagues to affordable housing. Can he tell us more about what he is doing to ensure that those who are struggling to pay their mortgages have the leeway to manage their budgets?	2008-05-07b.704.4	person/10229	person/10068	False	2008-05-07	brown	True	False	0	Prime Minister	Prime Minister	Sustainable Communities Plan (Kettering)	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2010-04-07.0.0	"The right hon Gentleman is wrong to say that the Inland Revenue has not been helpful to Scottish businesses given that its own business payment support service has helped more than 18,000 firms in Scotland, with deferred payments of tax totalling more than £300 million. That, I think, is one of the ""real help"" ways in which we have assisted small businesses. The package announced in this year's Budget will give £2.5 billion to small businesses and includes a doubling of their investment allowances. We have a good track record in helping businesses and especially in helping growth in new jobs from which the highlands and islands, in particular, will benefit."	2010-04-07b.951.12	Would the Minister agree that it is highly ironic that at a time when the Government-with everyone's support-are seeking through their commitment to offshore wind development, for example, to encourage major inward investment in manufacturing in the highland economy from firms such as KBR at Nigg, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs' approach to small and medium-sized businesses is driving the likes of Highland Airways, Gaeltec on Skye and others to the wall with the result that the savings accruing to the public purse are more than wiped out by the additional costs of unemployment and all the other benefits that will have to be paid?	2010-04-07b.951.11	person/10334	person/11076	True	2010-04-07	brown	False	False	0	Scotland	Scotland	Highlands And Islands Economy	0	liberal-democrat	False	False	labour	True	False
2010-04-07.0.1	Yet again, my right hon Friend gets to the heart of the matter. Tartan week should be a showcase for increasing our exports to the USA and increasing tourism. Instead, the SNP has characterised it by its own obsession with independence and its gripes, rather than promoting Scotland.	2010-04-07b.952.1	When I was a Northern Ireland Minister, I organised an 11-city tour of the United States to try to bring jobs and inward investment to Northern Ireland. Nationalists were involved in those visits, but they did not try to sell the message of trying to take Northern Ireland out of the United Kingdom. Might I suggest to my hon Friend that she should draw that to the attention of those separatist Scottish National party Ministers from the Scottish Parliament, who are peddling separatism in the United States rather than trying to bring jobs to Scotland?	2010-04-07b.952.0	person/10306	person/11076	False	2010-04-07	brown	False	False	0	Scotland	Scotland	Highlands And Islands Economy	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2010-04-07.0.2	The hon Gentleman should look at the facts of the case. Sadly, Highland Airways had substantial trading difficulties and many more debts beyond that owing to HMRC. Unfortunately, a takeover was not possible at the last moment and the company went into liquidation, but I understand that the services to the Western Isles are being maintained by Loganair and other services are also being taken account of. We are working hard to help the employees of Highland Airways find new work under the PACE-partnership action for continuing employment-scheme. That is the best and most practical way in which we can help companies and businesses suffering from the recession.	2010-04-07b.952.3	The highlands and islands economy has indeed been damaged by Labour's many fuel tax hikes. The increased tax on cider has been scrapped; can we have the same again for fuel in the Hebrides, please? HMRC's actions have pushed Highland Airways to the wall. As a result, people in Lewis and Harris are now having to wait until late afternoon before they get their newspapers.

2010-04-07.0.3	The hon Gentleman should remember that output in the highlands and islands has risen by 75 per cent. since the Labour Government were elected in 1997, and there are 220,000 more jobs in Scotland since we were elected in 1997. Through our real help to businesses, including the business support scheme, which I again point out has benefited more than 18,000 small businesses in Scotland, we have helped to keep people on the road and to get Scotland into recovery.	2010-04-07b.952.5	The Minister's answer to my right hon Friend the Member for Ross, Skye and Lochaber (Mr. Kennedy) shows just how out of touch she and her ministerial colleagues have become. In the last two years, a quarter of corporate insolvencies in Scotland have been enforced by HMRC. Literally thousands of Scots have lost their jobs because the Chancellor of the Exchequer has been unable to translate his good intentions on managing HMRC into hard, effective action.

2010-04-07.1.0	The hon Lady might be aware that there was recently a case in the Supreme Court regarding the competency of the legislation of the Scottish Parliament. I think that would provide valuable guidance. At the end of the day, when we have difficulties in terms of our relationship with the Scottish Government, we have very detailed procedures with joint ministerial committees in which we can work together to find solutions to problems rather than necessarily considering court action. The fact that the Advocate-General has not needed to take one single case to the Supreme Court since devolution is a symbol of its success.	2010-04-07b.953.6	I am most grateful for that very full reply. How does the hon Lady envisage the situation being resolved if there is a difference in the way in which the Flood and Water Management Bill, for example, once it is adopted, is interpreted in Scotland as opposed to its interpretation in England?	2010-04-07b.953.5	person/10389	person/11076	True	2010-04-07	brown	False	False	0	Scotland	Scotland	Devolution	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False

2010-04-07.1.2	The Calman commission recommended a number of ways in which we could improve intergovernmental relationships, and we are very keen to take them forward. It is regrettable that the Scottish Government have declined to accept those recommendations, which have been supported by the majority in the Scottish Parliament. I note the hon Gentleman's concerns, which I share, regarding the release of Mr. al-Megrahi, but at the end of the day that was a decision solely for the Scottish Government.	2010-04-07b.954.0	One of the Advocate-General's roles is to ensure that the relationship between the Scotland Office and the Scottish Executive works within the devolution settlement. It is clear that when it came to the release of al-Megrahi, the Lockerbie bomber, both the victims and the Scottish Executive were the last to be consulted. What steps has the Minister put in place to ensure that that does not happen again? Will she take this final opportunity to condemn the early release of that bomber, who is alive and well seven months later?	2010-04-07b.953.9	person/11668	person/11076	False	2010-04-07	brown	False	False	0	Scotland	Scotland	Devolution	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2010-04-07.2.0	Scottish National party Members are shouting at my right hon Friend, but over many years he has established an impeccable record among others across the House through his campaigning for families with disabled children. His criticism is therefore all the more valid. It is a matter of cross-party consensus that we should all try and do as much as we can to support families with disabled children. It is pretty shameful that the £34 million that was meant to go towards supporting the NHS in helping disabled children in Scotland went into a big black hole created by the SNP.	2010-04-07b.954.6	Does my right hon Friend recall that one of the most shameful episodes in the history of social services in Scotland was when the Scottish Government accepted £34 million that was allocated for disabled children and their families and used it to give to local councils to keep council tax steady? Will he continue to consult with colleagues so that never again can we have such a distortion of the Barnett formula, and never again can we trust those who claim to speak for Scotland and attack the most vulnerable?	2010-04-07b.954.4	person/10116	person/10453	True	2010-04-07	brown	False	False	0	Scotland	Scotland	Disabled Children (Benefits)	1	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

The Government have announced that people with severe visual impairment will become entitled to the higher-rate mobility component of disability living allowance from April next year. That is after a campaign supported by Members of Parliament of all parties and the Royal National Institute of Blind People. We continue to look for other ways to support families with disabled children.	2010-04-07b.955.0	The Secretary of State will realise that this has been an excessively cold winter in Scotland, and that one of the challenges for people with disabilities is their need for extra heating in their homes.

2010-04-07.3.0	The Scottish Parliament is one of the great democratic innovations and constitutional changes of recent decades, but the Government and the Calman commission believe that there is an in-built weakness in its architecture, in that it is responsible for spending money but not for raising enough of it. The envisaged radical reforms will give it much more power, and in future the ultimate decision about how much money the Scottish Parliament and Government will spend will be for the Scottish Parliament, which will have to make an annual decision on tax rates in Scotland. That is a fair, sustainable and radical approach, and it is an important part of having a stronger Scotland inside a proud United Kingdom.	2010-04-07b.955.5	The Calman commission proposals to make the Scottish Parliament more responsible for its financial decision making offer the possibilities of improving democratic accountability in Scotland and also strengthening the Union.

However, it is part of our future and destiny to ensure that a proud Scotland remains an equal part of the United Kingdom. That is not just my view, but the view of the majority of people all across Scotland.	2010-04-07b.955.7	Although some form of constitutional reform is certainly necessary, does the Secretary of State agree that the best future for all the people of Scotland is to ensure that the country is not an isolated, small entity but part of a strong and prosperous United Kingdom?	2010-04-07b.955.6	person/10348	person/10453	False	2010-04-07	brown	False	False	0	Scotland	Scotland	Calman Commission	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2010-04-07.3.2	The hon Gentleman makes his point with his characteristically good manners and great sense of humour. This is the latest attempt on this matter by a political party, the SNP, that no one in Scotland takes seriously. It is using desperate tactics, but the only thing that Scotland would get by voting SNP in the general election would be a Tory Government. That is because the SNP brought Mrs. Thatcher to power and is desperate to remove this Labour Government as well. The moment that the party decided to prop up a Tory Government was the moment that it surrendered the right to speak for Scotland.	2010-04-07b.956.1	The Secretary of State is absolutely right that there is a commonality of purpose between Labour and Conservatives-they both want to bring cuts to Scotland. We were promised action on the Calman proposals back in the Queen's Speech in November, but since then we have heard nothing, zilch, not a peep. Is it not the case that the Government have no intention of bringing forward his proposals, and that they would prefer to introduce cuts rather than Calman to Scotland?	2010-04-07b.956.0	person/11333	person/10453	False	2010-04-07	brown	False	False	0	Scotland	Scotland	Calman Commission	0	scottish-national-party	False	False	labour	True	False
2010-04-07.4.0	My hon Friend is right. Over recent decades, Aberdeen has been a remarkable European and global centre for the oil and gas industry, but although oil and gas have still some years to run they will not last for ever, so this is an enormous opportunity for Aberdeen, and the north-east of Scotland in particular, to have a permanent centre of European excellence in renewable energy that can bring tens of thousands of jobs to Scotland, especially in my hon Friend's Aberdeen constituency and the north-east of the country.	2010-04-07b.956.6	Does my right hon Friend agree that this investment in jobs and the announcement today that Labour will introduce another 100,000 skilled jobs in Scotland will be the thing that makes a difference to my constituents in Aberdeen?

Of course, that has often not been responded to by the Scottish National party, but in an attempt to be reasonable, and trying to set aside party political divisions on those big issues, the UK Government offered an unparalleled and unprecedented flexibility package to help the Scottish Government build a Forth road bridge. Unfortunately, they rebuffed it; they are stuck in an old ideology, which means that, as we speak, the bridge is no closer.	2010-04-07b.957.2	I thank the Secretary of State for the clarity of his response.

That is why we are helping young people in particular to get back into work. That is why we are growing jobs with our green investment bank. That is why we are helping new industries and renewable industries in the video games industry and in the life sciences.

In the past three months, that figure has risen by 21,000. In the past year, Labour has wiped £4.8 billion off the value of the Scottish economy. Since 1997, Scotland's share of the national debt has more than doubled, and almost 150,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost.

2010-04-07.7.0	My hon Friend is absolutely right. He and others are fantastic champions of shipbuilding in Scotland. He makes a very clear point. The Scottish Conservatives are in favour of industry-destroying cuts, creating elitism and sinking shipyards-we have an unchanged Scottish Conservative party. The last thing that Scotland wants to do is to go back to the old divisions of the 1980s under the Tory party.

Compared with 12 years ago, there are almost 250,000 more people in work in Scotland today, despite the recession. Most people in Scotland are passionate patriots and most Scots are not nationalists. That is why the longer the SNP is in power in Edinburgh, the smaller the support for breaking up Britain becomes.	2010-04-07b.959.4	Speaking in this House as a Conservative and Unionist, may I ask whether the Secretary of State agrees that Scotland's part of the Union has been very beneficial to Scotland, not least in respect of employment?	2010-04-07b.959.3	person/10647	person/10453	False	2010-04-07	brown	False	False	0	Scotland	Scotland	Employment	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False

2010-04-07.10.0	The big issue is whether we can secure and assure the economic recovery. To withdraw £6 billion from the recovery now would put jobs at risk, put businesses at risk and put our growth at risk.

In 2011 we will use the rise in national insurance to guarantee that we fund our policing and our schooling, and to make sure that the health services guarantees of cancer care and of being able to see a GP at weekends and in the evenings are kept. Those guarantees will be kept, because of the decisions that we make.	2010-04-07b.961.1	"May I add my condolences to all those who have lost their lives in the service of their country?

That is the answer to those who say that not enough is being done: more helicopters and more helicopter hours in Afghanistan now.	2010-04-07b.967.1	Will the Prime Minister confirm the whole truth about helicopters, as confirmed by parliamentary answers from the Ministry of Defence?

I believe that the country will make the choice in favour of maintaining and improving our public services, and I think that, once again, the Conservative party is exposed as the party that opposed public service improvements in our country.	2010-04-07b.968.2	"As my right hon Friend the Leader of the Opposition has already said, Paul Walsh, the chief executive of Diageo and a member of the Prime Minister's own management and business advisory committee, has said:

[Interruption.] The Conservatives are not interested in tax credits. Six million families in this country receive tax credits. Twenty million children, mothers and fathers benefit from tax credits. One of the cuts that the Conservatives propose for this year is to cut child tax credits for middle-income families, which would do more to push people into lower-income groups than anything else. They should change their policy and help middle-income families in this country.	2010-04-07b.968.4	Over the years there has been a continual drift away from direct taxes to indirect taxes, which, as the Prime Minister knows, bear most heavily on those who can least afford them. Does he agree that it is becoming time that we went back to the traditional Labour party policy on taxation, which is to redistribute wealth in favour of poorer people? I would like him to say in this general election that he will see direct taxation imposed on the billionaire rich, who should be carrying the real burden of taxation in this country.	2010-04-07b.968.3	person/10623	person/10068	False	2010-04-07	brown	True	False	0	Prime Minister	Prime Minister	Engagements	0	independent	False	False	labour	True	False

It is falling because there are more people here locally getting the jobs that are available. The Conservatives should think twice about their policy on quotas for migration, because the very businesses that they are quoting want to be able to bring people into this country to do the jobs that are necessary. We propose the Australian points system on migration.

That is why the Department of Health has established £100 million of funding to help to back social enterprises such as Local Care Direct, why the Department for Children, Schools and Families is providing £100 million to a youth sector development fund, and why the Department for Work and Pensions is setting aside £100 million for social enterprises that want to create 15,000 jobs during this recession.	2009-05-20b.1485.7	I thank my right hon Friend for that reply.

In February, the Parliamentary Secretary, my hon Friend the Member for Cardiff, West (Kevin Brennan) , announced £42 million of extra help to support charities, voluntary groups and social enterprises that are seeking to do more, and my right hon Friend the Chancellor provided for £20 million on top of that in the Budget. If there is anything more that we can do to help social enterprises in the hon Gentleman's constituency to get their hands on some of that money, I would of course be more than delighted to help.	2009-05-20b.1486.1	In the past year, unemployment has risen by 182 per cent. in my constituency. Biggleswade Baptist church is now operating a debt advice centre, and I suspect that there will be many more of those.

As a Government, we are absolutely clear that we will not repeat the mistakes of the 1980s, when too little help was provided to those losing their work, particularly the young—those under 25. That is why my right hon Friend the Chancellor set aside £1 billion in the Budget to ensure that extra help is available to those under the age of 25 who have been out of work for more than 12 months to ensure that none of them needs to stay out of work, out of training or miss out on a volunteering opportunity. We think that social enterprises have a critical role to play in delivering that programme; that is why the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions announced £100 million of funding for social enterprises to set about the job of giving people new opportunities during this downturn.	2009-05-20b.1486.3	What plans does my right hon Friend have to assist charities and social enterprises in bidding for contracts from the future jobs fund set up by the Department for Work and Pensions—organisations such as the Prince's Trust and the Groundwork trusts, and, at a local level, the British Trust for Conservation Volunteers Cymru, which is based at Forest Farm in my constituency?	2009-05-20b.1486.2	person/10442	person/11360	False	2009-05-20	brown	False	False	0	Cabinet Office	Duchy Of Lancaster	Social Enterprises	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2009-05-20.0.3	I am very happy to give the hon Gentleman that undertaking. If we want to come through this recession as quickly as possible and in a way that best protects families and businesses, we have to ensure that we are not only delivering help to families and businesses but doing everything in our power to ensure that communities are strong, because it is on the foundation of strong communities that we will build a different kind of future for this country. Faith-based organisations have an enormously important role to play, so it is important that they are eligible for the extra assistance that we are providing. I hope that the hon Gentleman will join me in arguing that the funding that we are providing through the Cabinet Office should not be cut back, and never should be in future.	2009-05-20b.1487.0	Would the Minister like to put on record his thanks to the faith-based organisations throughout the country that are doing such a great job? That is further to the comment of my hon Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt) about the Baptist church, but it applies across the denominations, with Catholic and Anglican churches advising on drug rehabilitation and other social programmes, and indeed entrepreneurship programmes. Will he give a commitment to the House that where there is clear evidence of discrimination against churches, his Department will investigate and ensure that it is dealt with, whether that discrimination comes from local authorities or other public sector bodies?	2009-05-20b.1486.4	person/11946	person/11360	False	2009-05-20	brown	False	False	0	Cabinet Office	Duchy Of Lancaster	Social Enterprises	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2009-05-20.0.4	My hon Friend has championed this cause, certainly for the short time that I have been in the House. He is absolutely right that the renewal and regeneration of housing is critical to the future that we want to see in this country. However, there cannot be traditional housing projects as they might have looked 20 or 30 years ago. We know now from pioneering housing associations that there is far more that associations themselves can do not just to build houses and give people homes that are safe and secure but to equip people with skills and connect them with jobs.	2009-05-20b.1487.2	The Minister has referred to the fact that the Chancellor is trying to boost the economy, and therefore demand. He knows, surely, that the voluntary sector prospers best when demand is increasing, and that it plays a significant and progressive part in providing services. However, may I remind him that until we have a serious council house building programme to fire up that part of the economy, it will be very difficult for the voluntary sector to make real contributions to the housing market generally?	2009-05-20b.1487.1	person/10492	person/11360	False	2009-05-20	brown	False	False	0	Cabinet Office	Duchy Of Lancaster	Social Enterprises	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

Because the Financial Services Authority will regulate the fund, it is of course vital that it oversees how the regulations are drawn up.	2009-05-20b.1487.4	"Is not the biggest barrier to the expansion of the role of social enterprises in providing public services the lack of appropriate finance for expansion? Would not the quickest way to fill that gap be the rapid establishment of the social investment bank? Does the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster agree with the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government? She said yesterday at an all-party group:
""I'd like to say we have a plan for a social investment bank but we don't."""	2009-05-20b.1487.3	person/10423	person/11360	False	2009-05-20	brown	False	False	2	Cabinet Office	Duchy Of Lancaster	Social Enterprises	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2009-05-20.1.0	The social enterprise that my hon Friend highlights has been an inspiration to many in the social enterprise sector and beyond, and we have been very keen to learn some lessons from its experience. It is part of a growing pattern of success, and indeed the sector as a whole grew its work force by some 20,000 in the last year for which figures are available. We are determined to help the sector do more, which is why my right hon Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions set out £100 million of support to help the social enterprise sector, including enterprises such as she highlights, create 15,000 jobs in the year or two to come.	2009-05-20b.1488.5	The west Lancashire furniture recycling organisation helps people in my constituency by offering recycled goods and also provides employment and volunteering opportunities to those who face barriers to employment. In the past 18 months it has recruited 11 employees, five of whom were long-term unemployed or on incapacity benefit. Does my right hon Friend agree that such social enterprises are integral to the social and economic strength of our local communities?	2009-05-20b.1488.4	person/11667	person/11360	True	2009-05-20	brown	False	False	0	Cabinet Office	Duchy Of Lancaster	Social Enterprises	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2009-05-20.1.1	My view is that social enterprises can reach much further than many public services; they can reach communities to which public services have traditionally found it hard to connect. They can also often innovate in finding new ways of bringing public services together. That is one of the most important prizes that the groups to which the hon Gentleman referred bring to the table. That is why cutting back the Cabinet Office budget by £100 million, as is proposed in some quarters, would be a grave error. It would diminish our impact on getting on with that sort of job.	2009-05-20b.1489.0	Does the Minister agree that, although many charities, citizens advice bureaux and faith-based organisations do excellent work in trying to get information to tens of thousands of people in Northern Ireland and throughout the UK about the benefits to which they are entitled, there is still a hard core of people whom the information appears not to reach? Does he also agree that we need to be much more innovative and dynamic in trying to reach those communities to ensure that they get what they are entitled to?	2009-05-20b.1488.6	person/10780	person/11360	False	2009-05-20	brown	False	False	0	Cabinet Office	Duchy Of Lancaster	Social Enterprises	0	dup	False	False	labour	True	False
2009-05-20.1.2	That is precisely the sort of thing that the Government would like to flourish. For that reason, the Department of Health has set aside £100 million to invest in social enterprises. It sounds as though the organisation that the hon Gentleman highlights is exactly the sort of enterprise about which the Department of Health would like to hear more. The fund is administered by Futurebuilders, and that would, therefore, be the first port of call for the hon Gentleman.	2009-05-20b.1489.2	I am encouraged by the Minister's comments. Crazy Hats, a charity in my constituency, which deals with breast cancer and helps those who are recovering from it, wants to create a drop-in centre in my constituency for the whole of north Northamptonshire. Is that the sort of thing that the Minister would encourage? Could he point us in the direction of any funding?	2009-05-20b.1489.1	person/11915	person/11360	False	2009-05-20	brown	False	False	0	Cabinet Office	Duchy Of Lancaster	Social Enterprises	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2009-05-20.1.3	The Parliamentary Secretary, my hon Friend the Member for Cardiff, West (Kevin Brennan) , is having such conversations. Pioneering examples of what social enterprises can do differently are to be found in every part of the country, and it is vital that we ruthlessly exploit good ideas rather than constantly try to reinvent them.	2009-05-20b.1489.4	Would my right hon Friend consider having a discussion with the devolved Parliaments? We should consider best practice, and not reinvent the wheel throughout the UK. Will he consider holding a meeting with the Secretaries of State for Scotland, for Wales and for Northern Ireland so that we can talk about how best to take social enterprise forward?	2009-05-20b.1489.3	person/10934	person/11360	False	2009-05-20	brown	False	False	0	Cabinet Office	Duchy Of Lancaster	Social Enterprises	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2009-05-20.1.4	When those funds are announced, it is important to appreciate that not only Ministers like me are in charge of writing the cheques. It is important to give an arm's length organisation the task of running the fund and understanding how the money is best deployed. Sometimes going through the process of contracting for that delivery partner can take time. We make no excuses for getting the right partner in place to get the money flowing, but we will not subscribe to the hon Gentleman's view that we should somehow wean social enterprises, charities or voluntary groups off public funding, because we know that it is vital to their success.	2009-05-20b.1490.0	The Minister's predecessor launched the £70 million community builders fund in July 2008 with great fanfare. It is there to help our social entrepreneurs and people who want to show leadership in keeping our communities strong. They need support at this time more than ever. Will the Minister confirm that, almost a year later, not one penny has been invested from the fund? Will he explain why not and tell us when the fund will deliver something more than a press release?	2009-05-20b.1489.5	person/11792	person/11360	False	2009-05-20	brown	False	False	0	Cabinet Office	Duchy Of Lancaster	Social Enterprises	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2009-05-20.2.0	I understand the hon Gentleman's arguments. Indeed, I read the transcript of his Westminster Hall debate last year, and I know that he proposes some positive ideas, which the Government should take up. The Government are taking up open source solutions—50 per cent. of Government websites use open source software and we are about to deploy Linux-based platforms, which will go to 300,000 NHS workers. In the spirit of open source, I ask the hon Gentleman, who is a renowned expert in the field, to come and meet our officials, share some of his ideas with us and help us improve what we do.	2009-05-20b.1490.5	The Government have talked a good game for some time about open source software, but have done very little. What more can the Parliamentary Secretary do to encourage Departments to implement real change and reduce the horrific cost and genuine inconvenience of software licensing?	2009-05-20b.1490.4	person/11174	person/11309	True	2009-05-20	brown	False	False	0	Cabinet Office	Duchy Of Lancaster	Open Source Software	0	liberal-democrat	False	False	labour	True	False
2009-05-20.2.1	They are a very important part of the debate. There is no doubt that open standards and interoperability are the means by which we will improve our IT sourcing. When we talk about open source, we should remember that it is only free to acquire and that we also must invest to maintain and sustain our systems.	2009-05-20b.1490.7	Would my hon Friend put this debate into perspective? Does he agree that most of the chief information officers would agree that open source has its place, but that open standards are a much more important part of the debate?	2009-05-20b.1490.6	person/10435	person/11309	False	2009-05-20	brown	False	False	0	Cabinet Office	Duchy Of Lancaster	Open Source Software	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

In fact, why don't I talk to the chief executive of direct.gov and put that question to her?	2009-05-20b.1491.0	Open source and open standards are important, but I have noticed that BT offers a free laptop, a free website and free help to all our charities. The open source and all the things for charities are available for free, so is there a way that we can round it all up in one place, on the direct.gov site?	2009-05-20b.1490.8	person/10657	person/11309	False	2009-05-20	brown	False	False	0	Cabinet Office	Duchy Of Lancaster	Open Source Software	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2009-05-20.3.0	The social enterprise that my hon Friend highlights is part of a sector of some 55,000 social enterprises that creates a turnover of around £27 billion. That enterprise, flair and innovation will be especially valuable in helping to get Britain through this downturn faster and in a way that protects families and businesses. That is why the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions has set aside £100 million to help social enterprises get people back to work. It is also why the Cabinet Office is managing a clear set of ambitions to help ensure that those with learning disabilities or mental health issues are part of social enterprises' work, because we know that those people, too, have a right to help and a contribution to make, and we are determined to unlock it.	2009-05-20b.1491.5	That is good news. Phoenix is a social enterprise in Swindon that works with people recovering from mental health problems by offering them work in a mailing and assembly service. I should declare an interest, because I have used the service, paying for it through my office costs allowance, and excellent value for money it was. What can my right hon Friend do in a recession to help secure longer-term funding for social enterprises, so that they can help more people?	2009-05-20b.1491.4	person/11866	person/11360	True	2009-05-20	brown	False	False	0	Cabinet Office	Duchy Of Lancaster	Social Enterprises	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2009-05-20.3.1	It is important that we do a couple of things. It is important that we continue to invest in training those in charge of procurement and commissioning in local authorities. The hon Gentleman will forgive me for saying that the budget for that would, I am afraid, be cut if we sliced £100 million off the Cabinet Office budget. It is also important for us to introduce a bit of transparency, which is why we have asked the social enterprise sector to rate local authorities. We published those statistics earlier this month. I am pleased to say that eight councils in the top 25 were Labour councils. I am afraid that only one was Conservative, but I know that the hon Gentleman will be anxious to turn that situation around.	2009-05-20b.1491.7	Given that much financial support for social enterprises comes from local authorities, as we have heard, and given that most local authorities are tightening their belts in this recession, as they should, what steps will the Minister take to ensure that they do not take the easy option and slash their budgets for social enterprises, thus leaving a lot of disadvantaged and vulnerable people in this country without proper assistance?	2009-05-20b.1491.6	person/10575	person/11360	False	2009-05-20	brown	False	False	0	Cabinet Office	Duchy Of Lancaster	Social Enterprises	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2009-05-20.3.2	First, may I praise my hon Friend for the charitable work that he does? Organisations such as The Hinge will have an enormous contribution to make over the coming months, and the strength that they could acquire in that time could serve them well in regard to their long-term contribution to the sector and to the communities that they work in. That is exactly why different Departments right across Government are putting in place significant amounts of funding to help the sector over the next two or three years. That funding would be cut if we took the advice of some in the House. Once the money is in place, it is vital that we get rid of any impediments to getting deals done, which is why I am bringing Ministers together to clear those road blocks out of the way much faster.	2009-05-20b.1492.1	My right hon Friend will be aware of the fine work that social enterprises and charities do across all our constituencies, such as The Hinge, in Goole, which works with young, vulnerable and homeless people. That is a client group that, sadly, is likely to grow through this recession. Will my right hon Friend reassure me that there will be fast-track funding to help social enterprises deal with that difficult and growing client group?	2009-05-20b.1492.0	person/10097	person/11360	False	2009-05-20	brown	False	False	0	Cabinet Office	Duchy Of Lancaster	Social Enterprises	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2009-05-20.3.3	I am very grateful for that example, because I was not aware of the contribution that the livery companies were making to this agenda. The hon Gentleman underlines my point that we will get through this recession faster, and in a way that protects families and businesses better, if we build our work on strong communities. It is the faith-based organisations, charities, voluntary groups and, I now know, livery companies that are knitting those communities together.	2009-05-20b.1492.3	Would the Minister accept that the country and the Government cannot do without charities, churches and volunteers? We have a deprived estate in Macclesfield, the Moss estate. The local churches—with the support of my own livery company, the Worshipful Company of Weavers, which has invested a great deal in the project—are putting a great many volunteers and community workers into that estate to help to reduce the deprivation and exclusion and the other problems that often go with exclusion.	2009-05-20b.1492.2	person/10647	person/11360	False	2009-05-20	brown	False	False	0	Cabinet Office	Duchy Of Lancaster	Social Enterprises	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2009-05-20.4.0	Yes. Of the £15.5 million targeted support fund, which opened to applications on 29 April , Bradford will get £410,892, which will be delivered by the Bradford and district community empowerment network. If my hon Friend has any organisations that he wants to steer in the network's direction, I recommend that he do so.	2009-05-20b.1493.3	I thank the Minister for that reply. I understand that Bradford's allocation is about £411,000.

In addition, the Office of the Third Sector has already held nine regional roadshows, which have been fully subscribed. Business Link is a free business advice and support service, and it is also available to the third sector. In Scotland, Business Gateway Scotland provides a similar service, giving advice on what help is available to businesses and the third sector.	2009-05-20b.1493.5	The Real Help website and documentation should be—and, indeed, are—really helpful, but I cannot help but think that MPs and the Government have perhaps not done enough to promote awareness of these services to the sectors that could really benefit from them.

Sometimes, I have to say that it seems that we have been discussing the ombudsman for that long as well. We know that 134 MPs said that they wanted to remove the MP filter, but I cannot honestly say to my hon Friend that that is the settled will of the House. To be honest with him, I would also have to say that there is no settled view in Government either, but I undertake to take soundings from Members again to ensure that their views are properly reflected when we come to make our decision.	2009-05-20b.1494.0	One of the great achievements of a previous Labour Government was to introduce the parliamentary ombudsman system, against the resistance of elements of the Conservative party.

Many of them have served our country and our Army with huge distinction over the years. We were the first Government to say that those after 1997 should be able to have residence and settlement in this country, and 6,000 have done so. We have also equalised pay and pensions, while at the same time raising the Gurkhas' pensions back in their own country. We said that we would listen to the voice of the House after the debate held a few weeks ago, and we are also listening to the views of the Home Affairs Committee, which has had hearings. The Home Secretary will make a statement tomorrow. I believe it is possible for us to honour our commitments to the Gurkhas, and to do so in a way that protects the public finances. That will be part of the announcement to be made tomorrow.	2009-05-20b.1495.3	May I associate myself with my right hon Friend's remarks about those brave servicemen and women who have died in the cause of Afghanistan?

That means that £70 billion of additional lending will go into the economy this year—£25 billion from the Royal Bank of Scotland, £14 billion from Lloyds bank, and money voluntary promoted by HSBC. There will be £70 billion of total additional lending. We are the only country in the world that has such a programme, where the banks have signed up legally to supporting additional lending.

2009-05-20.6.6	The future of this country will be built on modern manufacturing strength. In advanced manufacturing we are one of the great leaders of the world; we have some of the greatest companies in the world—they operate from Britain but are global players with huge strengths in new technology and in innovation. Our manufacturing strategy is to support our large companies and to encourage innovation so that we have small and medium-sized companies coming forward. We gave additional investment allowances for manufacturing in the Budget, our corporation tax is the lowest that it has been for many, many years, and we continue to support small businesses with enterprise grants; 128,000 businesses have now received some help from the Government during this downturn to get through these difficult times. As 50 per cent. of our manufacturing is exported, it is so important that the European economy moves forward as well; it is very important to us that we work with Europe so that we achieve growth and jobs for the future.	2009-05-20b.1499.4	As a member of your panel of Chairmen, Mr. Speaker, may I say that you have been a kind and caring Speaker, and that that will never be forgotten? Does the Prime Minister accept that manufacturing industry is one of the only sources of sustainable non-inflationary economic growth? Sadly, the number employed in manufacturing has dropped from 4.5 million in 1997 to 2.73 million today. Will he and his Government ensure that they do not place any additional burdens, such as the increase in national insurance, fuel tax and regulation, on manufacturing industry? We want to be competitive. Please will he encourage, and not de-incentivise, industry and manufacturing in this country?	2009-05-20b.1499.3	person/10647	person/10068	False	2009-05-20	brown	True	False	0	Prime Minister	Prime Minister	Engagements	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False

2009-05-20.6.9	To look at a proposal that, at this time in our history, would give just 3,000 millionaires £200,000 each would be completely scandalous—and to do that for 3,000 of the top estates in this country, whether they have a moat or not, is something that the public would be unable to accept.	2009-05-20b.1500.5	Can my right hon Friend tell me which is the best way to help people through these difficult economic times? Is it to cut tax for 22 million basic rate taxpayers, increase child benefit and provide extra help for 12 million pensioners, or is it to give tax cuts of £200,000 each to 3,000 millionaires, of which there are 19 in the shadow Cabinet?	2009-05-20b.1500.4	person/13933	person/10068	False	2009-05-20	brown	True	False	0	Prime Minister	Prime Minister	Engagements	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

To avoid the misery of a forced eviction, the Travellers must now move on peacefully, but the situation could be greatly helped if the Government helped to identify transit sites outside the district—particularly as the Government have some responsibility for this issue because they stopped the council dealing with it in 2003.

2009-05-20.6.11	Proper nutrition for young children is absolutely crucial, and that is why the pilot project to give primary school children free school meals—something that worked when it was tried by individual councils throughout the country—is being supported by the Government. Newham, Durham and Wolverhampton will be the pilots, and they will test whether free healthy school meals improve children's health and well-being. Some £20 million in funding will come from the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, and that money is being matched by the local authorities. We believe that it will show that good nutrition at an early age makes a difference not only to health but to educational performance.	2009-05-20b.1501.2	Will my right hon Friend join me in congratulating Durham county council on its excellent and successful bid to be one of only two authorities to host the universal free school meals pilot for primary school children?

2009-05-20.6.12	Mr. Speaker, we have work to do. The first work we have to do is to clean up the system in the House of Commons. It is for this Parliament to face up to its responsibilities, to change and to clean up the system. I believe that we have made progress, and the way to clean up the system is to take the action to do so. Secondly, we have a recession that we are trying to manage and come through. It is in the interests of the people of this country that we help people who are unemployed, help mortgage holders and help people with small businesses. I have not heard policies from people on the other side of the House that would actually do that.	2009-05-20b.1501.4	The country has lost touch with the political system and with this Parliament. On the doorstep, it is clear that there is no confidence left in the Prime Minister's Government.

I am very happy to talk to my hon Friend about the project.	2009-05-20b.1502.4	Prime Minister, about five years ago Westfield started to develop a shopping centre in Bradford city centre. It should have been completed next year. The company now says that it does not know when it will be completed, and Bradford is left with a huge hole in the heart of its city centre.

2009-05-20.6.17	I appreciate what the hon Gentleman is saying. There is clearly concern in all sections of the House about how banks can better serve the public during this economic recession to help us through it. I shall look at what he says about the bank if he will give me the names of the companies and the bank. The important thing is that in the past few weeks there has been a change of policy, and I hope that that change of policy will have an impact in every region and every part of this country. The change of policy is that for the first time—because we have given the banks an insurance policy that they pay for—they are now willing to lend extra money and are committed to doing so. The increase of £70 billion for the economy is very substantial indeed, and companies should now be getting the benefit of offers from banks. I urge the hon Gentleman to go back to those banks and remind them of the quantitative targets that have been agreed, and of the other means by which the Government have offered to help small business, including through the Inland Revenue. I shall certainly look at the case that he has raised, but the important thing is that the banks are now under an obligation to lend.	2009-05-20b.1503.1	May I take this opportunity, Mr. Speaker, to pay personal tribute to you for your great kindness, generosity and understanding, which you showed me when I entered this House four years ago?May I ask the Prime Minister what reassurance he might give those of my constituents who are struggling to keep businesses afloat? Is he aware that the banks are ruthlessly pushing many otherwise viable businesses over the edge by refusing reasonable loans to keep liquidity and cash flowing? They are also beginning to charge outrageous interest rates, far above what is reasonable or understandable. Can his Government do anything to pressurise these ruthless banks to free up lending in order to provide better liquidity until the better times come? Otherwise, good businesses are being pushed out of existence.	2009-05-20b.1503.0	person/11402	person/10068	False	2009-05-20	brown	True	False	0	Prime Minister	Prime Minister	Engagements	0	social-democratic-and-labour-party	False	False	labour	True	False

I can reassure him that my Department is first in leading cross-Whitehall work on exports. UK Trade & Investment is one of those entities that connects UK businesses to export opportunities around the world. Indeed, the UK export hub is continuing to travel across the country, meeting first-time exporters face to face. It has already visited Yorkshire, and, indeed, it is in Yorkshire today.	2016-03-15a.773.7	My rural North Yorkshire constituency is home to many businesses with strong local roots but global aspirations.

It is my personal belief that the uncertainty that could be created will be bad for business and bad for jobs and growth. However, there is a lot that the Government have done and will continue to do to support businesses. For example, they have cut the corporation tax rate, which I hope that he welcomes.	2016-03-15a.773.9	How on earth are small and medium-sized businesses going to be competitive if, in 100 days’ time, they find that their access to those level playing field markets will be firmly thrown away and that that door will be shut in their face?

2016-03-15.0.4	My hon Friend is absolutely right. Not enough British businesses export.

2016-03-15.0.5	The hon Lady raises an important issue. We want all people, and that means more and more women, to benefit from our apprenticeship programmes in England, Scotland and elsewhere. In the past few years, we have tripled the number of women in England who take up apprenticeships in engineering, and that is something that Scotland can look at as well to see how we achieved that. I also think that trying to get more women to think about these subjects should start at a much earlier age. We should not point the finger just at colleges and others; we should start at a much earlier age to try to encourage women to look at lots of different careers.	2016-03-15a.774.7	I am sure that the Minister will agree that a big part of helping small and medium-sized businesses become more competitive is ensuring that there is access to a skilled workforce. In National Apprenticeship Week, the Young Women’s Trust has shown that some employment sectors are hardly welcoming any young women. Fewer than 2% of construction apprentices and 4% of engineering apprentices are female. Will the Minister tell me what his Department is doing to encourage more young women into apprenticeships?	2016-03-15a.774.6	person/25409	person/24854	False	2016-03-15	cameron	False	False	2	Business, Energy And Industrial Strategy	Business, Innovation And Skills	Smes: Competitiveness	0	scottish-national-party	False	False	conservative	True	False
2016-03-15.1.0	What I do accept is that more needs to be done to get British businesses exporting. That includes the work of UKTI, but it also means that all Government Departments have a role to play. For example, UKTI works with the Great British Food Unit, an operation started by DEFRA. So I think a lot of Government can get behind exports by working more closely together.	2016-03-15a.775.6	I thank the Secretary of State for that answer, but the reality is that the UK export story is one of declining market share in the global market.

2016-03-15.1.1	In answer to my hon Friend’s first question, of course I can check that tariff and write to him. He raises an important point about trade, and he has clearly raised the issue of tariffs, but he will be aware that there are lots of non-tariff barriers as well, particularly for services. It is important to look at those too.	2016-03-15a.775.8	If the UK left the single market, my understanding is that the highest tariff that could be applied on UK manufactured goods would be the World Trade Organisation’s simple average most-favoured nation applied tariff, which for non-agricultural products is 4.19%. Can my right hon Friend write to me to confirm that is correct, and to provide a factual context for the so-called risks of leaving the European Union? Can he also write to me to confirm that that number is lower than the annual fluctuation in the euro/sterling exchange rate for each of the last three years?	2016-03-15a.775.7	person/24787	person/24854	False	2016-03-15	cameron	False	False	0	Business, Energy And Industrial Strategy	Business, Innovation And Skills	Exports	0	conservative	True	False	conservative	True	False

We are looking very carefully at that proposal and he will hear more shortly.	2016-03-15a.776.1	The Secretary of State’s word will do little for the 40 skilled staff of the Metabrasive steel foundry in Stillington in my constituency, which will close in May.

It would be worth some £400 to each household, and it would certainly help companies like the one in her constituency export more to one of the world’s largest markets.	2016-03-15a.776.3	Spartan Global Services in Cannock exports refurbished computers to businesses across the globe.

Given the Secretary of State’s proximity to the Chancellor, perhaps he does not need a warning. Perhaps he has already given a warning about the Budget, as he probably knows that in the north-west we have seen just half the business investment in SMEs that is being seen in London. Clearly, something has gone wrong with the long-term economic plan if we are not seeing rebalancing, so what conversation have the Secretary of State and his Ministers had with the Treasury about its attack on other financial institutions—for example, building societies?	2016-03-15a.777.9	person/24897	person/24854	True	2016-03-15	cameron	False	False	0	Business, Energy And Industrial Strategy	Business, Innovation And Skills	Small Business: Lending Trends	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False

Ofcom has also recently published its digital communications review, which will impose minimum quality requirements on Openreach that are much tougher than currently exist.	2016-03-15a.778.8	Although I welcome the progress the Government are making on rolling out broadband, it is clear that many businesses are not happy with the service that they are receiving from BT.

2016-03-15.4.1	Failure— [ Interruption. ] As usual, my hon Friends have anticipated my answer: there, on the Labour Benches, is the picture of failure. We have had to write off £50 million from the failed Labour scheme to deliver broadband in South Yorkshire. If a Labour Government had been elected, they would be two years behind us in the roll-out of superfast broadband; they had a target of 2017 to get to 90%—we have already reached it.	2016-03-15a.779.0	The Government claim to champion the critical contribution that small businesses make to our economy, but Ofcom’s latest figures, which the Minister did not mention, show that half of small businesses in business parks cannot get 10 megabits of broadband, a quarter cannot get 5 megabits and one in 10 cannot even get 2 megabits. My local chamber of commerce tells me of businesses where staff have to go home if they want to send an email. Responding to me in a debate last week, the Minister said that the Government’s broadband roll-out had been “an unadulterated success”. If that is success, what would failure look like?	2016-03-15a.778.9	person/24807	person/11905	False	2016-03-15	cameron	False	False	0	Business, Energy And Industrial Strategy	Business, Innovation And Skills	Broadband	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False
2016-03-15.5.0	My hon Friend speaks with experience: he is a distinguished former pension fund manager—a very important service that the UK industry provides. He is right that the EU’s financial services passport means that financial services firms authorised in the UK can provide their services across the EU, without the need for further authorisations. That is, of course, a significant benefit that they receive. Services represent almost 80% of our economy, and access to the world’s largest single market helps them to create thousands of British jobs.	2016-03-15a.779.5	The Secretary of State’s answer highlights the fact that, while exports in goods are vital, especially to manufacturing cities such as Gloucester, our surplus in services might be more vulnerable if we leave Europe. What assessment has he made of sectors such as insurance and investment managers, whose businesses are passported across Europe, and other service sectors, such as advertisers, accountants, animators, designers and film producers?	2016-03-15a.779.4	person/24921	person/24854	True	2016-03-15	cameron	False	False	0	Business, Energy And Industrial Strategy	Business, Innovation And Skills	Balance Of Trade: Services	0	conservative	True	False	conservative	True	False
2016-03-15.5.1	Of course the hon Gentleman is right about the importance of manufacturing in our economy, which is why it has increased in terms of output, employment and value since 2010. The company he mentions, Syngenta, has itself said that there should be no change in its footprint in terms of employment—in fact, we expect that to increase. Also, when it comes to foreign investment in British industry, I see that as a vote of confidence. Since companies such as Jaguar Land Rover have received foreign investment, employment has gone up threefold, and that is great for British manufacturing.	2016-03-15a.779.7	The Secretary of State must know that however good the growth in services exported from this country is—and we all applaud it—it must go hand in hand with an increase in manufacturing. Is he not worried that Syngenta—one of our leading agritech companies—will be taken over by ChemChina, backed by the Chinese Government? What will that do for our competitiveness and our supply chains? Why will he not meet a cross-party group of MPs that has begged to meet him?	2016-03-15a.779.6	person/10534	person/24854	False	2016-03-15	cameron	False	False	0	Business, Energy And Industrial Strategy	Business, Innovation And Skills	Balance Of Trade: Services	0	labourco-operative	False	False	conservative	True	False
2016-03-15.5.2	I agree with my hon Friend that it is clear that trade agreements can lead to more trade with those countries and reduce any other barriers. Through the EU we have access to over 50 trade agreements at the moment, whereas other countries such as the US or China have 14-odd trade agreements. I agree that we need to focus a lot more on trade, but the trade agreements to which we have access today are very valuable in terms of global trade, not just with the EU.	2016-03-15a.780.1	Our strong performance in services is still not enough to offset the difficulties we are having with our trade with the European Union, with which we now have an annual trade deficit of £62 billion. Given that non-EU trade exports have increased by 30% since 2010, is not it clear that the best future for this country is to be outside the European Union, so that we can negotiate free trade agreements with China, India, Brazil, the Commonwealth and the rest of the world?	2016-03-15a.780.0	person/11661	person/24854	False	2016-03-15	cameron	False	False	0	Business, Energy And Industrial Strategy	Business, Innovation And Skills	Balance Of Trade: Services	0	conservative	True	False	conservative	True	False
2016-03-15.5.3	I am not sure whether it is to do with regulations, because all the other markets that the hon Gentleman mentions have also had to look at regulations after the financial crisis. However, he rightly highlights a general productivity problem across British industry in all sectors, where we are some 25 points behind with our G7 competitors. That is why we have a productivity plan, working with industry to turn that around.	2016-03-15a.780.3	Is the Secretary of State aware that productivity in our flagship service industry—financial services—has fallen behind similar productivity in the United States, in France, and even in Italy? Can he explain that? Is it something to do with the regulations that his Government have imposed on financial services?	2016-03-15a.780.2	person/25325	person/24854	False	2016-03-15	cameron	False	False	0	Business, Energy And Industrial Strategy	Business, Innovation And Skills	Balance Of Trade: Services	0	scottish-national-party	False	False	conservative	True	False
2016-03-15.6.0	I understand that this risk was assessed as low; nevertheless, it is very important that the company deal with it. My hon Friend’s local trading standards service has informed us that it is satisfied that the company is taking this matter seriously. I am sure that the company will want to pay particular attention to this constituent since his case has been raised in the House of Commons.	2016-03-15a.781.0	My constituent Mr Clive Davison has raised a concern about the delay in having his faulty Hotpoint tumble dryer fixed. There is real concern about this, given the risk of fire with these products.

I will make sure that I have a conversation with the hon Gentleman to understand what continuing concerns he has and to make sure that we address them.	2016-03-15a.781.2	The Minister referred to the Consumer Rights Act. When the Bill that became that Act was going through the House, I tabled a number of amendments to address the issue of unsafe and faulty electrical goods, and the then Minister gave a series of assurances and arguments that now appear to be hollow when we see the campaigning work by Electrical Safety First and by the Daily Mirror .

2016-03-15.6.2	I am afraid that it is rather typical of the Opposition to assume that unless there is public money, and public money that is always growing, it is impossible to enforce rights. Trading standards services are merely one of the enforcement mechanisms for consumer rights. Consumers can enforce their own rights, as established by the Consumer Rights Act, and trading standards services are working more efficiently across the country.	2016-03-15a.781.4	Today is World Consumer Rights Day. The Consumer Rights Act was trumpeted as bringing a new era of simplified, clearer consumer laws. However, most trading standards services have cut their staff by at least 40% since 2010.

It is not enough to say it; they should be doing it as well.	2016-03-15a.782.0	We welcome the creation of a small business commissioner as part of the Enterprise Bill, but given that last year’s National Audit Office report showed that four Departments were failing to meet the Government’s payment deadlines, why were public sector contracts not included?	2016-03-15a.781.8	person/25034	person/24772	True	2016-03-15	cameron	False	False	0	Business, Energy And Industrial Strategy	Business, Innovation And Skills	Prompt Payment	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False
2016-03-15.8.0	It is a pleasure to agree with the hon Gentleman, who might now become my hon Friend on this matter. We are undoubtedly, as I have said, better remaining a member of the European Union, not just for the sake of the larger companies but because, as he rightly identifies, the effects extend all the way through the supply chains, which often encompass the smaller companies. I encourage him to urge the leader of the Labour party to make sure that it puts its full weight behind the “stronger in” campaign. He would be better off doing that than engaging with CND rallies.	2016-03-15a.782.5	Toyota UK and Airbus UK are two anchor companies heading huge supply chains in north-east Wales that employ tens of thousands of people. Does the Minister agree that it would be absolute madness to throw those anchors away by risking leaving the European Union, and placing jobs in Wales and the rest of the UK at risk?	2016-03-15a.782.4	person/11057	person/24772	True	2016-03-15	cameron	False	False	0	Business, Energy And Industrial Strategy	Business, Innovation And Skills	Brexit: Exports	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False
2016-03-15.8.1	Of course. It was a great pleasure to come to the hon Gentleman’s constituency and specifically to see Bombardier’s excellent C Series plane and the construction of its wings. I am delighted to say that I am doing everything I can—indeed, we all are—to make sure that UKTI is properly used by all industries, especially the one that he represents, to increase sales, including those of the C Series plane. It is an excellent plane.	2016-03-15a.782.7	The right hon Lady knows that planes have the great ability to cross borders without pesky border controls. I have found her to be a champion for Bombardier and the C Series in my constituency, so will she confirm that she will continue the discussions with UK Trade & Investment and secure sales for the C Series aircraft, irrespective of what happens on 23 June ?	2016-03-15a.782.6	person/25280	person/24772	False	2016-03-15	cameron	False	False	0	Business, Energy And Industrial Strategy	Business, Innovation And Skills	Brexit: Exports	0	dup	False	False	conservative	True	False
2016-03-15.8.2	As I have already said, we are indeed stronger, safer and better off in the European Union. I am delighted that the leader of my party, the Prime Minister, is leading the campaign for us to remain in the European Union. If I may say so, I was told only yesterday that the majority of Conservative MPs support the Prime Minister in “stronger in”. However, I will make the point yet again that, unfortunately, the leader of the Labour party is failing in his duty to play a full part. He goes on CND rallies instead of supporting Trident, for example, and instead of getting out there and supporting “stronger in”.	2016-03-15a.783.1	Since 1995, Europe’s share of commercial aviation manufacturing has risen from 16% to 57% of the world market because of the co-operation between France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom. Would the Minister not be better off having a word with some of her own colleagues than worrying about the Labour party, which is united in its support for remaining in the European Union? Does not that statistic provide a practical and potent example, which she can use with her Back Benchers and supporters, of why it is absolutely in the UK’s long-term interest to remain in the European Union?	2016-03-15a.783.0	person/10753	person/24772	False	2016-03-15	cameron	False	False	0	Business, Energy And Industrial Strategy	Business, Innovation And Skills	Brexit: Exports	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False
2016-03-15.9.0	Yes, I will. Let me congratulate my hon Friend on the hard work he has already put in during his short time in his new role. He will know that there has been an increase of 137% in apprenticeship starts in his constituency in the past five years. He is absolutely right to raise the importance of degree apprenticeships, because he knows this is about quality, not just quantity. I welcome the report from Universities UK today on this issue, because we will do everything we can to support more degree apprenticeships.	2016-03-15a.783.7	In national apprenticeship week, we can all welcome the creation of over 2.6 million apprenticeships since May 2010, including 500,000 in the midlands and 5,140 in my constituency of North Warwickshire. Will the Secretary of State join me in welcoming a report published today by Universities UK? It shows the potential for new degree apprenticeships to help to meet the needs of employers in my constituency and across the whole country, and to encourage more universities to deliver these important degree apprenticeship courses.	2016-03-15a.783.6	person/25290	person/24854	True	2016-03-15	cameron	False	False	0	Business, Energy And Industrial Strategy	Business, Innovation And Skills	Regional Growth: Midlands	0	conservative	True	False	conservative	True	False

I know that my hon Friend has already contacted his local trading standards officers, who in turn have contacted the police, and an investigation is taking place. As a result, I am confident that the message will be put out so that we can stop the import of laser pens, which is another reason I want to work with the European Union. I cannot see how on earth it can be right that it is legal to sell these pens as toys, because they are clearly not.	2016-03-15a.784.7	As the Minister knows, I told her about the case of a seven-year-old boy in my constituency who was almost blinded last year by a laser pen he had purchased at a Christmas fair. The problem is that laser pens are very dangerous but are being marketed to children as toys.

2016-03-15.11.0	I think that the right hon Gentleman, who is a very consistent champion not just of apprenticeships but of high-quality apprenticeships, should in some sense actually be encouraged. The steps we are taking—to insist, first, that an apprenticeship must last a minimum of 12 months, and secondly, that the training content of the apprenticeship is relatively rigorous—are flushing out poor-quality training provision, which is having a temporary effect on completion rates. As he knows, we propose to put employers in charge of the money. They will commission the training provision, and they will have a very strong interest in ensuring that as many apprentices as possible complete the programme.	2016-03-15a.785.4	There has been a drop. The Minister knows my concern that achieving his quantitative apprenticeship target might be done at the expense of quality, and there is a falling completion figure, as he said. There seems to be a particular problem in London in this respect. Does he have any further proposals for improving the position on apprenticeship completions?	2016-03-15a.785.3	person/10596	person/24766	True	2016-03-15	cameron	False	False	0	Business, Energy And Industrial Strategy	Business, Innovation And Skills	Apprenticeships	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False
2016-03-15.11.1	I agree with my hon Friend, because although that figure is encouraging, it is a tiny percentage of the total number of apprenticeship starts every year. We want more higher apprenticeships and more degree apprenticeships—as championed by the Secretary of State—so that people see that they can start an apprenticeship at any level and go anywhere.	2016-03-15a.785.6	With 19,800 higher apprenticeship starts in the past year—an increase of more than 115%, which includes nearly 3,600 in my constituency—may I congratulate the Government on what they have done so far, and urge the Minister to go further and faster?	2016-03-15a.785.5	person/25422	person/24766	False	2016-03-15	cameron	False	False	0	Business, Energy And Industrial Strategy	Business, Innovation And Skills	Apprenticeships	0	conservative	True	False	conservative	True	False
2016-03-15.12.0	I think the Opposition will find that they are on a hiding to nothing if they try consistently to pick holes in and talk down the apprenticeship programme, which is dramatically successful and dramatically popular. Of course some people will not complete their apprenticeship, because an apprenticeship is not just a training programme; it is a job, and sometimes employers will decide that someone is not suited to continuing in that job. We want standards to go up and we want more numbers. Frankly, it would be good to have a bit of support from the Opposition for a programme that they claim to have invented.	2016-03-15a.786.0	"May I associate myself with the Secretary of State’s advocacy of national apprenticeship week, which of course the
Labour Government started? It is worrying to learn that the number of people who completed apprenticeships in London last year, compared with the number who started them, is only 50%. Across England, similar statistics show that only 52% of people completed their apprenticeships, which is a drop of 6% on the previous year. The latest number of apprenticeships started in leisure, travel and tourism is down by 40% on 2010, and as the
Financial Times
told us, and as we heard today, only 4% of female apprentices take up engineering. Does the Minister agree that women—50% of the population—and the service sector must be crucial elements for his 3 million apprenticeship target? How will he have the muscle to achieve that, given the 23% cut in apprentice service staffing in the past nine months alone, and with more cuts to come?"	2016-03-15a.785.9	person/10415	person/24766	False	2016-03-15	cameron	False	False	0	Business, Energy And Industrial Strategy	Business, Innovation And Skills	Apprenticeships	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False

The point she makes, which I would like to emphasise to the Opposition spokeswoman, the hon Member for Newcastle upon Tyne Central (Chi Onwurah) , is why we have brought forward Labour’s target by two years. We have achieved by the end of 2015 what Labour planned to achieve by the end of 2017.	2016-03-15a.787.4	I thank the Minister for his response, but my constituent in Upper Denby is struggling to run a business with broadband speeds of no more than 1.8 megabits. He is not due to get superfast broadband until July 2017 at the earliest. Broadband in 2016 is a necessity, not a luxury.

Broadband 4 the Rural North is a fantastic community broadband programme. We encourage lots of competition for BT and I am pleased that B4RN is thriving and providing an excellent service to her constituents.	2016-03-15a.787.6	Many of my rural and farming constituents are looking to diversify, and are setting up their own businesses and working from home. Frustrated with the wait for BT to deliver superfast broadband, many have been left in the position of digging their own trenches and working with Broadband 4 the Rural North to deliver superfast broadband so that they can run their businesses.

I note that, in a week when we had a significant increase in the national minimum wage and a month before the national living wage comes in, the Opposition are attempting to say that these interventions will actually be damaging for the people they represent, rather than substantially boosting their incomes.	2016-03-15a.789.2	I was a comprehensive school girl who left school at 16, so social mobility is very important to me, and I am pleased to be involved in the new inquiry by the all-party parliamentary group on social mobility into getting people from diverse backgrounds into top professions.

As somebody who was self-employed for many years, I am fully aware of this issue. We are looking at the excellent report that has been produced and seeing how we can encourage more people to start up their own business and, if they are self-employed, ensure they get a better deal.	2016-03-15a.790.1	Given the large number of young people interested in becoming self-employed or setting up their own business, will my right hon Friend tell the House what steps are being taken to help the next generation of entrepreneurs achieve their ambitions?	2016-03-15a.790.0	person/24820	person/24772	False	2016-03-15	cameron	False	True	0	Business, Energy And Industrial Strategy	Business, Innovation And Skills	Topical Questions	0	conservative	True	False	conservative	True	False

He will have just heard from the Minister for Small Business, Industry and Enterprise, my right hon Friend the Member for Broxtowe (Anna Soubry) about the Pubs Code Adjudicator, which I think is a very positive development. I have heard my hon Friend loud and clear on the desire for a further cut, and I know he has made his representations to the Chancellor. When I was Economic Secretary to the Treasury, I recall getting a beer named after me—Sajid’s Choice, which was a fine brew—so there are many reasons to cut beer duty.	2016-03-15a.790.5	The Secretary of State will know that the beer and pub industry in the west midlands employs 86,000 people in 5,000 pubs, has 124 breweries and contributes £1.3 billion in tax.

The current rate of participation in apprenticeships is not too bad—I think it is about 8.8%—but we can always do more. We need to ensure that the requirements for the qualifications, particularly in English and maths, that some people have to acquire as part of their apprenticeships do not discriminate against those who are disabled.	2016-03-15a.793.1	The Government have pledged to halve the disability employment gap.

1999-07-27.0.0	The concordats will be published once they have been agreed by the Scottish Executive and the Government. I can tell the hon Gentleman that the concordats do exist. They are there to promote concord between the two Parliaments in their working relationships. I am very sorry that the Opposition, including the Scottish National party and the Tories, have failed in their 20-year struggle to stop devolution, but the Scottish Parliament has been established; there is now a partnership of Parliaments; and it will succeed to the benefit of the Scottish people.	1999-07-27a.101.14	"I wonder whether, when the Secretary of State says that the arrangements ""will be"" set out in concordats, he means that the concordats do not exist.

1999-07-27.0.1	Yes. As my hon Friend knows, those of us who have promoted the devolution settlement have spent most of our political life arguing for the unity of the United Kingdom and against the separatists and their narrow brand of nationalism. Unfortunately, the mirror image of that narrow brand of Scottish nationalism seems to be creeping into the leadership of the Conservative party, which is fanning the flames of English nationalism. Of course, in the wake of the devolution settlement, we shall have to change the superstructure. We are considering how we deal with matters in this House. Of course we shall reduce the number of Scottish Members of Parliament. Of course we shall consider, once the Parliament and devolved legislatures have settled in, the role of the Secretary of State. However, the one area that we should be very careful about tampering with is the essence of the unity of the United Kingdom, and that is ensuring that every Member of Parliament in this House is equal and stays equal.	1999-07-27a.102.0	"Does my right hon Friend agree that if changes are to be made to the way

1999-07-27.0.2	The unease that was referred to in the report—I take it that the hon Gentleman has read the report, not just the media reports of it—was the potential unease among those people who might see the most radical constitutional steps for three centuries taking place and wonder whether Scotland might fall under the hands of the incompetent narrow nationalists who sit on the Benches behind him. I can assure him that he can be well at ease on that basis. We have no intention—nor have the Scottish people—of allowing Scotland to be divorced from the United Kingdom. As regards the relationships between this Parliament and the Scottish Parliament, I can assure the hon Gentleman that there will be a partnership of Parliaments. They are united by the Labour Government leading here at Westminster and the Labour-led Administration in partnership in Holyrood.	1999-07-27a.102.2	In the annual report published by the Government yesterday there is a reference to unease at devolution. Does the Secretary of State accept that some of that unease is occurring because of an apparent turf war between his new Scotland Office and the Scottish Executive? Does he maintain, as he did at last week's Scottish Affairs Committee, that this is an entirely media-inspired turf war, or does he think that it is about time that politicians at all levels reversed the tanks off one other's lawns?	1999-07-27a.102.1	person/10439	person/10501	False	1999-07-27	blair	False	False	0	Scotland	Scotland	Liaison Arrangements	0	liberal-democrat	False	False	labour	True	False

recent speculation, I think that we would all be wise to remember exactly what is happening. For nearly two decades, there has been an alliance of forces against the devolution settlement. That settlement is the partnership of Parliaments. When we hear the names of Forsyth, Tebbit, Hague and the SNP, we recall that they have spent most of the last 20 years arguing against the establishment of one part of that settlement: the Scottish Parliament. They have utterly failed to stop that, and they are now directing their attack towards the other half of the settlement: Scottish partnership in the United Kingdom at the UK parliamentary level. We will not allow them to succeed in that attack, nor will the Scottish people.

Instead of the leader and parliamentary leader of his party putting in no appearance in this House, voting on nothing in this House, and asking no questions in this House, even during the period when the Scottish Parliament has not been sitting, SNP Members should stop taking money from a Parliament in which they do not believe, for what they are not doing.	1999-07-27a.103.1	In his liaison role with the Scottish Executive, will the Secretary of State discuss the remarks made yesterday by the First Minister's official spokesman to the effect that the other Ministers in the Scottish Executive are unproven and unqualified?

However, I assure my hon Friend that the First Minister and I are already involved in discussions to see that there is a symmetry of conventions. [HON.

I am sorry that we have to explain such things in words of one syllable to those on the Opposition Front Bench. The rights and responsibilities of each Parliament will be respected.

1999-07-27.0.6	Last week, apparently, Mr. McLetchie—who purports to lead the rump of the Conservative party in Scotland and is doing his best to disrupt the link between Scotland and the Union, which may be of interest to the hon Gentleman—claimed that I was too powerful. The claim from the Opposition today is that I am not powerful enough. Once they have sorted out their line on my status, I shall respond to the hon Gentleman's question. On the concordats, the reason for the delay, as I explained in great detail to the Select Committee, is that they are inextricably linked to the memorandum of understanding. The memorandum of understanding is not between one Administration—the Scottish Executive—and the Government. It is between all devolved Administrations and all Departments of Government—including the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the proposed devolved Assembly there. It may have escaped the hon Gentleman's notice that there has been some difficulty in recent weeks in reaching the final decision on the Irish situation. That is the main reason for the delay. There is no conspiracy. I would merely make one further point. The hon Gentleman and the SNP like to dwell on personalities, which is a sure sign that they have nothing whatever to say on policy, and the longer they deal in soap-opera politics, the more obvious to the Scottish people that fact will become.	1999-07-27a.104.1	May I assure the Secretary of State that when it comes to concord, we certainly desire it? Is it not the case, however, that the concord between him and the First Minister over the past few weeks has been somewhat subsonic? Has not the only means of communication between the Secretary of State and the First Minister been through the parliamentary Labour party—not a source of brotherly love and affection? Why are no concordats in place now, when the relationship should be up and running? Is the Secretary of State privy, for instance, to the internal paper round of the Scottish Executive? If not, is he not effectively cut out of all contact with decision making, save that which the First Minister wishes to give him? Is it not time to get away from the turf wars and lay some proper and open foundations for the relationship?	1999-07-27a.104.0	person/10243	person/10501	False	1999-07-27	blair	False	False	0	Scotland	Scotland	Liaison Arrangements	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False

When the people of Scotland listen to the criticisms that have been levelled by the leader of the Scottish National party and its parliamentary leader—[HON. MEMBERS: ""Where are they?""] I see that the leader of the SNP is not here today again. As that hon Gentleman is so interested in my role, I checked how many times since 2 July he had asked a question in the House—remember, this is when the Scottish Parliament is not sitting—and the answer was none at all. I checked how many times he had taken part in a debate, and the answer was none at all. And I checked how many times he had voted, and up until yesterday morning the answer was none at all—and I suspect that after the past 24 hours, it is none at all again. As I have said, people will want to ask what, exactly, moneys, allowances and Short money from this Parliament are being paid to the SNP for, since SNP Members are taking money from a Parliament in which they do not believe for something that they are not doing."	1999-07-27a.105.1	Despite the confusion that the chattering classes have sown in the Scottish media, I welcome what my right hon Friend says about issues such as taxation, social security and other matters which remain the clear responsibility of this House.

I have heard that called empire building, but it will surely be the first empire where the leader will know each member by his or her first name. Secondly, I have rejected the idea of a separate residence, and that is precisely why I have authorised negotiations on offices in Edinburgh where 20 of the 26 rooms will be allocated to civil servants. I did not want a separate residence.

We have to consider the fact that more guidance might be necessary, but, if we are in the world of grown-up politics, we should realise that we cannot carry out constitutional change of such magnitude without having to work through problems. The First Minister and I are attempting to do that—in a businesslike fashion and in partnership. I believe that that partnership is immensely beneficial to the Scottish people and it is certainly their preference. The one thing they want is people working together in partnership; the one thing they oppose is divorcing Scotland from the United Kingdom.	1999-07-27a.106.0	"My right hon Friend the Member for Coatbridge and

Beneath that is the brigade, which I do not have. Beneath that is the battalion, which I do not have. Beneath that is the regiment, which I do not have. Beneath that is the company, which is what I have. My company consists of about 100 people. The hon Gentleman seems to be concerned about expense and the £5 million, but he obviously did not notice that all the details were issued by the Treasury on 31 March. They were available to him but, like his colleagues, he was probably not here. If the SNP spent a little bit of time working for its money, it would have been able to find out about these matters. The £5 million to which he refers is 0.03 per cent. of the Scottish Office budget. Let us consider what the SNP is receiving. I do not mind the hon Gentleman taking two salaries and two parliamentary allowances, if he does so, but I know— [Interruption.] He may not, but I know that the SNP takes two lots of Short money: £134,000 here and £170,000 in the Scottish Parliament. In addition, it voted itself another £1 million in allowances at Scottish parliamentary level. If SNP Members are taking that sort of money, they should do some work here occasionally to represent the interests of the Scottish people.	1999-07-27a.106.2	The Secretary of State's Department has fewer responsibilities than at any time in its history, so why is he amassing an army of up to 130 civil servants with an annual budget of £5 million taken from the Scottish Parliament, which could be better spent by it in providing services for the Scottish people? Why is he undermining his own Government's devolution settlement while Scottish Executive Ministers are openly and publicly squabbling among themselves?	1999-07-27a.106.1	person/10628	person/10501	False	1999-07-27	blair	False	False	0	Scotland	Scotland	Reserved Powers	0	scottish-national-party	False	False	labour	True	False
1999-07-27.1.4	The reference to North and Fox reminds me that we should keep off the subject of foxes in the present context because other people will get tetchy. I was not at all tetchy. If the hon Gentleman wants me to go through the whole list again I shall do so, but I suspect that he does not. My main role in the House is to represent the interests of the Scottish people in all the reserved matters, which he well knows. My other role is to promote the devolution settlement. I have to play a part in negotiations on payment of the block grant and I also have some residual functions. As the hon Gentleman well knows, the nature of collective government means that it is important for Scotland to have its interests represented in Cabinet discussions on such matters, and for the position of the Scottish people to be made clear. If the hon Gentleman tells me that, logically, no one who does not have to make the ultimate departmental decision for anything can play an important role, I would remind him that the total departmental role of the Prime Minister is national security and honours. I hope that he would not suggest that the Prime Minister has no authority or power.	1999-07-27a.107.0	"The right hon Gentleman, who was such a marvellous Minister for the Armed Forces, should not allow himself to become so tetchy merely because he is now a member of a


partnership more improbable than any since Fox and North. For the benefit of everyone concerned, will he devote a little time during the forthcoming recess to compiling a list of those matters for which he is responsible as Secretary of State? He read out a great litany from the Dispatch Box during the last Scottish Question Time, but he was responsible for not one of those matters. We want to know what he is doing for his money."	1999-07-27a.106.3	person/10134	person/10501	False	1999-07-27	blair	False	False	0	Scotland	Scotland	Reserved Powers	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False

and London. I shall pass on my hon Friend's representations to my right hon Friend the Minister for Transport."	1999-07-27a.107.5	The Minister will be aware that, today, the Government announced that British Airways can acquire the City Flyer Aviation Company, with the proviso that it gives up slots at Gatwick. He will also be aware of the great problem, at both Gatwick and Heathrow, in providing slots for vital regional services, which are essential for business and tourism. Will he agree to make representations to the Minister for Transport to fight for those slots at Gatwick and Heathrow for vital regional services, such as the Inverness-London route?	1999-07-27a.107.4	person/10568	person/10382	True	1999-07-27	blair	False	False	0	Scotland	Scotland	Regional Air Services	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
1999-07-27.2.1	The hon Lady might be quoting that gentleman slightly out of context. The key point that Mr. Grant was trying to make was that there is concern that the good service between Inverness and Gatwick will be upgraded so that it goes directly to Heathrow, but that that should not be seen as a reflection on the good service that already exists between Inverness and London.	1999-07-27a.108.1	Does the Minister share my concern that the chairman of Highlands and Islands airport has said that services can be secured from Scottish airports only for people living in Glasgow and Edinburgh?

1999-07-27.3.0	I commend to the House and to people in Scotland the working families tax credit which the Chancellor intends to introduce. This is another major step forward in ensuring that our economic competence is matched by social justice. More than 140,000 families in Scotland will benefit, with a minimum wage of £200 per week for families with one worker. That is part of our fight for social justice in Scotland, and is in addition to the 200,000 people who benefit from the minimum wage, the £1.8 billion extra on the health service, the £1.3 billion extra going into education, the lowest rate of inflation, mortgages and interest rates that we have had for a long time, and the lowest rate of unemployment in Scotland for 20 years. That is testimony to the competence of the Chancellor and the Government, and is the necessary platform to ensure that the lives of people in Scotland will improve year by year under the Labour Government in partnership with the Labour-led Administration in Edinburgh.	1999-07-27a.109.0	"I thank the Secretary of State for his reply. He will be fully aware that the working families tax credit will be introduced in October. How many Scottish


families will benefit from that measure?

1999-07-27.3.1	The hon Gentleman is trying to surpass his hon Friend the Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon) in getting facts wrong. He may have misread yesterday's press. The Labour Government's first target for Scotland was to deliver the Parliament, which we have done; the second was economic stability, and he will be aware that we have achieved that; and the third was to reduce waiting lists to below 75,000 by 2002. I am pleased that the hon Gentleman has given me the opportunity to tell the House that we met that target two and a half years ahead of schedule when, one month ago, we reduced waiting lists in Scotland to below 75,000.	1999-07-27a.109.2	If the economy in Scotland is being managed so successfully, why are class sizes and waiting lists increasing?	1999-07-27a.109.1	person/10490	person/10501	False	1999-07-27	blair	False	False	0	Scotland	Scotland	Economy	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
1999-07-27.3.2	"I agree with my hon Friend. There is no greater blight on a civilised society than poverty in families and among children and our senior citizens. That is why I am proud that the Chancellor's custodianship of our economy has allowed people in Scotland the biggest-ever increase in child benefit. I am also proud that we were able to increase the Christmas bonus for pensioners to £100, and that, in addition to the minimum wage, which has lifted hundreds of thousands in Scotland above their previous position, the working families tax credit will benefit 140,000 more families in Scotland,

including a considerable number of children. For old folks, families and young people in Scotland, the Labour Government are beginning to make life better than it ever was before."	1999-07-27a.109.4	Does my right hon Friend agree that tackling low pay and family poverty has been a priority for the Government, unlike the previous Government, who believed that no income level was too low for a family to live on as long as it did not affect them or their supporters? Does he also agree that the minimum wage and the working families tax credit—both introduced this year—will lift thousands of Scottish families out of poverty? Those measures will start to end the national disgrace that we inherited from the previous Government which is that, at the end of the 20th century, one in four children are still living in poverty.	1999-07-27a.109.3	person/10562	person/10501	False	1999-07-27	blair	False	False	0	Scotland	Scotland	Economy	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
1999-07-27.4.0	"I will try to ensure that the hon Gentleman's last request is met to the benefit of hon Members. I thank the hon Gentleman for his comments about the assisted areas map. I think that the solution for Scotland was a fair one, which met Scotland's needs and resulted from the very partnership that I mentioned earlier. Not only did the Prime Minister negotiate a safety net for the United Kingdom, but I assure the hon Gentleman that the First Minister and I worked closely together. I think that the resulting 49 per cent. coverage was very fair. We should bear in mind that the United Kingdom is now much more prosperous than it was in Europe when the last map was drawn up, and that, owing to the present Government's policies, Scotland is now much more prosperous in the United Kingdom than it was. As I say, I think that the settlement was fair. As for objective 2, I cannot give the hon Gentleman guarantees in regard to areas. We must ensure that the method of targeting is as efficient as possible. Because


we are now more prosperous, we can expect a diminution in the number of people who will be covered in Scotland. I will, however, attempt to ensure that the hon Gentleman's comments are brought to the attention of all who are involved in the planning."	1999-07-27a.110.4	The reintroduction of regional selective assistance in parts of the Scottish borders region on 15 July was warmly welcomed. However, as I am sure the Secretary of State will acknowledge, not every community in the region can be included in the eligible area map. That puts extra pressure on communities such as Jedburgh in my constituency which have been left out. The local people are perplexed about that, and feel that no one is responding to their needs. When the European structural funds announcement on objective 2 is made, will the Secretary of State bear that in mind? Will he ensure that the whole Scottish borders region receives some coverage, so that compensating measures can be applied to communities that have not been given assisted area status? Will he also use all his powers to ensure that Members of Parliament are given adequate notice of the announcement, which will probably be made during the recess, and that we do not have to read about it in the newspapers?	1999-07-27a.110.3	person/10345	person/10501	True	1999-07-27	blair	False	False	0	Scotland	Scotland	Regional Aid	0	liberal-democrat	False	False	labour	True	False

I will certainly meet him but, as I think he will accept, the settlement regarding the assisted areas map was very fair from our point of view. We worked it out in partnership with our colleagues in the United Kingdom Parliament. When a final announcement is made, it will be possible to make some technical adjustments to the map, but I do not hold out the probability of major adjustments.	1999-07-27a.111.1	I welcome the world-based approach to regional selective assistance, but would the Secretary of State be willing to meet me to discuss the impact of the new approach on my constituency?	1999-07-27a.111.0	person/10661	person/10501	False	1999-07-27	blair	False	False	0	Scotland	Scotland	Regional Aid	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

I do not know whether he had a chance to meet members of a group which is devoted to the cause of increasing use of the internet by the elderly, and which operates under the intriguing name Hairnet. They rightly argue that the elderly have most to gain from the increased use of the world wide web, along with those who are housebound, disabled or infirm.

Departments share papers with each other for specific purposes. The Scotland Executive shares information with us for a specific purpose as well—so that we can represent effectively the interests of the Scottish people within the United Kingdom Government, as my right hon Friend the Secretary of State said.	1999-07-27a.112.1	I am delighted to hear that the Scotland Office website will come back into operation after the disappearance of the Scottish Office one. Can the Minister help the House a little? In answer to an earlier question, the Secretary of State described some of his roles—a much more modest list than the one that he gave a month ago. Will the website tell us how he carries out his job? For example, is he privy to the paper round of the Scottish Executive? Is that how he obtains his information on the day-to-day running of Scotland? Will that be on the website? In addition, will the website identify what all his staff—that small company—are actually doing, what their remit is, what Departments they are covering, and whether they are duplicating the roles of civil servants in London, or of civil servants within the Scottish Executive? Will all that go on the website so that we can all know exactly what is happening?	1999-07-27a.112.0	person/10243	person/10382	False	1999-07-27	blair	False	False	0	Scotland	Scotland	Websites	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False

Secondly, I assure him that, as I have been doing, I shall continue working closely and in a businesslike fashion with the First Minister for the benefit of the Scottish people. It goes without saying—but bears repeating—that the Scottish people are extremely well served in their First Minister.

The Lord Chancellor can perform that function because of his seniority in the Cabinet, because he is head of the judiciary and because he is so widely respected in the profession.	1999-07-27a.116.6	In the first Session of this Parliament, the Lord Chancellor described himself as the Prime Minister's Cardinal Wolsey. He now says that he is the buffer between the Executive and the judiciary. Evidently he cannot perform both roles.

Whether bulwark or buffer, does not the Lord Chancellor recognise that perhaps his description of himself in his speech to that conference might be greeted by hollow laughter by many members of the legal profession who remember that the Lord Chancellor is perhaps the Prime Minister's oldest crony? Perhaps many members of the legal profession who traditionally have supported the Government party might nevertheless be concerned that this Lord Chancellor does not regard himself as the defender of the legal profession, but is very much in the Prime Minister's pocket.	1999-07-27a.117.1	person/10264	person/10614	False	1999-07-27	blair	False	False	0	Lord Chancellor	Lord Chancellor'S Department	Judiciary (Communication)	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
1999-07-27.11.0	I have not seen the advertisement so it is extremely difficult to comment on it. As the hon Gentleman correctly realises, this is a matter for the planning inspectorate and for my right hon Friend the Deputy Prime Minister. However, if the hon Gentleman sends me the advertisement, I will have a look at it.	1999-07-27a.118.0	"I am grateful for that assurance. As planning inspectors are involved in a judicial capacity—albeit on matters relating to town and country planning—does the Minister share my outrage that a recent advertisement asking people to apply to become planning inspectors included the phrase, ""Freemasons need not apply""? The Minister may say that this is a matter for the Deputy Prime Minister. However, as it is

such an outrageous unfairness, may I ask him to ask the Lord Chancellor to consult the Deputy Prime Minister on the incident?"	1999-07-27a.117.6	person/10099	person/10614	True	1999-07-27	blair	False	False	0	Lord Chancellor	Lord Chancellor'S Department	Judiciary (Independence)	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
1999-07-27.11.1	My hon Friend is absolutely right. Of course the judiciary is above party politics. As I have said on numerous occasions in this House, our judiciary is the best in the world. We have people of the highest quality who are full of integrity. It is quite wrong for people to attack judges in that way, knowing that they do not have the means to reply.	1999-07-27a.118.2	Is not the independence of the judiciary from political sniping particularly important when a judge is conducting an independent tribunal? My question is prompted by the sniping by some at Lord Saville, who is conducting the Bloody Sunday inquiry.	1999-07-27a.118.1	person/10230	person/10614	False	1999-07-27	blair	False	False	0	Lord Chancellor	Lord Chancellor'S Department	Judiciary (Independence)	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

Does my hon Friend appreciate that there is concern in Wales that his Department has been slow in producing Welsh language schemes as required under the Welsh Language Act 1993?

2003-12-18.0.0	I am grateful to my hon Friend, who chairs an all-party committee that has been looking at this matter. The Basel accord is a voluntary arrangement that involves the banks. The EU directive that will flow from it will include financial institutions. I gather that a separate directive will cover the insurance industry, but this House would debate all those matters before any directive was agreed.	2003-12-18.1701.7	I thank my right hon Friend for that reply.

2003-12-18.0.1	I suspect that the rest of the hon Gentleman's party are using their credit cards and injecting spending into the economy at this very moment, so that we can meet our growth target with greater confidence. His question was more about credit cards than the Basel accord, but I can tell him that I welcome the report from the Treasury Committee. It is clear that issues of transparency are involved, and that the various organisations mentioned in the report—the Office of Fair Trading and the Financial Services Authority, among others—will want to look at the recommendations. It is in no one's interest that there is either irresponsible lending or irresponsible borrowing. I hope that he welcomed the consumer credit White Paper that was published a few days ago.	2003-12-18.1701.9	Can the Chancellor confirm that one of the objectives of risk-based regulation under the Basel accord is the prevention of dangerous booms and busts in bank lending? Will he therefore explain why, at a national level, no one is taking responsibility for the often reckless debt promotion by the leading banks and credit card companies? Given yesterday's conclusions of the Treasury Committee, does that not suggest that the Government and the regulators are either blind or asleep where the banks are concerned?	2003-12-18.1701.8	person/10084	person/10068	False	2003-12-18	blair	False	False	0	Treasury	Treasury	Basel Ii Accords	0	liberal-democrat	False	False	labour	True	False

I hope that people named by the Treasury Committee will look at the report's conclusions. I know that my hon Friend has also taken an interest in the Basel accord, and it is true that it involves the G10. However, in the nature of things, other countries took up the recommendations in the previous Basel accord. As far as America is concerned, all those involved are working to the mid-2004 deadline. Despite the comments two days ago by one of the US regulators, I am assured that the intention is to complete the work as soon as possible. That will lead to implementation not in 2005 but in 2006. At the same time, we will be discussing an EU directive. That would not be voluntary: it would be a statutory guideline for banks and some financial institutions as well.	2003-12-18.1702.1	I assume that my right hon Friend the Chancellor will be using his credit card prudently over the Christmas period. However, India and China are not included in the Basel II accords, and the USA is rumoured to be unwilling to sign up.

2003-12-18.1.0	I was going to offer my hon Friend a Christmas present from the Treasury, but it is clear that he does not need one. He is absolutely right. In the typical constituency, £200 million more has been invested in each year since 1997. That has meant that we are able to pay for nurses, teachers, doctors and classroom assistants. The whole House will understand that that would not have been possible if we had reduced public spending by £80 billion, as the Conservatives plan.	2003-12-18.1702.6	I thank my right hon Friend for that reply. I hope that he will take the opportunity of coming to visit my constituency to see the success of the increased public spending. We have a new further education college, a new police station, four new roundabouts, a new bypass, two new Sure Start projects, and work has just started on the building of a new hospital. I am sure that he will agree that it is no coincidence that all that success has been achieved under a Labour Government.	2003-12-18.1702.5	person/10834	person/10068	True	2003-12-18	blair	False	False	0	Treasury	Treasury	Public Expenditure (West Cumbria)	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

As for the new deal, not only has my hon Friend's constituency seen a very big reduction in unemployment, but unemployment rates in almost every one of the constituencies of Conservative Front Benchers are now 2 per cent. or below."	2003-12-18.1703.4	I thank the Chancellor for that answer. There is a great deal for which we are thankful in South Derbyshire, with those who are unemployed and claiming benefit now numbering only 850—1,100 fewer than when the Government came to power. I would welcome his response to my gentle suggestion that he clarify the future of the export credits guarantee scheme, which is critical to the future of companies such as Rolls-Royce, which employs many of the workers in my area.	2003-12-18.1703.3	person/10598	person/10068	True	2003-12-18	blair	False	False	0	Treasury	Treasury	Employment Assistance	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2003-12-18.2.1	I thought that the hon Gentleman was going to congratulate us on the 60 per cent. cut in unemployment in his constituency since 1997. The reason why he did not is that the Conservatives want to abolish the very instrument for getting unemployment down—the new deal. He will know that it is completely untrue to say that two thirds of jobs created since 1997 have been created in the public sector. The fact is that 1.24 million jobs have been created in the private sector. Conservative Members should be congratulating us on having the lowest unemployment rate of any of the major countries—something that they never achieved in 18 years of government.	2003-12-18.1703.6	Will the Chancellor confirm that two thirds of the new jobs created this year are in the public sector and that, although many of them may be very worth while jobs in nursing and teaching, they all have to be paid for by the wealth-creating sector?	2003-12-18.1703.5	person/10194	person/10068	False	2003-12-18	blair	False	False	0	Treasury	Treasury	Employment Assistance	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False

The fact that the Conservatives would abolish the new deal shows that they have learned nothing from the mistakes of the past.	2003-12-18.1704.1	In Bristol, the new deal has been particularly successful in getting young people into work.

The hon Gentleman has welcomed the new deal—he should have a Christmas lunch with the shadow Chancellor, who said that the new deal is an expensive failure. They must reconcile those contradictory positions.	2003-12-18.1704.3	"In a spirit of Christmas cheer, I congratulate the Chancellor and the Government on their job creation efforts, which have gone well—there is no denying that. [Hon Members: ""Oh!""] Well, fair play. However, may I encourage the Chancellor to look again at the growing level of regulation, which is depressing job creation in the wealth-generating sector?"	2003-12-18.1704.2	person/11245	person/10068	False	2003-12-18	blair	False	False	0	Treasury	Treasury	Employment Assistance	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2003-12-18.2.4	Christmas cheer is around at the moment and I respect my hon Friend's work, undertaken even when he was ill, in promoting coalfield regeneration. We will look back on the past few years as an attempt to resurrect communities that were left with terrible problems as a result of the way in which the coal industry was run down in the 1980s. I shall consider his proposal for Bolsover, but he should know that the new deal for communities is being expanded. There are now 2,000 designated enterprise areas, with huge incentives for development. We are intent on not only keeping unemployment low but tackling areas of continuing long-term unemployment that deserve the support of a compassionate Government.	2003-12-18.1704.5	Is the Chancellor of the Exchequer aware that, in coalfield areas, particularly Derbyshire, the Tories took the pits out of the public sector, put them into the private sector and then shut every single one? Since 1997, we have had the mammoth task of trying to rejuvenate those areas. That has been a huge success, but we still have one pending—the Bolsover-Markham employment zone, near junction 29A off the M1. Five thousand jobs will materialise in that area. Will he ensure that as the planning applications have not been called in we can have a Christmas present for all the people in north Derbyshire?	2003-12-18.1704.4	person/10544	person/10068	False	2003-12-18	blair	False	False	0	Treasury	Treasury	Employment Assistance	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

He must realise that the economy is stronger than it has ever been, with 1.7 million more people in work, interest rates at their lowest since 1955 and net wealth, including property prices, rising.	2003-12-18.1705.6	For licensees and others, the tax is half-baked and hideously bureaucratic, yet the real scandal is the increase in the tax burden, to which my hon Friend the Member for Leominster (Mr. Wiggin) referred. Since 1997, stamp duty has been increased four times, and now we have discovered a fifth increase. Tucked away on page 217—how surprising—of the pre-Budget report is the information that the Government expect stamp duty revenue to rise from £7.5 billion this year to £9.3 billion next year. Given that property prices are expected to rise next year by 8 per cent., how do the Government plan to secure an increase of 24 per cent. in revenue?	2003-12-18.1705.5	person/11172	person/10332	False	2003-12-18	blair	False	False	0	Treasury	Treasury	Stamp Duty Land Tax	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2003-12-18.4.0	My hon Friend is right about the value of the warm homes initiative. Indeed, in the past couple of weeks, I visited constituents, Mr. and Mrs. Cowdell, in Wath upon Dearne. They, like some of my hon Friend's constituents, have benefited from the programme by insulating their home, cutting their bills and being kept warm throughout the winter for the first time in their lives. His points about trying to ensure that our measures improve energy efficiency and reduce domestic fuel poverty are well made. The pre-Budget report confirms that we see the case for using more economic instruments in this area to promote energy efficiency and reduce fuel poverty in the home. The work is complicated at present by a review of the reduced rates of VAT in Europe and by a review within government of corporation tax, but we are working hard on these measures and hope to make announcements on the budget cycle in due course.	2003-12-18.1706.1	I know that we made a commitment in the pre-Budget statement to introduce further measures on energy efficiency in the home. However, will my hon Friend ensure that he, the Chancellor and Treasury team pay special attention to the warnings that we have just received from the Government's fuel poverty adviser that, unless there is a dramatic increase in the warm homes programme, we will fail to meet our commitments to tackle and to eliminate fuel poverty? Given the Chancellor's specific interests in the problems of child poverty, will he ensure that dealing with fuel poverty is a priority in the forthcoming Budget?	2003-12-18.1706.0	person/10541	person/10268	True	2003-12-18	blair	False	False	0	Treasury	Treasury	Energy Efficiency	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

He is right to highlight the role of electricity generation in meeting our climate change targets but that is not the only area involved. The pre-Budget report and the track record of this Government since 1997 demonstrate that we will take decisions for the long term and put in place programmes of support that will help the UK to make a contribution to tackling the threat of global warming.	2003-12-18.1706.3	The Minister will be aware that a key to sustainable and efficient energy is the renewables obligation. However, is he aware that, beyond that obligation, not a single new generating project is being developed owing to a complete lack of long-term finance?

2003-12-18.5.0	I congratulate my hon Friend on all the work that he does on these issues in his constituency. I agree entirely, and I hope that Opposition Members will, even at this late stage, join the Government in an all-party crusade to eradicate poverty from society, particularly among children, instead of simply complaining about the fact that people live in poverty. It is difficult, however, to see how their commitment to cuts of £80 billion would help to achieve that.	2003-12-18.1707.1	I am sure that my right hon Friend will agree that, if a Labour Government are for anything, they are for the fight against poverty, particularly child poverty. Given that the Joseph Rowntree Foundation announced only this month that the latest figures have passed the notable milestone of taking income poverty lower than at any time in the 1990s, does she agree that the Government's aspiration to abolish child poverty altogether should be founded not only on one party's policies but on bipartisan consensus?	2003-12-18.1707.0	person/10941	person/10489	True	2003-12-18	blair	False	False	0	Treasury	Treasury	Child Poverty	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2003-12-18.5.1	I regret the tone of the hon Gentleman's question, which is typical of the kind of carping that goes on, rather than joining in the celebrations. As he well knows, all the elements of the child tax credit were announced on pre-Budget day, as is always the case. He is trying to make it sound as though the House was misled, but perhaps I should remind him that for the first time millions of families are receiving the payment, which he and his party have yet to confirm that they would honour.	2003-12-18.1707.3	The extra money for tackling child poverty announced by the Chancellor in the pre-Budget report is certainly welcome. Can the Minister explain, however, why the Chancellor did not have the honesty to explain in his statement that the child poverty measures were being funded by freezing other tax credits?	2003-12-18.1707.2	person/11036	person/10489	False	2003-12-18	blair	False	False	0	Treasury	Treasury	Child Poverty	0	liberal-democrat	False	False	labour	True	False

My hon Friend will also know that the Government's commitment on children's centres is a commitment to roll out and to continue that programme. To take a much wider perspective, I am sure that he would acknowledge that in tackling poverty—particularly child poverty—the Government need to concentrate not only on the income of such families but on the full range of public services that are delivered to them."	2003-12-18.1708.0	Does my right hon Friend agree that, although we have made remarkable progress and invested so much in early years and the eradication of child poverty, it is still true that the Sure Start programme is one of the most effective that we have introduced? However, a lot of children in poor homes do not live in the 20 per cent. of wards that are the most deprived, so can she think of any way in which we can get to those poor children more quickly?	2003-12-18.1707.4	person/10534	person/10489	False	2003-12-18	blair	False	False	0	Treasury	Treasury	Child Poverty	0	labourco-operative	False	False	labour	True	False
2003-12-18.5.3	It is an excellent question, Mr. Speaker. I congratulate my hon Friend because I know that he has done a huge amount of work in his constituency on that matter. He highlights the commitment to the child trust fund as one of many measures that the Government are taking. It is an asset of £500 for a child over their life. It encourages the savings habit and is an example of progressive universalism. I return to the point made by my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Harris) . We need all-party support and determination to tackle and to eradicate child poverty—support and determination that unfortunately are seriously lacking in both Opposition parties.	2003-12-18.1708.5	The Chancellor has said lots of times that one of the best ways to tackle child poverty is to get unemployment down. Obviously, progress is being made, but can it continue? Has the Minister had a chance to examine the recent CBI report on Britain as a place to do business? It reveals that 60 per cent. of senior managers surveyed believe that the Government are not taking seriously their concerns about red tape and regulation, and 40 per cent. said that they were thinking of offshoring—	2003-12-18.1708.1	person/10726	person/10489	False	2003-12-18	blair	False	False	0	Treasury	Treasury	Child Poverty	3	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2003-12-18.6.0	I am happy to give my hon Friend that assurance.

I am pleased to hear his confirmation that the NHS will continue to receive the Government money it needs.

That is their record: this is ours.	2003-12-18.1709.4	The Chief Secretary congratulates the Government on raising NHS spending by £35 billion a year until 2008, but does he accept that the people of this country expect to get value for such vast amounts of money?	2003-12-18.1709.3	person/10355	person/10052	False	2003-12-18	blair	False	False	2	Treasury	Treasury	Nhs Expenditure	1	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False

Why does not he give them and—yes, it is Christmas—us some credit for that achievement?	2003-12-18.1710.1	I am sorry that the Chief Secretary is unable to explain the official figures.

Given half a chance, the Conservatives would ruin it with charges, cuts and unfair, inequitable subsidies for private health insurance.	2003-12-18.1710.3	I can tell my right hon Friend what increased investment has already delivered to the NHS at Warwick hospital. There are 150 more nurses, 20 more consultants, and a 40 per cent. increase in activity levels. We want to go further and get booked appointments and even shorter waiting times. Will the additional investment be forthcoming to deliver that?	2003-12-18.1710.2	person/10480	person/10052	False	2003-12-18	blair	False	False	0	Treasury	Treasury	Nhs Expenditure	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2003-12-18.6.5	No, I do not. This has nothing whatever to do with ideology, but everything to do with how best to help people and how best to deliver an NHS that is fair and free at the point of use. We need to stand back for a moment and reflect on what health care would be like if we were to provide the subsidy for people with private medical insurance that some Opposition Members propose—including, I suspect, the hon Gentleman. The Opposition's patient passport would increase deadweight costs by up to £1 billion. That would be the price the taxpayer would have to pay for something that was enjoyed only by the very richest in our society. That simply is not fair.	2003-12-18.1710.5	The Chief Secretary will be glad to know that I shall not raise an old canard, but I may have a new canard in mind. I appreciate what he has to say about public funding for the health service, but equally he will appreciate that there need to be financial incentives for private health care. Does he believe that that is ideologically wrong, even if financial incentives for private health care ensure that there is a bigger pot for health care on which all our citizens can rely?	2003-12-18.1710.4	person/10884	person/10052	False	2003-12-18	blair	False	False	0	Treasury	Treasury	Nhs Expenditure	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False

The gap is closing extremely slowly, however. Will my right hon Friend look again at the formula that delivers extra expenditure to deprived communities like mine, and try to close the gap a little more rapidly?	2003-12-18.1711.0	person/10304	person/10052	False	2003-12-18	blair	False	False	0	Treasury	Treasury	Nhs Expenditure	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

It is a definition that has ensured that we are now involved in providing 860,000 more elective admissions each year. It is a definition that has worked for this country, and for the NHS.	2003-12-18.1711.3	Will the right hon Gentleman put on record the Treasury definition of public expenditure, and also the Treasury definition of public sector investment, so that next time the Prime Minister is asked that question—as he was yesterday—he does not through ignorance lamentably and inadvertently mislead the House?	2003-12-18.1711.2	person/11291	person/10052	False	2003-12-18	blair	False	False	0	Treasury	Treasury	Nhs Expenditure	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False

2003-12-18.7.1	I assure my hon Friend that we are well aware of the impact of health inequalities. That is why the Government introduced a fairer funding formula for the NHS in 2002.

That shows that the Government recognise the particular pressures on local authorities in terms of the environment and social services for children. That money is on top of the extra £420 million announced in the provisional statement in November. We should make the comparison with previous years. By next year, local authorities will have received a real-terms increase of some 30 per cent. since 1997, as against a fall of 7 per cent. in the last years of the previous Government.
I note that the hon Gentleman's party is not suggesting that it would vary expenditure levels from the Government's current position, so perhaps he would like to tell us what the magic answer is that the Government's proposals do not provide."	2003-12-18.1712.5	The Minister will know that in Cornwall, and in the south-west generally, many households fall into that category while others are just above that level, and do not benefit from the council tax benefit concessions.

As the Government made clear as recently as last week in the pre-Budget statement, we stand ready to play our part; the question now is whether local authorities will continue to play theirs.	2003-12-18.1712.7	Given the effect of the council tax on low-income families, does my right hon Friend agree that it is unsurprising to find that council taxes in Labour areas are, on average, the lowest, while those in Conservative areas are the highest, and those in Liberal Democrat areas are the second highest?	2003-12-18.1712.6	person/10220	person/10489	False	2003-12-18	blair	False	False	0	Treasury	Treasury	Council Tax	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2003-12-18.8.2	The Prime Minister has made it clear that we do not favour that particular proposal, but for such any such proposal to be taken seriously, the Liberal Democrats would need to move beyond generalisations and tell us exactly how it would be achieved, how much it would cost and what extra bureaucracy would be entailed, particularly in respect of employers, who currently collect pay-as-you-earn. How would they deal with such a highly complex system, and how much would it cost them?	2003-12-18.1713.1	Does the right hon Lady accept that the last question was somewhat loaded, and will she also assure the House that however much the Liberal Democrats might rabbit on about local income tax, this Government will never introduce it?	2003-12-18.1713.0	person/10134	person/10489	False	2003-12-18	blair	False	False	0	Treasury	Treasury	Council Tax	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False

As always, the Liberal Democrats provide no detail and simply make win, win generalisations. Even superficial scrutiny of these proposals would reveal the problems of local disparities, the complexity of the system and the burdens on employers. As a result, the security of finance to local authorities could be seriously undermined.	2003-12-18.1713.3	Does my right hon Friend agree that replacing the council tax with local income tax would entrench regional disparities, and result in the poorest people in the poorest regions bearing a far greater proportion of the cost?	2003-12-18.1713.2	person/10377	person/10489	False	2003-12-18	blair	False	False	0	Treasury	Treasury	Council Tax	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2003-12-18.8.4	I welcome the hon Gentleman to the Dispatch Box—this is the first time he has asked a question in Treasury orals. If he cares to look at the tax and benefit reform undertaken by this Government and opposed by his party, he will see, for example, the massive increases in respect of families with children in the poorest fifth of the population. On average, they will be £2,900 a year better off by September 2004. The poorest one third of pensioner households have gained £1,600 a year in real terms. We have given £3.6 billion extra in resources and, as the hon Gentleman well knows, the targeting of those resources at the very poorest in our community is the Government's priority, but his party has failed to commit itself to that strategy.	2003-12-18.1713.5	A moment ago, the Paymaster General referred to the £340 million that has been given to help contain the massive council tax rises resulting from Labour's burdening of local authorities with huge demands to supply more services. Is she aware that, either through incompetence—as I suspect—or design, the distribution formula means that each council tax payer in East Sussex and West Sussex will receive precisely tuppence of that £340 million? Does she not realise that those who are worst hit by these policies are poor people and pensioners in constituencies such as mine? How can she possibly justify a figure of tuppence a head?	2003-12-18.1713.4	person/10613	person/10489	False	2003-12-18	blair	False	False	0	Treasury	Treasury	Council Tax	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2003-12-18.9.0	My hon Friend is something of an expert on the subject; he serves with distinguished commitment on the Environmental Audit Committee. He is right that aviation is responsible for about 10 per cent. of the UK climate change problem, but the projections that I think he has in mind overstate the potential problem, and fail to take into account a couple of important points, as he may recognise. First, the projections assume no improvements in technology, although over the past 30 years there has been a 50 per cent. cut in fuel consumption. Secondly, they assume that no new measures will be put in place. My hon Friend will know, because his Committee has studied the matter, that with the publication of this week's air transport White Paper, it is clear that we are putting in place what I hope he will acknowledge to be bold and decisive measures to deal with emissions that contribute to climate change, noise levels that affect local residents, and local air pollution. The air transport White Paper makes it clear that the additional capacity that we need in this country will be balanced by broad-ranging environmental measures to tackle the environmental consequences of aviation, which we need, too.	2003-12-18.1714.4	I thank my hon Friend for that answer, because it shows that a bold and decisive policy gets bold and decisive results. Will he assure me that the hard won gains in reduced carbon emissions will not be sacrificed owing to the exponential growth in aviation, and that the Government will take a similarly bold and decisive policy approach to reducing emissions from aircraft?	2003-12-18.1714.3	person/10790	person/10268	True	2003-12-18	blair	False	False	0	Treasury	Treasury	Climate Change Levy	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2003-12-18.9.1	I can indeed confirm that. My hon Friend follows these issues closely, so he will know that the climate change agreements that we put in place, which give the heavy energy-using sectors that he has in mind a discount of up to 80 per cent., have delivered three times the anticipated savings in carbon dioxide emissions. He will have noticed that last week my right hon Friend the Chancellor confirmed that we are prepared to extend the eligibility for those negotiated agreements to equally intensive energy-using sectors that face international competition. I am sure that my hon Friend will welcome that move, as will many parts of industry.	2003-12-18.1714.6	Does my hon Friend recognise that although the policy has obviously achieved the environmental impact that he mentioned, the Government changed it considerably to meet the requirements of heavy energy users from the industrial sector? Will he confirm that discussions on that subject are ongoing, because as well as wanting environmental benefits, the Government recognise the importance of ensuring that our manufacturing jobs are secure, and that we keep those jobs?	2003-12-18.1714.5	person/10479	person/10268	False	2003-12-18	blair	False	False	0	Treasury	Treasury	Climate Change Levy	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2003-12-18.10.0	The local transport capital expenditure for Yorkshire and Humberside was £180 million, and it is £106 million in 2003–04. That compares with just £70 million in 1999. That doubling of expenditure could not take place under a 35 per cent. of GDP quota. Nurses, doctors and teachers, as well as the road and rail programmes, would be affected by such a massive cut.	2003-12-18.1715.4	I thank my right hon Friend for that answer. Does he agree that one of the main challenges in Yorkshire is the lack of investment in our transport infrastructure? If those policies were followed, what assessment would he make of our chances of clawing back the 30 years and more of under-investment in transport infrastructure in my region?	2003-12-18.1715.3	person/10494	person/10068	True	2003-12-18	blair	False	False	0	Treasury	Treasury	Public Spending	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

Just as they were wrong on the new deal, the Bank of England and the minimum wage, they were wrong in the way they privatised the railways.	2003-12-18.1715.6	How can the Chancellor square the record increase in investment in Network Rail with the fact that performance will not reach the levels enjoyed on the railways in 1997 for a considerable time to come?

She is also wrong to say that without a change in Europe we can introduce a reduced rate for energy-efficient products such as fridges, boilers and light bulbs. We continue to battle with our friends in other member states in Europe to try to win the argument and we will consider the much narrower areas where we have the scope within the European system to introduce reduced rates that could help to achieve greater energy efficiency in the UK.	2003-12-18.1716.6	I thank the Minister for his answer and for the response he gave earlier to the hon Member for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson) . Will the Minister continue to examine closely the issue of reducing VAT on energy-saving materials and admit that the Government were wrong to suggest that Europe was stopping them reducing VAT to 5 per cent.? Will he make an announcement as soon as possible so that people can put plans in place to reduce the scourge of fuel poverty in this day and age?	2003-12-18.1716.5	person/10863	person/10268	True	2003-12-18	blair	False	False	0	Treasury	Treasury	Home Energy Efficiency	0	liberal-democrat	False	False	labour	True	False
2003-12-18.11.1	In many ways I understand the point that my hon Friend makes about impatience and frustration in the industry, but I hope that he will see the pre-Budget report as encouraging. It confirms that we see the case for using economic instruments to promote energy efficiency in the home and that we are considering a range of possible fiscal measures, including the capital allowances in which my hon Friend is so interested. The work is complicated by the European review of reduced VAT rates and by a review that we have to undertake of the operation of corporation tax. Without a clearer idea of the outcome of both, it is difficult to make hard decisions. Nevertheless, we do not want to delay such decisions or announcements any longer than we need too.	2003-12-18.1717.1	I thank my hon Friend for his earlier responses and I congratulate the Government on the swift announcement today of their combined heat and power targets for the whole of the Government estate, as required by the Sustainable Energy Act 2003. I wish to draw his attention to the frustration in the industry at the fact that the barriers that the Treasury consultation document so rightly identified could be addressed more quickly if the issue of capital allowances were tackled. I urge him to do that when the Government present their energy efficiency plan in February.	2003-12-18.1717.0	person/10629	person/10268	True	2003-12-18	blair	False	False	0	Treasury	Treasury	Home Energy Efficiency	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

Clearly, those calculations and that analysis will be part of any decisions that the Government take and the Chancellor announces as part of the Budget next year and beyond.	2003-12-18.1717.3	While I appreciate that in the area of energy efficiency VAT rating is a matter of EU directive interpretation and the decision of the Chancellor in his next Budget statement, will the Minister undertake a cost-benefit analysis well ahead of the Budget, which would indicate the loss to the Revenue on one side, if a selected group of energy efficiency materials had a lower rate of VAT—in particular, thermal insulation materials—against, on the other side, the benefits from improving energy efficiency in households? That would be helpful for the Government and the House in interpreting whatever measures the Chancellor announces in his next Budget.	2003-12-18.1717.2	person/10099	person/10268	False	2003-12-18	blair	False	False	0	Treasury	Treasury	Home Energy Efficiency	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False

We have proposed for countries that are coming out of conflict a far speedier process of debt relief so that, as they restructure their country, they can also restructure their economy free from the burden of debt. I hope that he and others will support us in what we are doing.	2003-12-18.1718.1	I thank my right hon Friend for that response. At the conference, will he use his good offices to impress on South Africa, India and China the need to make sure that all those extremely poor parts of the world that are war-riven are brought back to the table of peace, to make sure that there is the right context for the millennium goals to be achieved more quickly?	2003-12-18.1718.0	person/10246	person/10068	True	2003-12-18	blair	False	False	0	Treasury	Treasury	Millennium Development Goals	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

Some of the countries mentioned by my hon Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) could get debt relief if they were out of conflict. We continue to look at how we can persuade other countries to come up with more funds. My hon Friend is right that the WTO talks are important to this and that public opinion matters in this. It is 20 years this Christmas since Bob Geldof's Band Aid raised public awareness of the problems of poverty in Africa. All parties and all good-minded people could combine and public opinion could be alerted to the blatant need to take further action to deal with world poverty.	2003-12-18.1718.3	Nobody doubts the Chancellor's commitment to ensuring that the millennium development goals are met, but I am sure that he is aware that we are falling well short of the targets that we set ourselves on the way. Does he agree that they could be speeded up in two ways: by the World Trade Organisation talks getting back on track and, specifically—I speak as a member of the all-party group on heavily indebted poorest countries—by him looking again at the debt levels and sustainability of the HIPC initiative for a number of those countries, particularly in Africa, in the light of the reduction in the price of consumer products such as coffee?	2003-12-18.1718.2	person/10500	person/10068	False	2003-12-18	blair	False	False	0	Treasury	Treasury	Millennium Development Goals	1	labourco-operative	False	False	labour	True	False

However, many of those young people will, like my hon Friend's constituents, participate in the new deal, and I agree with him that it is certainly one of the best investments of taxpayers' money that one could wish for.	2004-12-13a.1373.7	I thank my right hon Friend for those statistics. Will she also bear in mind the fact that, behind the statistics, there are people such as Clare Robertson, my constituent from Bulwell, who had no hope of getting the kind of job in administration that she wanted? She was given training through the gateway programme, and given advice by the job adviser. She was also given a subsidy to ensure that a local employer took her on to do the job that she wanted. I understand that, today, Clare has a full-time job as a result of all that. This is surely the best investment that we can make in our individuals.

2004-12-13.0.1	That is a very thoughtful question. The hon Gentleman is right to say that the Rowntree Foundation's report pointed that out. However, it also complimented the work that we have done to tackle poverty. I accept that youth unemployment remains too high, and that we have more to do in that regard. That is why there was a range of measures in the pre-Budget report last week, including a concentration on skills, so that more young people who are in unwaged full-time training can pick up financial assistance in the same way as others get the education maintenance allowance.	2004-12-13a.1374.0	Whereas it is true that the number of young people on jobseeker's allowance in Nottingham, North has fallen, they now represent a bigger proportion than they did in 1997. Then, 26 per cent. were on jobseeker's allowance; now, the figure is 34 per cent. Does the Minister accept that more could still be done to support young people in getting into the labour market? Will she also look at the lessons that could be derived from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation's report, which identified four wards in Nottingham as still being subjected to great poverty?

Obviously, we need much more information, but let me make this absolutely clear once again: we have not said that we will be able to match the assistance—the compensation available—in the pension protection fund, nor do we accept any liability for what has happened in the past.
We have said that we should be able to provide some assistance, particularly to those people who have lost the most and are in the worst position in terms of being closer to retirement and who cannot make up that money because of that proximity. So we have made it absolutely clear that we do not in any way pledge to meet every single amount lost from these schemes.

2004-12-13.1.2	"Well, I have heard a few good jokes over the Christmas period, but I have not heard that one before. It is a real cracker—our pension protection fund is responsible for Federal-Mogul's problems with Turner and Newell. I do not accept that at all, although Conservative Members may be more gullible than we are on these Benches.
The situation with Federal-Mogul is very serious. That company is not in insolvency and we expect that it can meet its commitments. Indeed, negotiations are going on now. We think that the amount in the FAS will give proper compensation. I question the assertion made by the hon Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) that, somehow, the Opposition could do better than this, because from what I see—£35 billion spending cuts and, I presume, 100,000 staff to go from the Department for Work and Pensions—I doubt whether they would have the money even to administer the FAS, let alone—"	2004-12-13a.1375.2	Has the Secretary of State seen that the US parent company blames his pension legislation for the most unfortunate breakdown of negotiations over the Turner and Newell pension scheme? Does he accept the view of industry experts that that very collapse could swamp both the FAS and the PPF? Is it not high time that he admitted what everyone else already knows—that the FAS is not remotely adequate for the task it faces?	2004-12-13a.1375.1	person/10624	person/10314	False	2004-12-13	blair	False	False	0	Work And Pensions	Work And Pensions	Pensions	1	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2004-12-13.1.3	"The hon Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb) has put on a bit of weight since we last saw him—it is pleasant to have the hon Member for Chesterfield (Paul Holmes) stepping in. I do not accept the hon Gentleman's point that this is a cruel deception. Most people thought it extraordinary that a Government would provide such assistance in retrospect. Certainly in view of the experience under previous Governments, no matter what we are considering, it is very rare for such a thing to happen and it is very unlikely that it would have happened under the previous Government. We think that the money available is sufficient. We have also said right from the start that we would welcome a financial contribution from the industry. It is fair to say that we have not been swamped with money, but we live in hope.
There is also the money that is still in some of those schemes and the deemed buy-back arrangements that could add extra money to it, but £400 million is a significant contribution for the Government to make, giving some financial assistance with the real problems that the hon Gentleman raises on behalf of his constituents."	2004-12-13a.1376.0	Those facing financial devastation as a result of losing their occupational pensions through no fault of their own include constituents of mine who work for Chesterfield Cylinders, Dema Glass and Coalite. They soon saw that the £400 million in the FAS was a cruel con trick; it was far too little to provide the compensation needed. Ministers seem to accept this, because they have said that they hope that industry will make up the shortfall. If, as it appears from the Secretary of State's earlier answer, industry has not provided any money to make up the shortfall, are the Government prepared to see these people face a bleak old age, or will they make up the difference?	2004-12-13a.1375.4	person/10968	person/10314	False	2004-12-13	blair	False	False	0	Work And Pensions	Work And Pensions	Pensions	0	liberal-democrat	False	False	labour	True	False
2004-12-13.1.4	I confirm that in the scenario that my hon Friend paints that would be the situation; it would qualify for the PPF. It is also relevant to point out that there would be a substantial amount of money anyway, to assist us with that situation. Also, the money paid out from the PPF—if it came to that, and let us hope it does not—would not be paid out for several years. So the PPF is adequately placed to meet any commitment, including one from Turner and Newell.	2004-12-13a.1376.2	I agree with my right hon Friend in dismissing the hypocritical and nonsensical remarks from the Opposition. In respect of Federal-Mogul, can he confirm if not today, then in the near future, that if indeed the Americans have resiled and remain in the position of repudiating the undertakings they gave to Members of all parties in the House some weeks ago, and that if the pension fund were to go into wind-up—a second order would be necessary to dispose of the assets, which could not come into operation until April next year—that pension fund would then benefit from the PPF arrangements and that, largely, the commitments could be met in that way?	2004-12-13a.1376.1	person/10506	person/10314	False	2004-12-13	blair	False	False	0	Work And Pensions	Work And Pensions	Pensions	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2004-12-13.1.5	The hon Gentleman and I have clashed on various occasions, but in a good-natured way. I cannot understand a question that seems to place the onus in these negotiations on those on the Government Front Bench, the Opposition Front Bench or any other person in the House. The responsibility for the situation in relation to Turner and Newell and Federal-Mogul, which is of huge concern to his constituents and those of others around the House, is a matter for the company, its trade unions and its shareholders. It is up to them to find a solution to the problem, and I very much hope that he will join me in urging them to redouble their efforts to do so.	2004-12-13a.1377.0	The Secretary of State said a few moments ago that he lived in hope. My constituents live in England, and they want to know what has happened over the past few weeks to the Turner and Newell pension fund, which they thought was sorted out, but which they now find has a great question mark hanging over it? Never mind living in hope—what hope is there for them?	2004-12-13a.1376.3	person/10397	person/10314	False	2004-12-13	blair	False	False	0	Work And Pensions	Work And Pensions	Pensions	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2004-12-13.1.6	I agree with my right hon Friend that we should always be careful about talking about Government money—of course it is taxpayers' money. I also agree with him completely that his constituents and mine think it a very generous settlement. In terms of what we do with so-called orphan funds, we want to reunite those unclaimed assets with their rightful owners. It is a mistake to base policy on a financial assistance scheme of taking money when we do not know how much is there—I have heard estimates varying from £170,000 to billions of pounds—or on seeking to take money from accounts over which we have no control and which are owned by other people. The £400 million settlement, which is generous, as he recognises, gives far more confidence to the people affected than the suggestion that we can somehow match that from orphan funds.	2004-12-13a.1377.2	The Secretary of State keeps talking about the Government having put up £400 million. May I remind him that it is my constituents who are putting up that money, and they think that it is a very generous settlement? But as they and practically everyone else in the House do not believe that the £400 million will be adequate, who in the Government is blocking the suggestion, which is supported on both sides of the House, that the Government use some of the unclaimed assets to meet the bill, so that people have their pensions met in full?	2004-12-13a.1377.1	person/10197	person/10314	False	2004-12-13	blair	False	False	0	Work And Pensions	Work And Pensions	Pensions	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

It is an important early-day motion, as it matches what we would like, which is a contribution from the industry. We live in hope, as the hon Member for West Derbyshire (Mr. McLoughlin) reminded me, and now that the FAS is on the statute book, and as we get closer to finalisation, I still hope that we will see contributions coming from that quarter.	2004-12-13a.1377.4	Has my right hon Friend had the chance to study my early-day motion 359, which calls on the pension industry to make a contribution?

2004-12-13.2.0	I thank my hon Friend for that question. He will be aware that by Christmas, 18,000 of his constituents will have received the winter fuel payment of up to £300, and 3,000 will receive the additional payments of up to £400. That will make a major contribution to ensuring that no pensioner in Hartlepool must choose between keeping warm and other items of expenditure. Our fuel poverty strategy, which we have recently republished as an action programme, is making sure not only that we deal with the issue of poverty, through winter fuel payments and pension credit, but that we put an emphasis through Warm Front on energy efficiency and working with energy suppliers to ensure that no vulnerable households find themselves unable to meet their fuel costs.	2004-12-13a.1378.4	I welcome the Minister's comments, which have taken away my voice. That halving is astonishing and welcome. The evidence reinforces the belief of many that this Government have done more than any other for the poorest pensioners in the country. But will he agree that fuel poverty is still not zero; and what steps has he taken to ensure that that figure is achieved by 2010, and preferably before?	2004-12-13a.1378.3	person/11362	person/10482	True	2004-12-13	blair	False	False	0	Work And Pensions	Work And Pensions	Fuel Poverty	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2004-12-13.2.1	Our fuel action plan was based on the expected increase in utility prices in the near future, but we will keep it under review to minimise the impact of any further increases on vulnerable households, through energy efficiency programmes and whatever other measures are necessary for us to stay on track for our target of eliminating fuel poverty by 2010, as far as is practicable. As for my hon Friend's windfall tax proposal, we will take it as one of the earliest representations for the Budget.	2004-12-13a.1378.6	The Government have indeed done a good job on fuel poverty so far, but there are darks clouds on the horizon, given increasing utility prices. A 12 per cent. gas price increase, for example, is likely to return half a million people to fuel poverty. Have the Government considered imposing a windfall tax on utility companies to protect the fuel poor at least until we persuade the Europeans to liberalise their energy markets?	2004-12-13a.1378.5	person/10304	person/10482	False	2004-12-13	blair	False	False	0	Work And Pensions	Work And Pensions	Fuel Poverty	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2004-12-13.3.0	"I will not be seduced, as a politician, into being political about this, but I do acknowledge that gender differences and assumptions about gender in the past—some have now been rectified for a younger group of women—have caused a big difference in terms of access to the full basic state pension. That is why we are not tempted to put all the extra resources into a link between earnings and the basic state pension, which would be good news for many men but not such good news for women.
One of the successes of pension credit is the high take-up of the guarantee. I am pleased to say that 320,000 more pensioners—by definition, the poorest—receive the guarantee element than did so in April 2003. Whereas under the Conservatives the guarantee level was a miserly £69 a week for a single person, from next April it will be £109 a week. That is the difference—not just words, but £40 a week—between what the Conservatives did and what a Labour Government are delivering."	2004-12-13a.1379.6	Does my hon Friend acknowledge that if the basic state pension were the prime source of income for women in retirement, that would be disastrous for them? More than 85 per cent. of women gain little from it, if anything, and more than 60 per cent. have no entitlement to an income from it. Will my hon Friend acknowledge that such an arrangement would be a disaster, and in so doing acknowledge that the Conservative party's policy is an absolute nonsense?	2004-12-13a.1379.4	person/10585	person/10633	True	2004-12-13	blair	False	False	0	Work And Pensions	Work And Pensions	Female Pensioners	1	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2004-12-13.3.1	I thank my hon Friend for inviting me to visit Tameside. I was very impressed to see what a progressive local authority can do to deliver benefit entitlements to people in need. As my hon Friend knows, we developed joint teams as part of our link-age project. Social services departments worked with local branches of the Pension Service, joined in some areas by primary care trusts or voluntary bodies such as Age Concern. That is how we deliver a welfare state locally, based on the needs of elderly people. In the past we have tended to expect elderly people to discover an often complex local welfare state, but Tameside is showing the way ahead. We intend to roll out its scheme throughout the country during the next year or two.	2004-12-13a.1380.0	I thank my hon Friend for visiting my constituency recently to see the efforts made by Tameside to raise the level of take-up of the guarantee.

Two groups that overlap—the older elderly, often over-80, and women—are benefiting from that selective approach to delivering social policy. I am sure that, in a more moderate moment, she would want to welcome that.	2004-12-13a.1380.2	The Minister will be aware that less than half of women pensioners in Scotland are entitled to the full basic state pension and that, after seven years of Labour Government, one in five pensioners in Scotland still lives in poverty.

We are in favour in the Department of a flexible labour market.
As I say, there is a rich debate going on about the future state pension. I seriously welcome the hon Gentleman's contribution to that debate, but we need to be careful about different cohorts and groups. What is right for the elderly person, often the elderly lady over 80, will not necessarily be right for her daughter, let alone her grand-daughter. More workers today, including young workers, are members of occupational pension schemes. We welcome today's publication of the report by the Employer Task Force on Pensions. We need to have a combination of occupational pensions, others savings and state pensions, so that today's young will have incomes in retirement above means-tested levels."	2004-12-13a.1380.6	May I draw the Minister of State's attention to the proposals that we have made today for giving women a better deal from the contributory state pension?

2004-12-13.4.0	I acknowledge that some pensioners who are entitled to the credit have not yet taken it up, but we are doing a lot of work to try to improve the situation. I do not agree that it is necessarily the poorest pensioners who have not taken it up; in many instances, it is those who would receive only a small extra amount and have judged that it is not worth their while to claim it. We are none the less redoubling our efforts in the Department to re-contact people we think most likely to be entitled who have not applied, and our local service is working in all communities to try to improve take-up. In my hon Friend's constituency there were 235 home visits in October, and since April there have been 1,482 home visits in south-west Wales.

Does my hon Friend agree that the 154,000 households in Wales, including the 3,000 in Monmouth, will find pension credit an incredibly valuable resource, but does she acknowledge that perhaps a third of the poorest pensioners who may be entitled to the credit do not get it?

2004-12-13.5.0	"The answer to both questions is no. The hon Gentleman should refrain from believing everything he reads in the press. First, the number of people coming on to incapacity benefits has fallen by a third; had it continued on the same trend as under the Conservative Government it would now be more than 4 million rather than 2.7 million. Secondly, on this so-called explosion in the number claiming on mental health grounds, there were 210,000 in 1997, and there are now 230,000—hardly an explosion. The same press report, which talked about 500,000 men who may have swapped their income because it was so profitable to go on to incapacity benefit—that is, 3,500 a year—came from a Bank of England survey, which clearly stated that it was about what happened in the late 80s and early 90s in the context of massive economic decline. It said:
""it seems unlikely that this 1990s' experience will be repeated""."	2004-12-13a.1383.1	I thank the Secretary of State for that comprehensive reply, but am I not right in believing that since 1997 there has been a 53 per cent. increase in the number of people claiming incapacity benefit on grounds of mental health or behavioural difficulties, which is nearly two out of every five claimants? Is not the truth that this rise is absolutely out of control?	2004-12-13a.1383.0	person/11199	person/10314	True	2004-12-13	blair	False	False	0	Work And Pensions	Work And Pensions	Incapacity Benefit	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2004-12-13.5.1	I have not heard that particular criticism before, but I am willing to look at any cases that my hon Friend might want to raise with us. The personal capability assessment is one of the most stringent gateways to incapacity benefit in the world, as judged by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Indeed, in terms of the medical profession's work, the problem lies not with the PCA but at the turnstile, as it were, in that the sick-note culture is putting many people off working when it would be better for their health to stay at work. My right hon Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced an extension of the existing trials to enable rehabilitation and to allow Employment Service people to get involved in GPs' surgeries, in order to ensure that people do not go down the incapacity benefit route. We should bear it in mind that the record shows that those who are on incapacity benefit for a year will remain on it for eight years, and that those who are on it for two years will die on it.	2004-12-13a.1383.3	What is the Secretary of State going to do to improve the standard of medical examination?

[Interruption.] The hon Gentleman shakes his head but they are the statistics. Of course, we want to go much further, but I should make the rather obvious point that we are still dealing with the problems arising from the Conservative Government's policy of transferring people from unemployment benefit to incapacity benefit; indeed, my hon Friends still have to deal with such problems day in, day out in their constituencies. That policy left us with 2.6 million people on incapacity benefit when we took office.
The hon Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman) is of course right to say that this issue needs to be tackled, and it is being tackled effectively for the first time through pathways to work, which is enabling the Government to give a helping hand to those who really want to re-engage with society, but who did not have the necessary help and financial support in the past."	2004-12-13a.1383.5	The figures quoted by my hon Friend the Member for Romford (Mr. Rosindell) were official figures, not press figures, and according to them incapacity benefit claims made on mental health and behavioural grounds now number more than 1 million for the first time.

On the abolition of payable tax credits, the hon Gentleman is making a very partisan point. It was an essential part of a package of corporation tax reforms that included both the main and small companies.

There are certainly some major tax incentives in the system to encourage people to invest in occupational schemes. Our priority is to ensure that the many millions of people who are not in decent work or occupational pensions have the opportunity of being so, and we would like it to be on a voluntary basis. The Employer Task Force on Pensions has made some interesting recommendations, but whether or not compulsion is necessary is a matter that we have asked the Turner commission to review for us. We will look at its recommendations and make a judgment in due course.	2004-12-13a.1385.4	May I suggest to my hon Friend that the way to increase private pension provision is to continue doing what the Government have been doing, which is to bolster confidence in the private pension system? Given that £14 billion a year goes on tax relief and that Department for Work and Pensions research shows that it has no effect on bolstering those pensions, I seek my hon Friend's reassurance that tax relief for private pensions will not be increased and that the Government will continue to bolster confidence and to bolster the state system.	2004-12-13a.1385.3	person/11095	person/10633	False	2004-12-13	blair	False	False	0	Work And Pensions	Work And Pensions	Private Pensions	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

My hon Friend's question reminds us that what we are doing in respect of employment policy and our success in moving back towards full employment will have a crucial impact on pensions for women as well as men. The impact of giving women the opportunity to have successful careers and of providing help with child care shows that those policies are as much pension policies as the formal pension policies that we tend to discuss at Question Time.	2004-12-13a.1386.1	I thank my hon Friend for that reply.

That is why we have given new rights to part-time members of the work force to be members of occupational pension schemes, which is a great step forward. As I said earlier, I am not complacent about these matters. We will consider the TUC report—I spoke at its conference—and we hope to move forward in the future.	2004-12-13a.1386.3	What assessment has the Minister made of the recent TUC report, particularly on the implications for women who work part time and earn substantially less—22 per cent. less—than men? About 15 per cent. of the unskilled workers among the women work force are not part of an occupational pension scheme. What are the Government going to do for them?	2004-12-13a.1386.2	person/10389	person/10633	False	2004-12-13	blair	False	False	0	Work And Pensions	Work And Pensions	State Second Pension	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2004-12-13.7.2	We need to recognise that much of the useful work or activity in society takes place outside the formal labour market. The history of pension policy since the second world war is Governments—I must point out that that means Labour Governments—recognising that caring for children is important and should be credited into a basic state pension. This Labour Government have recognised that the balance of care is almost shifting towards caring for elderly relatives and that is why we are crediting that into the new state second pension. Progress has been made, and that will show up in the average basic state pensions that people retire on in the middle decades of this century. However, we need to do more.	2004-12-13a.1387.0	Does my hon Friend agree with the Pensions Policy Institute, which has said that that the average woman will lose out under the Conservatives' proposed policy? Can he comment on what the effect on women pensioners would be of the Tory party's plans to abolish the second state pension?	2004-12-13a.1386.4	person/10378	person/10633	False	2004-12-13	blair	False	False	0	Work And Pensions	Work And Pensions	State Second Pension	2	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2004-12-13.8.0	I am not sure whether the hon Gentleman was able to join us last week for the interesting debate on that issue on estimates day, opened by the hon Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Sir Archy Kirkwood) . First, there is no legal liability. The two systems are in separate legislation, so there is no legal redress against the Government for not being transferred from system 1 to system 2. Secondly, system 1 has advantages, as I pointed out in the debate. If the parent with care—usually a woman—gets a job, she qualifies for £5 a week arrears, which is £1,000, as opposed to the £10 disregard under system 2. The hon Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) reminds me of a point that I did not pick up in that debate, which is the suggestion that somehow we want to sit around until the kids on the original system grow up—that might be something that we could recommend to some Opposition Members—and let the problem wither on the vine. That suggestion is beneath the Liberal Democrats—	2004-12-13a.1387.5	The Government's record in procuring, and suppliers such as EDS in supplying, major IT schemes is appalling, so we are all looking forward to the ID scheme system. I understand what the Secretary of State is saying about stocktaking before moving to a clear timetable for migration, but does he believe that his Department is in any way vulnerable to legal challenge by those who are put at a financial disadvantage compared with others in exactly the same circumstances who are on the new scheme? Does he propose to do anything about that inequity or is the game plan simply to wait for those children to grow up and the problem to solve itself?	2004-12-13a.1387.4	person/10269	person/10314	True	2004-12-13	blair	False	False	0	Work And Pensions	Work And Pensions	Child Support Agency	0	liberal-democrat	False	False	labour	True	False

I assure hon Members, especially the hon Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, who did not raise this issue but has a close interest in it, that nothing could be further from our thoughts. We want people to swap to CS2. It had the support of the whole House, not least because it is simpler and gives the £10 disregard, and we are determined to switch to it as quickly as possible, commensurate with avoiding the problems that we have faced previously. I am happy to give that assurance on record to the House.	2004-12-13a.1388.1	Nothing is beneath them.	2004-12-13a.1388.0	person/10544	person/10314	False	2004-12-13	blair	False	False	0	Work And Pensions	Work And Pensions	Child Support Agency	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2004-12-13.8.2	I think that my hon Friend is talking about the problem we experienced a couple of weeks ago when 80 per cent. of our desktop computers closed down. Although that did not affect benefit recipients, because the mainframe computers were unaffected, it affected our staff, who had to work really hard to ensure that more damage was not done. My hon Friend may be interested to know that EDS has told us that it was responsible for what happened a couple of weeks ago. The company has given us a report on how it happened and I have shared that with the Opposition. I record my thanks to our staff for ensuring that what could have made a much more profound difference to our customers did not, and that we actually recovered the situation.	2004-12-13a.1388.3	Nevertheless, does not my right hon Friend see a slight irony in the fact that, at a time when many DWP employees in my constituency are being forcibly removed from Crewe to Chester, adding an hour and a half to their working day, only the availability of civil servants who could continue the payment of benefits by writing everything out by hand saved my constituents from considerable inconvenience?	2004-12-13a.1388.2	person/10181	person/10314	False	2004-12-13	blair	False	False	0	Work And Pensions	Work And Pensions	Child Support Agency	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2004-12-13.8.3	"The hon Gentleman has been shadowing other Ministers, including me in a previous life; it is good to have Johnson and Boswell reunited once again across the Dispatch Box.
The hon Gentleman is absolutely right about previous statements. As we said in the debate last week, no Government are blameless on those IT failures. He would be the last person to suggest that the Government of whom he was a distinguished member—in the Department of Trade and Industry—did not run into similar problems. One has only to say the word ""Horizon"" to make them come over all pale and quivering. Previous Secretaries of State twice put off the introduction of CS2. It was due to be implemented in—I think—October 2001. It was put back by my right hon Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Central and put back again by my predecessor, my right hon Friend the Member for Oxford, East. As we said in the debate, there was not exactly a rush to get CS2 started; in fact, there were serious concerns. In the end, we were assured that the system would work well and properly, but it did not and we are still feeling the effects.
Finally, I did not say that we would go live in spring next year. In the debate last week, I said that spring 2005—April 2005, to be precise—is when the last piece of kit will be put in by EDS, which should rectify the horrendous problems that our staff have been facing with that particular system."	2004-12-13a.1389.0	"The Secretary of State will recall that for the past couple of years I have been away shadowing different portfolios. I left with the memory in my ears of his predecessors, the right hon Members for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling) and for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith), saying that there was no intention to move the CSA system until the thing was working properly, that it would be robust and that until it was robust it would not be introduced for new cases, let alone for existing ones. The House will have noticed that the present Secretary of State is saying exactly the same thing and giving a timetable of spring next year—I wonder why.
What will the Secretary of State say to the many thousands of cases—that means people—who are suffering because their assessments have been frozen in the present system? Are they not reasonable in concluding that this is all talk? They want a bit of action and accountability."	2004-12-13a.1388.4	person/10056	person/10314	False	2004-12-13	blair	False	False	0	Work And Pensions	Work And Pensions	Child Support Agency	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2004-12-13.9.0	As I have already said, the child rates in income support are also being increased above inflation. The living standards of lone parents and their children depend not only on the level of benefit or, indeed, tax credit but on our ability to help those parents into work. In deciding the increases in the different elements of both income support and tax credits we must find a way of maximising our ability to meet the target of halving, then eliminating, child poverty, and also helping lone parents and others into work. That is sometimes a difficult balance.	2004-12-13a.1389.5	The Government are committed to increasing the child element of child tax credit in line with earnings, but will not that be pulled down in future where lone parents are dependent on income support? The rate is below that of the retail prices index and is based on the Rossi index, which excludes housing, so by 2010 there may be problems.	2004-12-13a.1389.4	person/10026	person/10482	True	2004-12-13	blair	False	False	0	Work And Pensions	Work And Pensions	Lone Parent Benefits	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

However, he may be interested to hear about one lone parent who became involved in the new deal through her work-focused interview. She had previously worked in a factory but, after some discussion, she decided that she was not keen to go back to that employment. Lacking formal qualifications and self-confidence, she felt that there was very little that she could do but, after her experience on the new deal, she has now gained qualifications in literacy and numeracy that have enabled her to accept work as a receptionist.	2004-12-13a.1390.4	I thank my right hon Friend for her answer.

2004-12-13.11.0	"Despite what the hon Gentleman said, he got the number wrong and I got it right, which will be the theme of our little dialogue. If we put all our resources into raising the basic state pension in line with earnings, over time it would cost a considerable amount. In the immediate period—and I think that that is the policy of Her Majesty's loyal Opposition—it would be better news for men than for women, and for people on the full basic state pension. It would be poorer news for people on only a partial basic state pension, which is why we are focusing our attention on pension credit.
I do not quite understand what the hon Gentleman's policies are. I enjoy tramping through the New Forest, and often come across wild creatures, ponies and deer. I have never met him there, but no doubt I shall do so at some stage. Neither have I met all the 3,615—I repeat, 3,615—pensioner households in New Forest, West who receive pension credit. The hon Gentleman probably knows them all by name, but when he meets them does he tell them that they are victims of a terrible extension—"	2004-12-13a.1391.0	"I apologise, Mr. Speaker. I believe that I said ""Question no. 13"", but I meant to say ""Question no. 15"". Clearly, however, the answer was the same.
Does the Minister acknowledge that, notwithstanding the Government's efforts to improve take-up, 1.5 million people entitled to pension credit are still not receiving it? Would it not be better to allow the state pension to rise by linking it to the level of earnings, as the number of people requiring means-tested benefits would fall accordingly?"	2004-12-13a.1390.9	person/10580	person/10633	True	2004-12-13	blair	False	False	0	Work And Pensions	Work And Pensions	Means Testing	1	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2004-12-13.12.0	To be brief, I think my hon Friend is referring to the way the overlapping benefit rule operates between carer's allowance and state pension. People's income is never reduced, but when those who qualify for carer's allowance get to state retirement age and start receiving their state pension, they cannot receive both, because technically those two benefits overlap. Nobody's income should go down, even though the overlapping benefit rule applies to carer's allowance and the state pension. There is the carer's premium in the income-related benefits—it is the additional amount in pension credit—which gives poorer pensioners an extra £25.55 a week, so it is still worth claiming carer's allowance if the person being cared for is in receipt of attendance allowance.	2004-12-13a.1392.1	An ever-increasing number of elderly people are looking after elderly relatives or other elderly people. When they reach a certain age, their benefit can drop, which creates problems for the carer and the person being cared for. If we are to encourage members of the family to look after their parents and relatives, we must ensure that there is no reduction in their income. Some of these people also experience difficulties in receiving attendance allowance. Will my hon Friend make sure that that situation is not allowed to develop, and will she introduce practices to ensure that people receive the proper reward for looking after elderly people?	2004-12-13a.1392.0	person/10460	person/10183	True	2004-12-13	blair	False	False	0	Work And Pensions	Work And Pensions	Carers	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

It is important to understand that criminal justice policy and legislation are not for the House alone; they must go out right across estates such as those in my hon Friend's constituency. In Nottinghamshire, as elsewhere throughout the country, we now have local criminal justice boards whose job it is to ensure that these policies are better communicated to build public confidence in the criminal justice system. The local criminal justice boards have to produce an annual report and can also publish newsletters and other forms of communication.

Is she aware that one of the major ways to address the drugs problem north and south of the border is by a massive increase in rehabilitation facilities?

I am happy to reassure him that we are working with the Department for Transport on the British Transport police, with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport on the parks police, and with the Department of Trade and Industry on the atomic energy police. We are making sure that we get the same standards across the police. Joined-up, effective policing is our top priority.	2003-06-16.6.2	While I have reservations about a police force reporting to what I regard as an unaccountable body—Merseytravel—and about Merseytravel's using public funds to pursue judicial review against what I regard as well-intentioned comments by the coroner, is it not time to have a thorough look at all the quasi-independent, non-territorial police forces, which have a tendency to become fiefdoms without common standards or automatic recourse to the Police Complaints Authority? Is it not time that we considered whether they might be brought into the general policing effort and the regular constabularies?

2003-06-16.3.0	"In spite of the additional resources that I have just mentioned, the deployment of community support officers and the additional 2,000 officers in the Metropolitan police over the 18 months to last September, there is undoubtedly a problem. I raised that problem with the Met commissioner last week, and the police are monitoring the situation and developing graphs showing the incidence of street crimes, burglary, vehicle crime and crime in other targeted areas in relation to the number of officers available.
In the boroughs, an average of eight or nine officers are being taken out each week for the present surveillance in central London. The commissioner and I believe that we need to examine the situation further and to ensure that complementary work is done by those examining the danger of terrorism and those undertaking normal day-to-day duties. I am keen to reassure my hon Friend that we are on top of the situation and are demonstrating that more police, more visible police and more back-up from community support officers make a difference, but that we must make that difference not only in central London, where crime has dropped dramatically, but in boroughs such as my hon Friend's."	2003-06-16.7.1	I appreciate that it is difficult to address heightened security in central London. However, the abstraction of officers from local police forces is having a debilitating effect on their strategies to deal with antisocial behaviour and other crimes in our communities. The people of Eltham and Plumstead deserve as much security in their homes and communities as do those in central London. In approaching this issue in future, might it be possible to scrutinise the abstraction of officers to ensure that they are taken only for essential services, because their abstraction is having a damaging effect locally?	2003-06-16.7.0	person/10185	person/10050	True	2003-06-16	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Policing (London)	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

In the mid-1990s, in the days when the Opposition were starting the process of running down the police force, the crisis was a reality because fewer police meant a crisis on the streets. If more police, more CSOs and more visibility is a crisis, the word has taken on an entirely different meaning.	2003-06-16.7.3	I am glad that the Secretary of State recognises that there is a problem. Is he aware that it is persistent in the London borough of Bromley and that it was made worse recently when we learned that the number of additional police officers we were expecting this year has been halved due to what is called a funding crisis in the Metropolitan police?

That was stepped up again to meet people's fears of reaction to the conflict in Iraq. I have already demonstrated that the commissioner and I are keen to take a further look at the matter and to ensure that the improvement in inner London has not been made to the detriment of those in the outer boroughs.
I can do nothing other than accept the hon Gentleman's strictures on neighbourhood policing, because, on 5 December 2001 , I published a White Paper that spelt out clearly that that was the Government's objective. We have been gratified to learn both from the commissioner and from chief constables that there is recognition that the switch away from neighbourhood and community policing a decade ago was a mistake."	2003-06-16.8.2	"I join in the Home Secretary's welcome to his team, and especially in his birthday greetings to the Under-Secretary, the hon Member for Wythenshawe and Sale, East (Paul Goggins) .

Do not the figures show clearly that, as hon Members on both sides of the House have said, removing police officers from one area to deal with problems in another simply creates a vacuum for crime? Extraction as routine practice rather than in dire emergency is merely a measure of the fact that not enough police officers are available; so does the Secretary of State accept, as his speech last week appeared to, our proposals and policies for dedicated neighbourhood policing, with specific career and accountability structures to ensure that the police really are where our constituents expect to see them—on the streets?"	2003-06-16.8.1	person/10470	person/10050	False	2003-06-16	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Policing (London)	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2003-06-16.4.0	I suspect that one reason why I have been appointed to this role is absolutely to do that, because I will have responsibility for volunteering and citizenship activity and for racial equality. I really believe that making those contacts with communities and enabling other Departments to ensure that they engage communities and that the race equality aspects of their policies are effective will be key in delivering the responsibilities that the Home Secretary has given me.	2003-06-16.9.1	"I thank my hon Friend for that response and congratulate her and my hon Friend the Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint) on their appointments to the Front Bench.

2003-06-16.4.1	The hon Gentleman is right that special constables form a very important part of civic engagement, and I am pleased to note that many special constables in my area have taken up full-time employment with the police, as we are increasing police recruitment. I suspect that the number of special constables has fallen because many of them have been able to take on professional responsibilities and use their experience as specials to enable them to become professional police officers. I hope that more people will take that route into serving our communities.	2003-06-16.9.3	I congratulate the hon Lady on her appointment. Does she agree that there is probably no better way to be an active citizen than to become a special constable? As a Thames valley Member herself, will she explain why she thinks that the number of special constables has fallen by so much and what the Government will do to try to reverse the trend?	2003-06-16.9.2	person/10777	person/10402	False	2003-06-16	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Active Citizenship	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2003-06-16.4.2	I thank my hon Friend for her generous remarks. I agree that we have to work to free our society from bigotry and the way in which bigotry and prejudice fuel attacks and diminish people's rights. Part of the way to do that is through legislation, but there is more to be done by challenging attitudes, engaging communities and so on. I hope that we will go forward on both those fronts to deliver an effective way to engage people properly and to diminish the bigotry and prejudice that blight our communities.	2003-06-16.9.5	May I offer my warmest congratulations to my hon Friend on her promotion to the Front Bench? Does she agree that active citizenship can flourish only in an atmosphere where bigotry and hatred are banished and unacceptable? To that end, does she agree that we still have much to do in relation to equality law and updating our anti-discrimination legislation to ensure that all our citizens can be free from the horror of being discriminated against because of their beliefs, colour, gender, age or sexual orientation? Will she support further Government action to provide protections in those important areas?	2003-06-16.9.4	person/10182	person/10402	False	2003-06-16	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Active Citizenship	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

If I am wrong about that in any way—I am new to these responsibilities—I shall write to the hon Gentleman. Of course, there are expensive charges for professional staff, and that affects voluntary organisations, but it is important that we protect people effectively. It is also important that we do not inhibit people from volunteering because of the cost of checking criminal records.	2003-06-16.10.1	Does the Minister agree that nothing is more important to community engagement and active citizenship than schools and voluntary organisations working with young people? Can she explain why—after a year's disruption caused by the delays and incompetence of the Criminal Records Bureau and the appalling company, Capita—those organisations are now faced with a doubling of charges?	2003-06-16.10.0	person/10084	person/10402	False	2003-06-16	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Active Citizenship	0	liberal-democrat	False	False	labour	True	False
2003-06-16.5.0	I thank my hon Friend for his good wishes and for raising an important problem, especially when children are using weapons for violent activities. Although North Yorkshire is not in the street crime initiative area, I hope that his local area, and the wider area of North Yorkshire, will benefit from the lessons learned from the initiative through the spread of best practice. At 30 September 2002 , there were 131,548 police officers in England and Wales, and 1,404 police officers in North Yorkshire, compared with 1,305 the previous year. Those are record numbers, but we need to look at sharing best practice and initiatives across the whole of England and Wales.	2003-06-16.10.6	I, too, congratulate my hon Friend on her appointment to the Front Bench. York is one of the safest cities in the country, which is one reason that it attracts so many visitors. Nevertheless, there has been a significant increase in robbery—a threefold increase over the last three years—which, in a few cases, has involved the use of knives, particularly by young children. What are the Government doing to help police forces, such as North Yorkshire police and other law enforcement agencies, to get on top of this problem?	2003-06-16.10.5	person/10029	person/10202	True	2003-06-16	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Knives	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2003-06-16.5.1	I am pleased to report to the hon Gentleman that street crime has continued to fall. The most recent figures on robbery were published on 4 April 2003 as part of the quarterly crime update. Recorded robbery fell by an estimated 23 per cent. in the period from October to December 2002 compared with the same period in 2001.	2003-06-16.11.1	The Minister said that in the first six months of the street crime initiative street crime had fallen.

The Metropolitan police safer streets initiative has had considerable success and he will be aware that we are looking at extending fixed penalty notices under the Anti-social Behaviour Bill, which is currently proceeding through Parliament. I am sure that my colleagues on the Front Bench will have heard his latter remarks.	2003-06-16.11.3	In congratulating my hon Friend on her recent appointment, may I ask her to welcome initiatives in Croydon in combating offensive weapons, in particular, charging without a caution anyone with a knife and, from today, banning street drinking in the centre of Croydon so that people who carry bottles, which can be used as offensive weapons, face fixed penalty notices from our new band of police community officers? Will she reassure the House that investment in those front-line services will continue? Will she also talk to other Home Office Ministers, including the Secretary of State, about the possibility of hypothecating the income from these fines on drunken yobs for front-line services to keep crime going down? In Croydon, it is down 6 per cent. in the last year.	2003-06-16.11.2	person/10159	person/10202	False	2003-06-16	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Knives	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

A number of offensive weapons are already banned, but I would be willing to listen to what he has to say, for him to come to see me about the weapons that he mentioned today and to consider whether further measures need to be taken both on display and on whether such weapons should be sold in the first place.	2003-06-16.12.2	Given that beat policemen are the best deterrent against street crime, and given the extreme difficulty of recruiting beat policemen in South Oxfordshire, what does the Minister have to say to Simon Dixon, a constituent of mine who recently applied to join the police, passed all the tests with flying colours, but was turned down on the ground that he had three tattoos on his upper arms: one of a man waving a flag, one of a dog, and one of a mouse sitting on a toadstool smoking a hubble-bubble pipe? None of those tattoos was visible when he was wearing a short-sleeved shirt, yet he was told that they might cause offence to hospital staff were he to be involved in an accident.

2003-06-16.6.0	"When I have more time to respond I would like to engage the hon Gentleman in discussion on why I think that the Tories' proposals are full of holes. Interestingly, Tory Front Benchers have commissioned Mr. Timothy Kirkhope—a former Minister with responsibility for immigration who was criticised by the Public Accounts Committee—to help them to fill the holes.
We need a broad strategy. We need immediate action to secure our borders, which we have done, and to transform our asylum system, which will include pilots for accommodation centres, because we need a system that can cope robustly with claims. We also need sustainable international solutions to the problems of global migration. We are discussing proposals with our EU partners. They have been generally warmly received and we want to make progress."	2003-06-16.13.0	May I commiserate with the hon Lady on the continuation of her extremely difficult duties? In view of the vehement and near unanimous hostility to the concept of open accommodation centres in the areas in which they may be located and of the fact that the overwhelming majority of immigrants stay here, regardless of the merit of their case, is there not a case for accelerating consideration of the policy of screening political asylum seekers outside the United Kingdom, as proposed by the Conservative party?	2003-06-16.12.6	person/10615	person/10296	True	2003-06-16	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Asylum Seekers	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2003-06-16.6.1	We currently have no plans to process asylum seekers on the borders of the EU, which several newspapers have reported. There is no prospect of any camps—Sangatte-style or otherwise. We want to take forward ideas for regional protection processing, which has the support of the UNHCR. I assure my hon Friend that those arrangements will conform to our obligations under international conventions. We are making progress on ideas that are important to develop international co-operative responses, but we have never said that those proposals would obviate the need for a robust and comprehensive system in this country, as I said in my first answer. We anticipate that when people claim here, we will have to continue to process some of their claims here.	2003-06-16.13.2	As screening posts will be outside this country and, indeed, outside countries that signed up to the 1951 Geneva convention, will the Minister confirm that convention standards will apply and that if people applied for asylum at a centre but were not accepted they could still make an in-country application if they arrived in this country and could make a genuine case?	2003-06-16.13.1	person/10133	person/10296	False	2003-06-16	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Asylum Seekers	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

I am extremely happy to be carrying on with my responsibilities, which are very important for this country and internationally. He and I have discussed that and I know he understands what an important and interesting area it is.
We agree that the important issue, which has always been our priority in such international discussions, is to improve regional protection for people. His point about the importance of enabling people to claim as close as possible to the areas from which they are fleeing is an important priority. In relation to claims within EU countries, as I have said throughout my responses to such questions, it is very important both that EU countries act together and that we continue to have a robust, clear and appropriate system within our countries. We have always envisaged that that would need to continue because claims would be made in individual countries. Here in the UK we need to be able to process those claims quickly and efficiently."	2003-06-16.13.4	"On behalf of all my party colleagues, will the Minister pass on our congratulations and welcome to her colleagues, with whom we look forward to working, and her best wishes to those who have moved on?
Does the Minister agree that Her Majesty's Government should adopt a twin-track approach on asylum seekers? First, we should encourage asylum seekers to seek asylum at the nearest possible place to the country from which they come, and the UK Government should assist those countries, which are often poor, to deal with asylum seekers who want to come to Europe, often in ever greater numbers. Secondly, we should honour proudly our commitment to uphold the 1951 convention for those who come to Europe and give asylum to those who need it. Does she agree that we should share responsibility and not shirk it, and that all people who apply in an EU country should be processed there and be dealt with fairly and justly at all times by that country?"	2003-06-16.13.3	person/10298	person/10296	False	2003-06-16	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Asylum Seekers	0	liberal-democrat	False	False	labour	True	False
2003-06-16.6.3	I understand that that is so, and perhaps it is one of the consequences of that aspect of the Australian system. It is more straightforward for Australia to do that. It may also be a response to other aspects of the Australian system. However, my hon Friend is right to highlight that every country, irrespective of its system, needs to have robust measures, including international co-operation, to tackle illegal trafficking and the activities of criminal gangs, which fuel illegal immigration and the rise in asylum claims. We are doing that substantially both with France and other European countries, not only in those close to home but in source countries and those with the transit routes, which criminal gangs use to bring people into this country.	2003-06-16.14.1	My hon Friend will be aware that Australia uses another country—the island of Nauru—to process its asylum applications. Since that system was introduced, has there not been a dramatic reduction in the amount of people trafficking into that country?	2003-06-16.14.0	person/10049	person/10296	False	2003-06-16	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Asylum Seekers	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2003-06-16.7.0	I proposed a quota system in the White Paper a year last February. Along with UNHCR, I am implementing the first steps, as of last 1 April , to do just that. However, we also have to deal with a situation in which quotas are irrelevant, which occurs when people reach our soil. Opposition Members, including the shadow Home Secretary, have to answer a simple question: if someone arrives in Britain from Zimbabwe and claims asylum, what do we do with him?	2003-06-16.15.1	Does the Home Secretary recognise that the only effective way of overcoming the asylum chaos is to scrap the existing system altogether and introduce a quota system for genuine refugees?	2003-06-16.15.0	person/11308	person/10050	True	2003-06-16	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Eu Constitution	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2003-06-16.7.1	Yes, I agree entirely. We need much greater co-operation, but not a unified and centrally operated force, along the new borders of the extended European Union. All parties in the House are committed to that. We have experimented with that by helping the Spanish with those who traverse the Mediterranean and the straits of Gibraltar, and we are doing the same with other countries. I hope that we can do much more. However, I hope that we can act in a civilised, rational and organised fashion once people are inside the EU.	2003-06-16.15.3	The Home Secretary may well have heard over recent days much huff and puff in many of the tabloid newspapers about the draft constitutional treaty and what it will do to border controls and asylum and immigration in Europe. Will he ignore all that nonsense and focus on the genuine issue at hand, which is ensuring that we have a better integrated system with the rest of Europe so that we have justice and fairness for those who claim asylum and seek to immigrate?	2003-06-16.15.2	person/10761	person/10050	False	2003-06-16	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Eu Constitution	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2003-06-16.7.2	"On the latter point, I make it abundantly clear that not a single measure that we are taking would be ruled out or disqualified by the changes to be put to the intergovernmental conference in October—not one.
On internal border controls, the Government secured, and have had for some time, an opt-out clause on all those matters, including Schengen. The opt-outs remain and are not affected by the Convention's discussions and proposals. I am simply stating a fact. It is no good Opposition Members dreaming up a different protocol, a different Convention and a different constitution, presenting that constitution to the British people and asking them to vote it down when it bears no resemblance to the reality of what the Government are prepared to sign up to."	2003-06-16.15.5	"I do not understand the Home Secretary's comments about the EU constitution. In its draft form it explicitly says that the Union
""shall ensure the absence of internal border controls for persons and shall frame a common policy on asylum, immigration and external border control"".
Does he agree with the Leader of the House that that is just a bit of ""tidying up"", because that appears to be at variance with my understanding of the text?
Secondly, the Minister for Citizenship and Immigration said that even if we had international co-operation we would still need robust measures to deal with issues such as asylum. Will it not become impossible to take those robust measures nationally? If so, will the Home Secretary kindly tell the House whether, in those circumstances, the Government intend to veto the proposal, or will he explain why the sacrifice needs to be made to accept it?"	2003-06-16.15.4	person/10243	person/10050	False	2003-06-16	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Eu Constitution	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2003-06-16.7.3	Yes, I am certain. I can tell my hon Friend that neither I nor the Prime Minister or the Foreign Secretary would sign up to anything that precluded our getting off an escalator that was going somewhere that we did not wish to go.	2003-06-16.16.1	But is not an opt-out, by definition, something that comes to an end? Is my right hon Friend sure that the clause recently added to the Convention, which enables the Commission to change, by its own internal arrangements, the controls over not only immigration but other aspects of the legal system normally decided by the House of Commons, will not have a direct impact irrespective of any opt-out that we hold at the moment?	2003-06-16.16.0	person/10181	person/10050	False	2003-06-16	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Eu Constitution	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2003-06-16.8.0	"We are tackling some significant issues that make it difficult to remove people when their applications fail, including the problem of redocumenting them to the satisfaction of the country from which they have come. However, we are working actively with those countries, including instituting interviews by high commissioners in detention centres, to make sure that we can redocument people. I am sure that the hon Gentleman will understand that, without documentation, we simply cannot put people on planes and ship them out. However, we are addressing that issue.
We are using the detention estate much more effectively so that we can bring people to the point of removal and then get them out of the country. We are processing people more quickly, we are issuing them all with ID cards, and we require them to report regularly. We are therefore keeping in contact with people. Through those measures, we are able to increase, as I have said, the number of people who are removed. However, we need to go further. Eurodac, the international system that came online in January, enables us to identify whether people have claimed before—here or in another European country. There is a range of robust measures to increase the number of people removed, but it is equally important to reduce the intake. The hon Gentleman will know that the combined measures that we took with France produced a reduction of 32 per cent. in the first quarter of this year. Reducing the intake is just as important as removing more people."	2003-06-16.17.0	"I thank the Minister for what I hope is hopeful news. Has she read the Home Affairs Committee report of April, which said that it was unsatisfactory that the Government could not even offer a rough estimate of the number of failed asylum seekers remaining in the UK? As it seems that at least 80 per cent. of those who have failed after lengthy and costly appeals remain here, should not the Government try to find out what is happening?
Is the Minister aware that, according to advice that I have had from my constituents, there is an easy way to remain here? One simply makes a new application in a different name in the next town and starts all over again. I have given the Minister details of individual cases. Will she consider the matter and find out why so many failed asylum seekers remain in this country without any apparent difficulty?"	2003-06-16.16.5	person/10591	person/10296	True	2003-06-16	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Asylum Seekers	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False

The new intake of asylum claims has now been processed, and 75 per cent. will get their initial decision in two months. Further resources have been put into appeals—6,000 asylum appeals a month are now dealt with, so appeals are processed much more quickly.
My hon Friend is wrong that the backlog is getting bigger. There is still a backlog, but clearly, as the number of new claims is reduced, we are able to invest more resources in reducing it. In fact, it is going down very considerably indeed. I hope that towards the end of this year we will only have work in progress, and will have eradicated the backlog completely."	2003-06-16.17.2	But when did those who have now been removed first apply for asylum? Many of my constituents are suffering grave disquiet because they have yet to be told whether their application has failed. Certainly, many who have been in this country for a considerable period have experienced a slowing down of the appeals process, most markedly in the acknowledgement of applications. I know that there has been an increase in both financial resources and personnel, but the backlog seems to be getting longer.

2003-06-16.8.2	The hon Gentleman is completely wrong. Indeed, the points that he made demonstrate strongly that this is a real issue of difference between the Opposition and the Government. He is completely wrong that there is any link at all between the asylum system and managed migration policies, including work permits. It is not possible for somebody who has claimed asylum to switch to a work permit or any other managed migration route. We make no apology for encouraging people to come here to work, provided that that is done in a regulated and transparent way. Our economy needs it, and we welcome people on that basis. Whether an application for a work permit is made in-country or for somebody outside, it is employers—British business people—who apply for work permits because they want people to work in their businesses and support the UK economy when they cannot employ an indigenous member of the population.	2003-06-16.18.1	Is there not an inconsistency between the Minister's robust language and the huge expansion in in-country work permits? Will she confirm that more than 100,000 work permits will be handed out this year to people in-country, many of them without any skills, who are being given a sweetener so that they do not apply for asylum?	2003-06-16.18.0	person/10065	person/10296	False	2003-06-16	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Asylum Seekers	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False

I am delighted that he has taken the initiative to go out with his local force and see for himself the situation on the ground. I am sure that a number of other Members have taken a similar step. My hon Friend is right that Lancashire, his police area, got 72 community support officers in the first round and another 35 in the second round. As street crime Minister for Lancashire, I had the pleasure of meeting some of the people who have taken up those roles, and I can say that they are making a tremendous impact on their communities. People welcome a strong, visible presence on the streets to make them feel safe, and they know that the Government are determined to make sure that we support people in communities to reclaim our streets and make communities safer.	2003-06-16.19.0	I warmly congratulate my hon Friend on her arrival in the Home Office, and thank her for the eight CSOs that we currently have in Blackpool and the further five that we are likely to get in the area in the next couple of months. Having recently spent an evening on the beat with my local police, I was particularly impressed by the way in which CSOs were being used to tackle antisocial behaviour in Blackpool, particularly through the confiscation of alcohol. Does my hon Friend agree that one of the crucial roles of CSOs is to reclaim the streets, especially to the benefit of older people and small businesses in the areas affected by antisocial behaviour, so that as a result of their presence there is a much greater sense of community solidarity?	2003-06-16.18.6	person/10415	person/10048	True	2003-06-16	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Community Support Officers	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

My hon Friend will be aware that there was an application from North Wales police for community support officers, and that they have been targeted in the Rhyl priority policing area. That is the decision of the chief constable. Clearly, there are funds available and we will have further rounds of community support officers. We want to encourage forces throughout the country to consider how they can get CSOs on the ground, helping their police forces to deliver improved community safety for everybody in our communities. I am happy to give my hon Friend the reassurance that we will try to encourage his area and others to apply.	2003-06-16.19.2	Regrettably, North Wales police was one of the forces that did not apply to supplement the high level of policing already in the area with the addition of community support officers. I know that the funding arrangements favour forces that were wise enough to make applications when the scheme first started. Will the Home Office, and my hon Friend with her new responsibilities, please reconsider those funding arrangements, to try to encourage the chief constable of North Wales and the North Wales police authority to take larger steps along the route of employing CSOs in the future?	2003-06-16.19.1	person/11057	person/10048	True	2003-06-16	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Community Support Officers	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2003-06-16.9.2	"I am delighted that the hon Gentleman has undergone something of a conversion. Reading the debate on the Police Reform Bill last year, it was apparent to me that the Opposition were lukewarm about community support officers. Now that they have seen that they are such a success on the ground, they would like to have them everywhere. I can tell him that I will be looking at the allocation criteria.
The Opposition may not have supported CSOs, but they are hugely popular throughout the country. Some of the comments that I have had from the Rhymney area include one from John Vaughn, aged 73, who said:
""I would say that having the officers patrolling our estate will give us more security, and I think that I will sleep a bit better at night.""
Elderly residents say that they can now go out in the evenings, which they could not do before. The introduction of CSOs is one of the most successful policies that the Government have implemented. I am delighted to welcome the hon Gentleman's support."	2003-06-16.20.0	I warmly congratulate the hon Lady on her appointment and wish her success in executing her responsibilities. Given that there might well be many people around the country, not least within the Aylesbury Vale district council area, of which my Buckingham constituency forms a part, who welcome the idea of community support officers but who face the prospect of being denied such a provision in practice, what assessment has she made within the past 72 hours of the transparency, consistency and objectivity of the criteria for allocation?	2003-06-16.19.3	person/10040	person/10048	False	2003-06-16	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Community Support Officers	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False

In the past 12 months, police numbers, not community support officer numbers, have risen by 4,337—the largest rise for 27 years, in a 12-month period, in the number of police officers on the ground. It is this Government who have been prepared to put in the resources, together with reform, to ensure that we can provide increased community safety for the people whom we represent.	2003-06-16.20.2	Although community support officers might give people some reassurance, it must be accepted that they have no powers. What most people want is more police on the beat and, to reassure them about crime levels, when they report a crime, they want a policeman to turn up. Often, when people ring the station, it says that there are not enough officers on duty to attend the scene of the crime.	2003-06-16.20.1	person/10646	person/10048	False	2003-06-16	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Community Support Officers	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2005-01-20.0.0	I thank the hon Gentleman for his kind words and pay tribute to him for the seriousness with which he approaches the subject. He is right to say that we must tackle absence. If we are to have an effect on the next generation, we must make sure that children get to school. We are the first Government to have invested directly in anti-truancy measures. The hon Gentleman is also right to draw attention to the fact that there is a stubborn, persistent number of children who are serial truants. We have to tackle that. The proportion has remained about 0.7 per cent. since records began. It is clear that schools are cracking down, and the number of authorised absences has fallen dramatically. Again, I congratulate the teachers and the local authority in the hon Gentleman's area, who are doing everything they can to make sure that children attend school and are ready to learn.	2005-01-20a.935.7	I congratulate the right hon Lady on her well deserved promotion and wish her well in her task ahead. Will she join me in thanking and paying tribute to all the head teachers in my constituency who have been working tirelessly to reduce truancy levels? They are doing their level best and working with Mrs. Val Creasy, the new education officer dealing with attendance. What progress are the Government making in reaching their targets? Does the right hon Lady agree that today's school drop-out is all too often tomorrow's criminal?	2005-01-20a.935.6	person/10726	person/10332	True	2005-01-20	blair	False	False	0	Education	Education And Skills	Truancy (East Anglia)	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2005-01-20.0.1	"I thank the hon Gentleman, too, for his kind words. As a parent, I share his objectives of good discipline in the classroom and good teaching, and children learning in a good learning environment. Over the next few weeks and months I intend to draw attention to Conservative policies, which would wreak havoc on our plans for school discipline, on our measures to tackle truancy and open up university access for all children, and on our support for working parents in East Anglia and elsewhere. [Interruption.] My hon Friend the Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay) is drawing attention to them, too.
The hon Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Mr. Collins) is right to say that children are entitled to a good disciplined learning environment. I am surprised that he criticises Labour's measures to ensure that there are fair admissions procedures, which are supported by Kent and Surrey county councils, among others, and head teachers in those Conservative councils are saying the Government are doing exactly the right thing. Yes, we must back head teachers in making disciplinary decisions, and in the decisions that they take on exclusions. We must also ensure that parents take their responsibilities seriously and get their children into school, with respect for learning and ready to learn."	2005-01-20a.936.1	"I, too, congratulate the Secretary of State on her promotion. As she and I have something in common, in that we both have young children, I am sure that our commitment to raising educational standards for everybody is shared, and is total. On the subject of truancy in East Anglia and elsewhere, does she agree that one of the measures necessary to reduce truancy is to give children a disciplined environment where they feel safe? I am sure that parents in East Anglia and elsewhere will agree with what she said, as reported in one of this morning's newspapers:
""Head teachers must be able to exclude difficult pupils.""
Why, then, earlier this week, did the Minister in her Department block an amendment in the other place that would have given head teachers the final say on exclusions?"	2005-01-20a.936.0	person/10125	person/10332	False	2005-01-20	blair	False	False	1	Education	Education And Skills	Truancy (East Anglia)	1	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False

It is no advantage to any hon Member if a Secretary of State fails in such a key policy area. Now that she has launched the general election campaign on East Anglia schools, does she agree—judging by her comments at the North of England education conference, I hope she will—that one of the key groups for increasing student attendance and dealing with truancy is parents? Parents in East Anglia and elsewhere must be able to be involved in what happens in schools. Can the Secretary of State therefore explain why the number of parent governors in the new foundation-status schools will be reduced from one third of the governing body to one, and why academies will have no parent governors—	2005-01-20a.936.4	person/10641	person/10332	False	2005-01-20	blair	False	False	0	Education	Education And Skills	Truancy (East Anglia)	1	liberal-democrat	False	False	labour	True	False
2005-01-20.1.0	Hon Members may be surprised to hear that I agree with the right hon Gentleman to a large extent. We must tackle bullying and create a culture in which every child is valued; indeed, we must have zero tolerance of bullying. There is a clear link between schools with a good record on bullying and attainment in those schools, as well as between LEAs with a good record on tackling bullying in schools and attainment in those LEAs. We have to create a new culture. I pay tribute to the work led by the Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills, my hon Friend the Member for Bury, South (Mr. Lewis) , who has personally taken charge of this programme. Pioneering work is taking place. Head teachers, and indeed pupils themselves, are telling the Department that they now realise that bullying must be tackled, and that they will stand up and fight it wherever it occurs.	2005-01-20a.937.6	As there is nothing more unacceptable in our schools than bullying and there should be zero tolerance of it, does the Secretary of State really think that having an anti-bullying week or an anti-bullying charter is sufficient? Do we not need to do much more? Does she agree that a high level of bullying is a clear sign of a poor and failing school?	2005-01-20a.937.5	person/10391	person/10332	True	2005-01-20	blair	False	False	0	Education	Education And Skills	Bullying	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2005-01-20.1.1	I completely agree with my hon Friend. Children tell us all the time that this matters to them. Not only do they not want to be bullied themselves, they want to learn in an environment where there is no bullying, and no toleration of bullying. That is why we are trying to change the culture, and learning mentors and support in the classroom have an important role to play. As a Government, we have secured a broad consensus across groups, working with teachers organisations as well as the voluntary sector and the Anti-Bullying Alliance. Many schools are signing up to the anti-bullying charter, and I should like that to be widespread across the country.	2005-01-20a.938.0	I congratulate my right hon Friend on her richly deserved new position, and I am pleased to see her in her place. My right hon Friend takes a keen interest in the welfare of children during the school day. Is she concerned, as I am, that some schools' approach to bullying is inconsistent with that of others that are more successful? The kind of school day that children have affects their home life, and can lead to truancy if they are too miserable to continue to go to school. Is it not important that we take a consistent and sustained approach to ensure that all schools engage with the problem, particularly through peer mentoring and other approaches that gather all pupils into the fold?	2005-01-20a.937.7	person/10448	person/10332	False	2005-01-20	blair	False	False	0	Education	Education And Skills	Bullying	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2005-01-20.1.2	Head teachers do that. If the hon Gentleman is referring to Conservative proposals to get rid of independent appeal panels, may I remind him that only 149 out of 9,290 permanently excluded pupils were reinstated by that process? Everyone can see that the facts speak for themselves.	2005-01-20a.938.2	But should not head teachers have the right to expel children who are bullying, without being second-guessed by another body?	2005-01-20a.938.1	person/10397	person/10332	False	2005-01-20	blair	False	False	0	Education	Education And Skills	Bullying	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2005-01-20.1.3	I thank my hon Friend for her kind words, and I entirely agree with her question. We are making real efforts to tackle bullying and I think that that is having an impact on schools, but of course there is much more to be done. For instance, teenagers should be able to engage in activities not just at school but outside. I shall return to that subject in due course. I recently looked at evidence from surveys in which parents were asked what they wanted, and top of the list were things for their teenage children to do. This Government are prepared to do something about that, whereas the Conservatives refuse to take it seriously. They would slash local education authority budgets, and they say that they would not protect any of the money that goes into such programmes.	2005-01-20a.938.4	I join others in congratulating my right hon Friend on her promotion. Is she aware that there have been problems with bullying, and wider disciplinary problems, in some Northampton schools, partly as a result of reorganisation? I agree that heads should be able to exclude pupils, but should there not be facilities outside schools so that children who are excluded can be picked up, receive a good education and return to mainstream schooling as quickly as possible, which is in their long-term interests?	2005-01-20a.938.3	person/10328	person/10332	False	2005-01-20	blair	False	False	0	Education	Education And Skills	Bullying	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2005-01-20.1.4	"We have come to the independent appeal panels at long last! I have quoted authoritative figures showing that head teachers have the power to exclude pupils. The hon Lady is right, however: we must take every child seriously. My right hon Friend the Minister for Children, Young People and Families has been promoting that agenda, and we have published proposals entitled ""Every Child Matters"". In future, the role of local authorities will be to ensure that the needs of every child are met, both academically and in terms of their overall welfare. I should like the hon Lady to confirm, now or later, that the Conservative party would keep education welfare officers at local authority level—or would it scrap them?"	2005-01-20a.939.0	I, too, welcome the Secretary of State to her new post. Most schools take bullying very seriously, and their policies enable victims to report incidents on a confidential basis. They also provide staff and pupil mentors to counsel both victims and bullies, which is important. The most insidious form of bullying, however, is unseen and sometimes occurs outside school. Does the Secretary of State acknowledge the important role of parents in tackling this problem? Without that role, policies implemented in schools would be hampered. In the interests of ensuring that parents accept responsibility for their children's unacceptable behaviour and for trying to modify it, will the Secretary of State give teachers the freedom and flexibility to draw up enforceable home-school contracts and to have the final say on exclusions, by scrapping independent appeal panels?	2005-01-20a.938.5	person/11308	person/10332	False	2005-01-20	blair	False	False	0	Education	Education And Skills	Bullying	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2005-01-20.2.0	I pay tribute to my hon Friend and to the work that he does with representatives of the manufacturing sector in his constituency, which I have had the pleasure of visiting twice. He is right to pay attention to the role that apprenticeships will play, particularly in the manufacturing sector. The Government have set up sector skills councils, which will take forward a programme to ensure that the vocational education, training and apprenticeships that we are delivering are relevant to the employment that young people will later enter. Overall, the number of young people participating in apprenticeships has risen from 75,000 in 1997 to 242,000 today.	2005-01-20a.939.5	I am delighted to welcome my right hon Friend to her new position. Tomorrow in Stafford I shall host, with Perkins Diesel, a seminar on apprenticeships in manufacturing. Does my right hon Friend agree that after the Tories in government devastated manufacturing and apprenticeships, Labour in government restored both to good health? Manufacturers attending tomorrow's seminar can be confident that British manufacturing has a bright future, and that they therefore can and should invest in apprenticeships.	2005-01-20a.939.4	person/10338	person/10332	True	2005-01-20	blair	False	False	0	Education	Education And Skills	Apprenticeships	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2005-01-20.2.1	I agree that there are skills shortages, particularly in the manufacturing and engineering sectors. We need to raise skill levels so that we can compete on the basis of quality, not of price. We will not be able to do that unless more young people aim not only for level 2 but for level 3 and the specialised level 4 skills. I do not want to pre-empt any announcements that I shall make in the House in the weeks to come, but we intend to prioritise vocational skills and apprenticeships in response to the Tomlinson report on 14 to 19-year-olds' education, and we shall seek to take that even further in the forthcoming skills White Paper.	2005-01-20a.940.1	The national employers' skills survey found that 2.4 million workers lacked the necessary skills to do their job. Does the Secretary of State agree that we need to focus on providing more support for modern apprenticeships? What will she do to provide more training places for plumbers, electricians and other trades in Essex, where there is a dire shortage of such skills?	2005-01-20a.940.0	person/11245	person/10332	False	2005-01-20	blair	False	False	0	Education	Education And Skills	Apprenticeships	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2005-01-20.2.2	I completely agree with my hon Friend. We need not only to raise the interest of young people in manufacturing as a career, but to give them experience of what it is like to work in the sector, if they feel attracted to it. That is why, in our response to the Tomlinson report, I shall seek to achieve just that, by ensuring that we put the same emphasis on vocational education and workplace experience as we do on the academic side. It is really important to the future of our economy that young people are allowed to raise their aspirations, so that they think it is worth continuing to learn and raise their skill levels, and end up with skills that are recognised and valued by employers.	2005-01-20a.940.3	I join other hon Members in welcoming my right hon Friend to her post. It is certainly richly deserved. I acknowledge the progress that has been made on the recruitment of modern apprentices. Does she agree, however, that in trying to fill the skills gap that still exists in manufacturing industry, it is necessary to raise the level of interest in manufacturing industry among high-quality young students in schools at a much earlier stage? Will she undertake to support initiatives that are designed to do just that?	2005-01-20a.940.2	person/10683	person/10332	False	2005-01-20	blair	False	False	0	Education	Education And Skills	Apprenticeships	0	labourco-operative	False	False	labour	True	False
2005-01-20.2.3	"My hon Friend the Minister for Lifelong Learning, Further and Higher Education, who is sitting beside me, tells me that the facility in the hon Gentleman's constituency is indeed a very good one. Perhaps I shall have the chance to visit it at some point. I know that the hon Gentleman shows a consistent interest in manufacturing, and he is right to draw attention to its needs and to say that we need to encourage young people into the sector. The Government are setting up sector skills councils, which bring together employers to identify the appropriate skill needs and to think of ways of tailoring to their needs courses that will be appreciated by young people.
The sector skills agreement, reached by the sector skills council—which, unfortunately, I believe the hon Gentleman's party is set to abolish—provides a means for employers not only to shape training, but to challenge each other to work together and put funding directly into training, which is relevant to industry's needs and also offers ways into employment and future career progression for young people."	2005-01-20a.941.0	The Secretary of State will be aware from her previous jobs that manufacturing industry is one of the main sources of sustainable non-inflationary economic growth. There is a college in my constituency that works in conjunction with BAE Systems and is known to be a centre of excellence for aerospace studies. I fully support the question that the hon Member for West Bromwich, West (Mr. Bailey) has just asked the Secretary of State. What further initiatives are the Government prepared to take to encourage young people to go into manufacturing and to undertake the apprenticeships that are so vital to the manufacturing sector?	2005-01-20a.940.4	person/10647	person/10332	False	2005-01-20	blair	False	False	0	Education	Education And Skills	Apprenticeships	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2005-01-20.3.0	I take great pleasure in assuring my hon Friend that I will take a personal interest in that matter, and I am sure that my right hon Friend the Secretary of State will, too. There is no doubt that universities are great economic drivers, and regions that do not have universities are the poorer without them. In view of the great manufacturing and extractive industrial history of my hon Friend's constituency and the surrounding area, the potential for a university there should be tapped, and we must ensure that it is. That applies especially to parts of industry that are in decline, such as the nuclear industry. It could provide a great research base for a university in Cumbria.	2005-01-20a.941.5	A big thank you to my hon Friend for that very encouraging reply. West Cumbria is one place in the country that does not have easy access to a university. Progress is being made in that direction, but will my hon Friend and the Secretary of State take a personal interest in ensuring that the dream of a university in west Cumbria, which has long been held by many people, becomes a reality?	2005-01-20a.941.4	person/10834	person/10294	True	2005-01-20	blair	False	False	0	Education	Education And Skills	Higher Education (West Cumbria)	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2005-01-20.4.0	I absolutely agree with my hon Friend. When we look at the A-level figures, it is quite striking to see that there has been a slow decline in the number of young people taking A-levels in modern foreign languages. At the same time, however, the number going into higher education to study modern foreign languages has been broadly stable, and the number combining languages with other subjects in higher education is increasing. There are lessons to be learned from that positive experience of higher education, which we can apply to A-level study, as my hon Friend suggests.	2005-01-20a.942.4	Does my hon Friend agree that we need to encourage more students who are doing A-levels in science subjects to continue to study a modern language? We live in a globalising world, and in a typical career nowadays, a scientist or engineer is likely to work in several different countries. We need to find more flexibility in the sixth-form curriculum to allow scientists to continue to study languages.	2005-01-20a.942.3	person/10029	person/10611	True	2005-01-20	blair	False	False	0	Education	Education And Skills	Foreign Languages	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2005-01-20.4.1	I believe that we took the right decision, because languages are an option that many young people do not want to take at 14. If they have to, they may not only lose out themselves, but hold back other young people who are motivated to learn languages. The key to whether the hon Gentleman is right lies much earlier in our schools system. That is why we are placing such great emphasis on primary school language teaching and learning.	2005-01-20a.942.6	Is the Government's decision to remove a modern foreign language from the core subjects of the national curriculum likely to improve the situation? The Minister has already admitted that the situation is fairly dismal, with the number of students opting for foreign languages at A-level declining year on year.	2005-01-20a.942.5	person/10106	person/10611	False	2005-01-20	blair	False	False	0	Education	Education And Skills	Foreign Languages	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2005-01-20.4.2	My hon Friend is right. In 2001 only one in five primary schools provided any foreign language teaching. I am delighted to inform hon Members that the most recent survey suggests that that figure has doubled; indeed, it is now 44 per cent. That is not good enough, but it constitutes major progress by primary schools in the past three years. By 2010, we want every seven to 11-year-old to have the opportunity to learn at least one foreign language in classroom time, and we are working hard to achieve that.	2005-01-20a.943.0	Should we not be ashamed of the poverty of our foreign language teaching? I encourage the Minister to follow up what he said at the end of that answer. There is a great deal of evidence to show that the neurological development of children makes it much easier for them to learn foreign languages at infant and junior school level. That is buttressed by evidence from Welsh language schools, Scottish Gaelic schools and Gaeltacht in the Republic of Ireland, showing that people who learn foreign languages at a very early age prove more successful across the whole range of academia. We should therefore be teaching French, German and other languages in our infant and junior schools for children of all abilities. That is where we need to make progress.	2005-01-20a.942.7	person/10393	person/10611	False	2005-01-20	blair	False	False	0	Education	Education And Skills	Foreign Languages	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2005-01-20.4.3	This is a very consensual discussion; the hon Gentleman is right. We are doing specific work on Mandarin now. When the languages strategy was first published, we talked about enabling children to learn a European language. We have revised our definition for several reasons, including the persuasive case for Mandarin to be part of that strategy. We would like that to be extended across the board.	2005-01-20a.943.2	We are a pretty lazy nation at learning languages. We think that everyone else should learn English and that we can simply sail along. When the Minister encourages young people to learn foreign languages so that they can go on to take A-levels and perhaps go into businesses afterwards, will he examine the teaching of Mandarin? China will be vital to the younger generations, and we need to train teachers now so that young people can learn Mandarin at an early age.	2005-01-20a.943.1	person/10190	person/10611	False	2005-01-20	blair	False	False	0	Education	Education And Skills	Foreign Languages	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2005-01-20.5.0	I agree with my hon Friend and I am delighted to join him in congratulating Hendon school on its success. We have 207 specialist language colleges, which are critical to providing the highest quality of language teaching and learning, not only in language schools but in others, including primary schools. I gave the figures for the increase in the number of language lessons in primary schools. Part of the explanation for that increase is that teachers from schools such as Hendon not only teach in their own schools but go out to neighbouring primaries and teach there.	2005-01-20a.943.6	Two weeks ago, I joined French, German and Japanese classes for a day at Hendon school, a specialist language college. The teaching quality was excellent and teaching methods were in a completely different league from when I was at school. The teachers engaged students of all abilities effectively. Does my hon Friend agree that learning a language is not only for able and enthusiastic linguists but that it provides a key life skill to enable all students to become effective world citizens? It should not be limited, because it enriches horizons and aspirations and has a positive impact on all aspects of the curriculum.	2005-01-20a.943.5	person/10169	person/10611	True	2005-01-20	blair	False	False	0	Education	Education And Skills	Foreign Languages	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2005-01-20.5.1	Yes, the hon Gentleman is right to talk about making language learning exciting. Part of the reason for our action on language teaching for 14-year-olds was because of the number of young people who were demotivated and switched off. We need to start teaching and learning earlier, but we must also use work force reform as an opportunity to bring others into the classroom, including the language assistants to whom the hon Gentleman referred. I have seen some great examples of schools in this country being twinned with schools in Spain. There is a positive process for the development of the teachers' skills and for better learning opportunities for the children and young people.	2005-01-20a.944.1	We in Northern Ireland, on a small island, have realised for a long time that we must pay attention to foreign languages. Indeed, in many primary schools foreign languages are exciting for our children. We must get away from the stiff, academic approach. Does the Minister agree that the involvement of assistants from overseas plays a big part in making foreign languages real? Can we do more to encourage more schools to involve foreign language assistants?	2005-01-20a.944.0	person/10033	person/10611	False	2005-01-20	blair	False	False	0	Education	Education And Skills	Foreign Languages	0	uup	False	False	labour	True	False

I am delighted to congratulate Montgomery high school in my hon Friend's constituency, which offers a really good example of what I referred to when I spoke about the 207 specialist language colleges. We must encourage schools to have direct links with schools and communities in other parts of the world. That is why, late last year, we launched the ""global gateway"", which is a very good way of promoting more understanding and of breaking down barriers between people. It is also a way to encourage the excitement about language learning that a number of hon Members have mentioned."	2005-01-20a.944.3	Will my hon Friend join me in congratulating Montgomery high school in Blackpool? It is a language college, is actively engaged with primary and secondary schools across the whole town, and is also twinned with schools in other countries. With the council, it has embarked on an exciting initiative to send pupils to Bottrop, Blackpool's twin town, for a week's work experience. That means that students have to use their language skills in a work placement in a foreign country.	2005-01-20a.944.2	person/10299	person/10611	False	2005-01-20	blair	False	False	0	Education	Education And Skills	Foreign Languages	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2005-01-20.5.3	I am concerned about the second point that the hon Lady raises. We intend to address the problem, but there is no intention to reverse the proposal to which she referred. We want there to be more choice and flexibility in the phase of education for 14 to 19-year-olds. We do not want to return to greater compulsion being placed on schools and learners, and I do not think that the way to improve our country's very poor record on languages is to force young people aged 14, 15 or 16 to do them against their will. We must do it by tapping into the excitement evident at a younger age, which is why our strategy deliberately focuses on primary school language teaching and learning. That is where we are putting in resources, and our approach commands very wide support.	2005-01-20a.945.0	I speak some foreign languages, which I found immensely useful in my legal practice work in Brussels and in the European Parliament. Will the Minister reverse the Government's decision to end compulsory language teaching for 14 to 19-year-olds? It has had a dire effect on the number of people studying languages and, as a result, on the business community around the country. Is he concerned that the students who drop out of school foreign languages classes tend to be boys rather than girls?	2005-01-20a.944.4	person/10389	person/10611	False	2005-01-20	blair	False	False	0	Education	Education And Skills	Foreign Languages	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2005-01-20.6.0	I thank my hon Friend for his kind comments. I can give a clear example of what he seeks. The increased flexibility of the programme for 14 to 16-year-olds is an excellent example of how local LSCs and LEAs work together constructively in local partnerships to improve learning opportunities for young people. The scheme is in its third year, with about 300 partnerships in existence. There are some partnerships in every LSC area, and they involve more than 90,000 young people from 2,000 schools.	2005-01-20a.945.5	I congratulate my hon Friend on his appointment to the Front Bench, and thank him for that response. Two reviews are taking place in St. Helens at present, one of schools and the other of post-16 provision. What advice can he offer about how organisations can ensure that they work together and produce the best options for parents and young people?	2005-01-20a.945.4	person/10625	person/10610	True	2005-01-20	blair	False	False	0	Education	Education And Skills	Planning And Co-Ordination	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2005-01-20.6.1	The hon Gentleman raises a very important matter. We are reviewing the situation, and will make an announcement shortly.	2005-01-20a.946.0	I, too, welcome the Minister to his post. Will he look again at the changes being made to the Connexions service, especially in respect of careers advice in schools? Real problems are being caused in many of the schools in my constituency, and I suspect that the same is happening elsewhere. I understand the concentration on helping pupils of modest achievements, but all the students in a college like Frome community college need careers advice. However, the college has lost its specialist careers adviser, which means that it has lost an essential ingredient in ensuring that young people are directed towards the right training and higher education after the ages of 16 and 18, and towards the right future career paths.	2005-01-20a.945.6	person/10269	person/10610	False	2005-01-20	blair	False	False	0	Education	Education And Skills	Planning And Co-Ordination	0	liberal-democrat	False	False	labour	True	False
2005-01-20.6.2	I congratulate the schools in question, which have obviously done a very good job. We have to get the basics right, and our literacy and numeracy strategies have been working well. Standards are at their highest ever. Starting with Sure Start, we are making sure that that goes right through schooling.	2005-01-20a.946.2	I, too, congratulate my hon Friend on his promotion. He may be aware that Luton recently had a difficult 14 to 19 inspection, but that is countered by good news, because Barnfield college and Luton sixth form college in my constituency both received grade 1 in their inspection and are both now beacon status colleges. Also, two high schools have now left special measures and are making strong progress. Does my hon Friend agree that the problems in 14 to 19 education derive mainly from problems in primary education 10 and more years ago, now that that cohort has reached the 14 to 19 stage? The Government's correct emphasis on primary education will feed through and lead to improvements in the future.	2005-01-20a.946.1	person/10288	person/10610	False	2005-01-20	blair	False	False	0	Education	Education And Skills	Planning And Co-Ordination	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2005-01-20.7.0	I think that the graduate training programme has been an enormous success so far. The news today is that lots of quite senior professionals are going into teaching. They have decided to take up teaching as a career—and it is a great career. I can reassure the hon Gentleman that we will take every precaution to ensure that anomalies do not exist and that we see a good take-up of PGCE places, with a good supply of teachers in the future.	2005-01-20a.947.0	I am grateful to the Minister for that slightly complex answer. At least we now know a little more about what will happen. Does he agree, however, that given that those on the graduate training programme do not have to pay for the costs of their training, there will be an anomaly with those who are on the PGCE course and charged variable fees, even if part is remitted?	2005-01-20a.946.6	person/10502	person/10294	True	2005-01-20	blair	False	False	0	Education	Education And Skills	Tuition Fees	0	liberal-democrat	False	False	labour	True	False
2005-01-20.7.1	Yes, and I know that my hon Friend is passionate about working with all the bodies in his constituency and the wider region to try to increase applications to university. He knows, as I do, that the task is very complex, because it means addressing the most pernicious problem of poverty of aspirations in so many of our communities in areas such as the one that he represents. That is the great task before us, but I am convinced that all of the measures we have introduced will help.	2005-01-20a.947.2	Does my hon Friend accept that the other side of the tuition fee argument is the restoration by this Government of the student grant? He will have seen yesterday that my constituency sends the fewest youngsters to university of any in the United Kingdom. In a poor constituency such as mine, 60 per cent. of youngsters would qualify for a full grant and an additional 36 per cent. of youngsters for a partial grant. That is the best way to crack the problem of getting young people from deprived backgrounds into higher education.	2005-01-20a.947.1	person/10008	person/10294	False	2005-01-20	blair	False	False	0	Education	Education And Skills	Tuition Fees	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2005-01-20.7.2	I know that we all have problems with language from time to time, but that was speaking with a forked tongue with a vengeance. That lot want to cut the number of teachers and cut public services, and they will do it. Let nobody be taken in by their weasel words of sympathy for teachers and those in education. The Conservatives will cut public services; they always do. They did it in the 1990s and they will do it if they are ever elected again.	2005-01-20a.947.4	This is bad news for our student teachers—fourth-year students who have already run up the costs of three years at university, and who will now see a significant increase in their debt. That means that fewer people will come forward to do those courses. Where will it stop? Will it be radiographers and doctors next? Do the Government plan to remove all the concessions on fees? When will the Government understand that it is our public services and recruitment to teaching and national health service jobs that will suffer from their ill-thought-out policies on fees? I say to all those student teachers who will suffer from this measure that the Conservatives in government will reverse them.	2005-01-20a.947.3	person/10920	person/10294	False	2005-01-20	blair	False	False	0	Education	Education And Skills	Tuition Fees	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2005-01-20.7.3	I can give my hon Friend that assurance, but I must tell him that I do not think that it is a sacrifice to take part in higher education and to invest in one's own future. Frankly, a lot of drivel is talked about that. When people take part in higher education they do so in the good knowledge that it will cost them something, but that it is the best investment they will ever make and that they will be given the best help they are ever likely to get in their lives. We shall keep a close eye on the situation, but we will also ensure that people are not put off either by scaremongering stories or by misconceptions about what entering higher education entails and that they know the good it can do for every individual in the country.	2005-01-20a.948.0	I congratulate my hon Friend on getting angry about that issue; it is vital that we bring more people into teaching. As the balance has changed and more people are coming into teaching through the PGCE route, will he assure me that he will keep an eye on the situation and undertake detailed research so that people are clear about what they are sacrificing by coming into teaching—the balance of funding in terms of the jobs given up as more and more mature students go into teaching and the costs of going into the profession? Will my hon Friend assure me that he intends to undertake that detailed research?	2005-01-20a.947.5	person/10177	person/10294	False	2005-01-20	blair	False	False	0	Education	Education And Skills	Tuition Fees	0	labourco-operative	False	False	labour	True	False
2005-01-20.8.0	"The real issue is that the education policies of the Secretary of State and the Prime Minister are about supporting every child in fulfilling their potential, in stark contrast to the Conservatives when they were in government. Of course, we celebrate the achievements of all schools in this country, but I am disappointed that the hon Gentleman did not focus on the big story that is emerging from our education system: inner-city schools are performing at the levels we have wanted for decades, directly as a result of the Government's investment and reform programme. We shall accelerate that programme, for the development of foundation specialist schools and new city academies and to reform the curriculum and qualifications for 11 to 19-year-olds.
Let us be clear about the dividing line between the two parties on these issues. The Conservatives want to introduce selection at five and reintroduce selection—"	2005-01-20a.948.5	I am grateful to the Minister for confirming that selective areas perform better than comprehensive areas on the value-added measures. In fact, five of the top 10 LEAs use selection. Grammar schools perform much better than comprehensive schools and secondary high schools perform as well as comprehensive schools. Is not it true that for those of us who did not have the advantage of the expensive public school education of the Secretary of State for Education and Skills and the Prime Minister, selective schools and selective education areas offer better results to children throughout the country? Is not it time that the Government dropped their mindless opposition to grammar schools and allowed them to expand in the same way as other good schools?	2005-01-20a.948.4	person/10062	person/10357	True	2005-01-20	blair	False	False	0	Education	Education And Skills	League Tables	1	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2005-01-20.8.1	I agree entirely with my hon Friend. The Government's vision is that parents in every community should have a choice of high-performing, diverse schools and that high standards and high expectations should to be applied to all students, not just a few. That shows the difference of vision between the Labour party and the Conservative party in respect of the education system and the best interests of young people and the knowledge economy.	2005-01-20a.949.2	Is not it true that in a selective system certain values can never be added for the children who fail 11-plus education, because in local authorities that operate selective systems better resources are concentrated in the grammar schools? By that, I mean things such as better science facilities, better science and language laboratories and even better sports facilities.

2005-01-20.9.0	We can end this set of questions with total agreement. I agree with everything that the hon Lady says about the role of parents and schools and about the importance of healthy food in stimulating and supporting children's good development in every sense.	2005-01-20a.949.7	Does the Minister agree that, although the primary responsibility for children's nutrition should lie with parents, that principle should be followed in both primary and secondary education? Is she aware that many primary schools already provide fresh, home-cooked meals that are healthy and nutritious, often with ingredients such as locally sourced meat and fresh vegetables, thus aiding pupils' ability to concentrate and therefore to learn?	2005-01-20a.949.6	person/10646	person/10281	True	2005-01-20	blair	False	False	0	Education	Education And Skills	School Meals	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2005-01-20.10.0	I absolutely agree with everything that my hon Friend has said. We strongly support people's right to express their views, to demonstrate and to protest, but that does not extend to committing criminal offences against perfectly lawful and, indeed, important industries—the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries—and we will protect them in carrying out their lawful and important work against criminal acts.	2005-01-20a.950.6	Is my right hon and learned Friend aware that, in a report published yesterday, the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry listed 177 cases of damage to company, personal and private property and 100 threatening phone calls to companies engaged in animal research? Although we all accept that testing on animals should be carried out only when there is absolutely no alternative, does she agree that it is high time that those thugs and criminals were brought to book? They are terrorising hard-working, sincere people and threatening our science base.	2005-01-20a.950.5	person/10098	person/10260	True	2005-01-20	blair	False	False	0	Attorney General	Solicitor-General	Animal Rights Extremism	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2005-01-20.10.1	The Attorney-General has taken the chair of a national policy forum on animal rights extremist crime that brings together the police, the prosecutors and Departments such as the Department of Trade and Industry, the Treasury and the Home Office, precisely to ensure that we have a national strategy to deal with what the hon Gentleman rightly suggests is highly well-organised, sophisticated crime. It is also important that the Crown Prosecution Service plays its part nationally and that all the areas are involved. Such work is under way, and I entirely agree with the hon Gentleman about the approach that we need to take.	2005-01-20a.950.8	The Solicitor-General knows that those who carry out such acts are extremely adept at working their way around the system, switching from primary to secondary targets often on the fringes of illegality and, sometimes, stepping well over the line. What steps are being taken to ensure a uniformity of approach by Crown prosecutors and, in particular, in the role of special prosecutors in dealing with such activities? I understood that the Government were going to place such things in the hands of special prosecutors, but the evidence that is coming back to us shows that there is still a great deal of patchiness across the country in the way in which those problems are being approached.	2005-01-20a.950.7	person/10243	person/10260	False	2005-01-20	blair	False	False	0	Attorney General	Solicitor-General	Animal Rights Extremism	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2005-01-20.11.0	I agree with my hon Friend that the Crown Prosecution Service needs to be encouraged to work closely with other criminal justice agencies, and beyond that to work with local authorities and engage with local communities. The CPS is of course a member of local criminal justice boards, but the specific pattern of work will depend on each area. The principle exists that it should work closely with others to prevent, as well as prosecute, crime.	2005-01-20a.951.4	Is my right hon and learned Friend aware that the local criminal justice board in North Yorkshire has started working systematically with crime reduction partnerships in the county, including of course the Safer York partnership, to ensure that the work of courts and prosecutors complements and supports the work of other agencies fighting crime? Does she think that encouragement should be given to Crown Prosecution Service officers in all parts of the country to do such work?	2005-01-20a.951.3	person/10029	person/10260	True	2005-01-20	blair	False	False	0	Attorney General	Solicitor-General	Crime Prevention Partnerships	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2005-01-20.11.1	I am afraid that I do not know the answer to the question about the connection between farm watch schemes and the Crown Prosecution Service, but I undertake to find out and get back to the hon Lady. There is obviously close liaison between the CPS and her local criminal justice board because the chief Crown prosecutor chairs that board.	2005-01-20a.951.6	Is the Solicitor-General aware that there is close co-operation between the criminal justice board and Crown Prosecution Service in North Yorkshire, which will be consolidated when they move into joint offices in Clifton Moor in the Vale of York? Will she also pay tribute to the work of not only neighbourhood watches, but farm watches to prevent rural crime in areas throughout North Yorkshire?

2005-01-20.11.2	My hon Friend makes an important point. If people do not have confidence in the criminal justice system, they will not report crimes, give statements, or come to court. If that happens, a prosecution cannot occur, so the perpetrator gets away with the crime and is free to reoffend. A great deal of activity is going on throughout criminal justice agencies and especially in the Crown Prosecution Service to ensure that witnesses are told what is going on and not passed from pillar to post without knowing their position. It should be ensured that witnesses who are intimidated are protected with special measures in addition to police protection, and things should be geared around witnesses, without whom there can be no justice.	2005-01-20a.952.0	My right hon and learned Friend will know that one of the most important elements of bringing a successful prosecution is ensuring that there are witnesses who not only provide an initial statement, but stand in court. We sometimes lose many such witnesses because of intimidation in their local communities or simply because they find the whole justice system difficult. What is the Crown Prosecution Service doing to ensure that more witnesses stand in court?	2005-01-20a.951.7	person/10761	person/10260	False	2005-01-20	blair	False	False	0	Attorney General	Solicitor-General	Crime Prevention Partnerships	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2005-01-20.11.3	I shall ask my office to liaise with that of my hon Friend to get the details of the sentence. As he will be aware, if a sentence is unduly lenient, I can refer it to the Court of Appeal to ask for it to be reviewed, so long as that happens within 28 days. It is possible for me to examine the sentence and take action to reinforce the public's confidence that sentencing levels are appropriate.	2005-01-20a.952.2	Does the Solicitor-General agree that while partnerships need to be in place, justice must be seen to be done? Will she listen to representations that I may make to her about the length of a sentence given to an offender who was found guilty of raping a 12-year-old child? He received only six years for that offence, so will my right hon and learned Friend join me and probably the local Crown Prosecution Service to ensure that that sentence fits the crime more suitably?	2005-01-20a.952.1	person/10463	person/10260	False	2005-01-20	blair	False	False	0	Attorney General	Solicitor-General	Crime Prevention Partnerships	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2005-01-20.12.0	Because of the number of representations that I have received from hon Members on both sides of the House, I am aware that antisocial behaviour and the need to respond to it are problems in almost every constituency. My hon Friend knows that her city, Cardiff, has a specific antisocial behaviour prosecutor who specialises in such work, and the number of specialist prosecutors will no doubt be expanded as their work develops. I thank her for her comments on the specialist domestic violence prosecutor in her area, who does a marvellous job, and I want to place on record my thanks to the specialist prosecutors for their work.	2005-01-20a.953.0	What plans does my right hon Friend have to increase the number of specialist prosecutors for antisocial behaviour? In south Wales, we have experienced the benefits of having a successful specialist prosecutor for domestic violence. I welcome the fact that we now have a special prosecutor for antisocial behaviour, particularly in view of the large amount of antisocial behaviour that has recently been occurring in my constituency.	2005-01-20a.952.6	person/10442	person/10260	True	2005-01-20	blair	False	False	0	Attorney General	Solicitor-General	Crown Prosecution Service	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2005-01-20.12.1	I agree with the hon Gentleman that fraud is an area of criminality that must be taken seriously. Fairness should exist across the criminal justice system, and one should not be less likely to be prosecuted because one has committed a white collar crime. The Serious Fraud Office has specialist prosecutors who deal with fraud, and the headquarters of the CPS also has specialist fraud prosecutors. Specialist fraud prosecutors are not used in every area, and I recognise the concern that greater co-ordination should occur between police and prosecutors in that area, which is often difficult and technical. The Attorney-General and I refer unduly lenient fraud sentences to the Court of Appeal, because we want the public to be sure that people do not get off lightly just because they are city business men.	2005-01-20a.954.0	The CPS areas have no specialist fraud prosecutors, and the de minimis level at which the Serious Fraud Office investigates and a possible prosecution occurs is very high. White collar crime is not getting the attention that it deserves from the CPS. Will the Solicitor-General ensure that specialist fraud prosecutors are included in each CPS area?	2005-01-20a.953.1	person/10078	person/10260	False	2005-01-20	blair	False	False	0	Attorney General	Solicitor-General	Crown Prosecution Service	0	liberal-democrat	False	False	labour	True	False
1997-10-29.0.0	I thank my hon Friend for that question and for her kind comments. The achievement has been the work of many people over the past six months. In the end, it is the Northern Ireland political parties that will make a difference in Northern Ireland and that will make progress or not. In previous months, they have shown, across the board, much courage in getting us to where we are. I do not have any intention of changing the make-up of the Parades Commission. I should like to take this opportunity to thank Alistair Graham and his colleagues for the good job that they have done. Up to now, they have been doing their job with one hand tied behind their backs. With the legislation that is in the other place, we are giving the commission the powers that were recommended for it in the North report. That will enable it to carry out its role as North envisaged. It is now up to both sides to work with the commission to try to reach the most peaceful solution to the parades issue in the next year. In the end, accommodation is the best way forward and accommodation will be reached by people working hand in hand with the commission.	1997-10-29a.883.7	I congratulate my right hon Friend on her fine record of achievement in just six months as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. As the current Parades Commission membership has been open to criticism, or been criticised, by some people on both sides of the community, will my right hon Friend review its membership?	1997-10-29a.883.6	person/10135	person/10449	True	1997-10-29	blair	False	False	0	Northern Ireland	Northern Ireland	Parades	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
1997-10-29.0.1	"Drumcree, in the end, is part of a broader issue. To deal with the Drumcrees,we will have

to try to find mechanisms to build confidence between the two communities and to build greater trust and respect. The Parades Commission has been set up to try to address issues such as Drumcree: the commission will be able to consider individual parades and to determine an outcome, taking into account both the rights of people to march and their responsibilities towards the rights of others to be free from fear and intimidation. The Bill is not anti-marching, but is an attempt to accommodate the two sides of the community in terms of reaching an accommodation that they can both live with. In the end, if we get to the determinant powers that the Bill will give to the Parades Commission, we shall have failed to reach an accommodation, which is the best way to move forward. The Parades Commission will be ready to do that in the months ahead when the legislation has passed through the House."	1997-10-29a.883.9	I endorse the comments by my hon Friend the Member for Bristol, East (Ms Corston). What impact will the legislation that my right hon Friend has introduced have on more contentious parades such as Drumcree?	1997-10-29a.883.8	person/10529	person/10449	True	1997-10-29	blair	False	False	0	Northern Ireland	Northern Ireland	Parades	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
1997-10-29.0.2	I obviously disagree with much of what the hon Gentleman says. There is no hidden agenda; there is just a straightforward attempt to listen to all sides after Drumcree last year. We said after that situation that we were committed to bringing in the Parades Commission and its statutory powers, and we said that we would listen to people. I listened to the hon Gentleman's party, to Church groups and to parties across the board and tried to respond positively to all of them. In terms of the Bellaghy issue, I was with the Guides the day before yesterday. We will treat all situations in a fair and open fashion. Part of the object of the Parades Commission is to let people see the open, transparent process that will be followed to reach a determination. It is important for people to remember that the commission is not anti one side or the other; it is trying to assist with an accommodation and to reach a conclusion about parades next year so that people do not have to live through the violence that has occurred previously.	1997-10-29a.884.1	Does the Secretary of State have no second thoughts about her capitulation to the IRA-inspired and orchestrated pressure over the parades issue? Is not the truth the prediction of Dublin journalist and writer Ruth Dudley-Edwards, who suggested that, if the Orange Order sought to accommodate on this issue, pressure would be applied to the Royal British Legion and then to the Girls Brigade? Has Bellaghy not proved Ruth Dudley-Edwards to be correct? Does the Secretary of State intend that further capitulation on the Bellaghy issue will be, in effect, another tranche of the danegeld that she is obliged to pay to keep the IRA at the table of democracy?	1997-10-29a.884.0	person/10406	person/10449	False	1997-10-29	blair	False	False	0	Northern Ireland	Northern Ireland	Parades	0	uup	False	False	labour	True	False

The Parades Commission has a broad set of criteria on which to reach conclusions. They take into account a host of recommendations and are not just limited as they have been in previous years. In that sense, I hope that the full statutory powers that the commission will be given if the legislation is passed through both Houses will provide broader criteria on which to reach a conclusion which, we hope, will be acceptable to more people."	1997-10-29a.884.3	Does the Secretary of State agree that marches and parades that give offence, deny the rights of others and inject sectarian venom into the community should derive no credit or advantage from the fact that they are traditional and have traditionally poisoned relationships within Northern Ireland?

1997-10-29.0.4	I will answer the question in relation to Jason Campbell. I apologise for any upset or hurt that was caused to the Scott family. I am sorry if it caused them any deeper pain than they already felt. Jason Campbell claimed family ties in Northern Ireland. Like the previous Government, we have followed the policy of transferring prisoners closer to their families. The Conservative Government did that previously and we have continued to do that. It subsequently became clear that the claims that Jason Campbell had made were false. The decision was then corrected and the transfer was refused. I believe that that was a correct decision. However, in line with the European convention, the Government remain committed to the principle of, where possible, transferring sentenced prisoners to places closer to their families.	1997-10-29a.885.1	Surely the best way to reduce tensions, both in respect of parades and elsewhere in the Province, would be for the Secretary of State to state categorically today that we have absolutely no political prisoners in this country and that she will never again do the sort of shabby deal that she did with David Irvine of the Progressive Unionists, which would have led to a very evil murderer in Jason Campbell leaving prison in Scotland and going to the Province.

1997-10-29.1.0	I made it clear in response to an earlier question that we would continue to transfer prisoners closer to their families because that was in the best interests of the judicial system. This is one of the many issues that have been raised during the talks process and, in considering it, we must also take into account broader questions, such as the pain and suffering felt by the friends and families of those who have been killed. We made announcements last week on exactly that point. We shall continue to consider the merits of each case separately, as we have done up to now.	1997-10-29a.886.1	I congratulate my right hon Friend on her work in getting the talks under way and her preparedness to meet all parties in Northern Ireland as a way of furthering the peace process. Does she agree that it is important to keep the peace process on track and to keep confidence-building measures going? My right hon Friend has already mentioned the transfer of prisoners, but will she enlighten the House further on whether more prisoners will be transferred, either to Northern Ireland or to the Republic, as is appropriate? Does she recognise that maintaining prisoners in Britain is often as much a punishment on their families as it is on the individuals themselves, and that transfers are an important part of building confidence in the peace process?	1997-10-29a.886.0	person/10133	person/10449	True	1997-10-29	blair	False	False	0	Northern Ireland	Northern Ireland	Peace Process	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
1997-10-29.1.1	May is the date for which we are aiming to reach an accommodation that can be put to the people of Northern Ireland—the final guarantee in the basic principle that guides us is consent: that no decision that comes out of the talks will be acted on until the people of Northern Ireland, the majority of them, have stated their views. I agree with my hon Friend that the Northern Ireland Women's Coalition has been a positive force in the talks process. When I turn around and see so many women in the House, I look forward to seeing more women in the political process in Northern Ireland. However, only the actions of all the parties in the talks process, together, reaching an accommodation, will move the process forward. Our wishes must be that the parties must accommodate and work together, otherwise the progress that we would all like to see will not happen.	1997-10-29a.886.3	People in Glasgow will very much welcome my right hon Friend's comments on Jason Campbell. Will she join me in congratulating the Northern Ireland Women's Coalition on its constructive role in the talks? Attitudes such as it brings forward will help the talks move towards a successful conclusion by, we all hope, May next year.	1997-10-29a.886.2	person/10215	person/10449	True	1997-10-29	blair	False	False	0	Northern Ireland	Northern Ireland	Peace Process	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

Ireland hon Members have their own views on the public mood, the first thing that people say to me when I talk to them is, ""Please continue; we must have peace."" The second thing that they say is, ""Jobs—jobs will make the difference."" Those are the two overwhelming messages that one receives. Sometimes, the questions asked in the various polls—although we could quote the Belfast Telegraph poll versus the News Letter poll and reach different conclusions, as I am sure that hon Members on both sides of the House would like to do—produce responses that reveal the amount of fear and distrust in the communities. One can ask any set of questions and discover the fear that people feel. It is therefore up to all those involved in the process to try to build the trust and confidence that ultimately will produce the respect that will move the process further."	1997-10-29a.886.5	May I add my congratulations and express my gratitude to my right hon Friend and—as she said—her team for their sterling work over the summer recess? Will she use this occasion to enlighten the House on the public's mood and response to the all-party talks? We have heard much about what the parties, politicians and media have to say of events in Northern Ireland, but how have the public reacted to the work that has been done over the recess?	1997-10-29a.886.4	person/10117	person/10449	True	1997-10-29	blair	False	False	0	Northern Ireland	Northern Ireland	Peace Process	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
1997-10-29.1.3	I thank my hon Friend for his question, and I agree with every word of it.	1997-10-29a.887.1	Does my right hon Friend accept that the people of Britain and of Ireland are united in wanting the process in Northern Ireland to work and in wishing the people of Northern Ireland well? Does she also accept that the people of Britain and of Ireland greatly admire the efforts made in recent months by her and her team? Both in Britain and in Ireland, however, we also expect something. We expect a very high standard of political leadership in the north—from both Unionist and republican leaders—which, sadly, has sometimes been missing. It seems that a real effort is now being made by both sides, and everyone in the two islands wants to help those leaders in the negotiations—which, preferably, will be finished by 1 May 1998. It is a hard deadline, but it is a goal that they could achieve. They will receive all our support and acclamation if they do so.	1997-10-29a.887.0	person/10556	person/10449	True	1997-10-29	blair	False	False	0	Northern Ireland	Northern Ireland	Peace Process	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
1997-10-29.1.4	I thank the hon Gentleman for his question. Yesterday, I met Army representatives, and they did not mention that point to me. However, that does not mean that the decision was not very difficult, and I do not want in any way to underestimate the matter. As the hon Gentleman knows, the matter came across my desk because the previous Government decided to move up the review by the Life Sentence Review Board from 10 to five years. In those circumstances, I examined the case—as it is my job to do—and I made a judgment in the round, based on the conditions that I was faced with. I decided that, for deterrence and retribution for the murder, it was necessary for them to serve six years before the case was again reviewed. I made that decision only because of the role that I must play in such cases.	1997-10-29a.887.3	As the Government believe that confidence-building measures have a part to play in the process, and as those measures include prisoner issues, whose confidence was the Secretary of State trying to build in her recent decision on the case of Guardsmen Fisher and Wright? Is she aware of the anger and resentment that that decision has caused, and that it has undermined the Army's confidence in her?	1997-10-29a.887.2	person/10301	person/10449	False	1997-10-29	blair	False	False	0	Northern Ireland	Northern Ireland	Peace Process	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
1997-10-29.1.5	I begin by condemning the Loyalist Volunteer Force threat to the Irish and the British working at the Anglo-Irish secretariat at Maryfield and I am sure that all hon Members will join me in doing that. I understand the Unionists' deep concern about the issue and we have discussed it with the Unionist parties. We are committed to openness and transparency. I have reassured the hon Gentleman and others that we are looking at ways of making things more open, as we are in response to letters from the public in terms of making the talks more open. The difficulty is that, when trying to reach agreements, it is sometimes difficult to put things into the public domain immediately. However, I take the hon Gentleman's point and we will be as open as we can. I disagree with the hon Gentleman's statement that there is underhand activity taking place. There is not. I have said clearly today that there is no hidden agenda. I can assure hon Members that we will continue to talk and work with the Irish because history has shown that, when the British and Irish Governments work together, more progress can be made.	1997-10-29a.888.0	"Given the Secretary of State's commitment to building confidence, does she share with me the deep concern felt in the Unionist community about the memorandums that were leaked, emanating from the

Anglo-Irish secretariat at Maryfield? Does she agree that it shows the secrecy and underhanded dealing in the Government's approach to Northern Ireland? Given the Government's commitment to open government, is it not time that the Maryfield secretariat was closed? Would not its closure do an enormous amount to build confidence in the Unionist community that the Government are even-handed in their approach to Northern Ireland?"	1997-10-29a.887.4	person/10172	person/10449	False	1997-10-29	blair	False	False	0	Northern Ireland	Northern Ireland	Peace Process	0	uup	False	False	labour	True	False
1997-10-29.1.6	I thank the hon Gentleman for his question. We have made it clear on numerous occasions that we would like to see some decommissioning during the talks, in line with the Mitchell report. In case there is any doubt among hon Members, that is the same position as the previous Government. I pay tribute to General de Chastelain and his colleagues for their work towards that end in the decommissioning commission. In answer to the hon Gentleman's question, I can tell the House today that the commission has now presented its initial report to the two Governments. Both Governments have started to consider that report today and I envisage that it will shortly be submitted to the decommissioning sub-committee in the talks. Unfortunately, the hon Gentleman will not be there at the talks to read that. I hope that the hon Gentleman and the United Kingdom Unionist party have a chance to reconsider their position, because their voice would mean so much more if it was heard at the talks.	1997-10-29a.888.2	Would the Secretary of State care to catalogue for the House the amount of illegal weaponry that has so far been decommissioned under the Government's scheme? Would she care to tell the House what the Government understand to be the intention of each of the paramilitary organisations in relation to decommissioning their illegal weaponry?	1997-10-29a.888.1	person/10507	person/10449	False	1997-10-29	blair	False	False	0	Northern Ireland	Northern Ireland	Peace Process	0	dup	False	False	labour	True	False
1997-10-29.1.7	I thank the hon and learned Gentleman for his question. As the House knows, numerous views have been expressed about the desired outcome of the process. Some want a united Ireland and some want the present situation of the Union to continue. We have said that all options are on the table. It is important to remember that consent is the guiding principle of this Government in the process. Without the consent of the people, nothing will change. As the hon and learned Gentleman knows, in the talks process decisions are taken by sufficient consensus, which means that we need a majority of both communities represented by parties in the talks process for any decision to be reached. Above that, any decision that eventually comes out of the process will go to the people of Northern Ireland for a vote in a referendum. It is the majority vote in a referendum that will count. That is consent in practice. From the hon and learned Gentleman's perspective, that is a guarantee which means that, if one participates in the talks, an accommodation can be reached with which, we hope, both communities can live.	1997-10-29a.889.0	"Is the Secretary of State aware that her counterpart in the Irish Government, Mr. David Andrews, declared yesterday that the future of the Union was on the table for negotiation and that the representatives of Sinn Fein-IRA have stated that their purpose in the talks is to smash the Union? Is it the


Government's policy to secure and strengthen the Union or to go along with the expressed views of those two participants?"	1997-10-29a.888.3	person/10380	person/10449	False	1997-10-29	blair	False	False	0	Northern Ireland	Northern Ireland	Peace Process	0	ukup	False	False	labour	True	False
1997-10-29.1.8	I thank the hon Gentleman for that question. I have made it clear on numerous occasions that there will be no change in Northern Ireland without consent being the guiding principle and without the triple lock and the referendum. I can give the hon Gentleman an absolute guarantee. I do not disown the article, for the simple reason that what I was trying to express, and what I obviously expressed badly because of the furore that followed, is that my aim in the talks process is to build a level of consent that is more than just a simple majority on one side. I want a greater level of consensus and consent from the community so that we have a real chance to make the decisions that are reached work.	1997-10-29a.889.2	That answer was welcome, because the Secretary of State will be aware that, after her interview with Mr. McCartan in the Belfast Telegraph on 28 August, there was real worry in the Province that when she said that consent was not necessarily even numerical or geographic it meant that there was some sliding from the previously announced policy that the consent of the people of Northern Ireland was the only one that counted.

In addition, the detailed suggestions from across the entire community in Northern Ireland have proved to be exceptionally helpful to my right hon Friend the Secretary of State in her review.	1997-10-29a.890.1	What benefits does my hon Friend believe that his extensive consultation process has had for his assessment of Northern Ireland's overall spending needs and priorities?	1997-10-29a.890.0	<UNKNOWN>	person/10454	True	1997-10-29	blair	False	False	2	Northern Ireland	Northern Ireland	Comprehensive Spending Review	0				labour	True	False

Will he comment on the fact that, unfortunately, the current negotiations are continuing against a background in which Sinn Fein has not demanded that the IRA should give up its illegally held weapons and decommission has not already started?

Given that Northern Ireland already has a computerised database for cattle tracing and that such a system was a requirement of the veterinary advisory committee to the Commission for the implementation of a certified herds scheme, is it the Government's intention to seek a lifting of the export ban through a certified herds system for beef from Northern Ireland, as opposed to beef from the rest of the United Kingdom, and in advance of a system for the rest of the United Kingdom?	1997-10-29a.891.6	person/10470	person/10653	True	1997-10-29	blair	False	False	0	Northern Ireland	Northern Ireland	Beef Industry	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
1997-10-29.4.0	I agree with my hon Friend. I believe that we can build a national consensus behind the position that the Government set out on Monday. That position is: if it is successful and the economic benefits are clear and unambiguous, Britain should be part of a single currency; it is not realistic to join during this Parliament, but we should prepare now to be able to join early in the next Parliament if the single currency works and those economic tests are fulfilled. I am delighted that the former Chancellor—whatever his desire to move more quickly—can see the need to join across political parties and put a clear position to the country, because it is the national interest, not Conservative party divisions, that should determine the issue.	1997-10-29a.892.0	"Will my right hon Friend join me in welcoming the fact that, in the former Chancellor, there

1997-10-29.4.2	My hon Friend is absolutely right: today's allocations amount, over this year and the next year, to more than £1.5 billion more for the health service under a Labour Government than under the Conservative spending plans. We shall also invite every health authority and council in England to bid to become one of the new health action zones, which will work through joint management of budgets and one-stop health centres. The zones will bring together the professionals—general practitioners, pharmacists, community nurses, social workers and others—and the idea is that they will be able to find fresh, better ways of delivering health service care for the future. We are not only putting in the extra investment that our health service needs—far in excess of that which would have been put in by the Conservatives—but modernising and improving the health service.	1997-10-29a.894.0	"I welcome today's announcement of additional funding for the national health service.

That is precisely why we have set out the very clear statement that the Chancellor made on Monday—so that we have a framework in which we can move forward in future.	1997-10-29a.894.2	I will ask a question about monetary union. Is not the significance of the statement made by the Chancellor on Monday not as much its time scale as its clear and unequivocal expression of support in principle for the single currency and for Britain's joining it? The Prime Minister believes that the Government will take that decision later rather than earlier. I think he is wrong; I think it will come at him much faster then he believes. He may believe that the decision, to be driven by the national interest, may be taken after the next general election, but will he at least admit that if it is in the national interest for it to be taken earlier, there is nothing to prevent that happening?	1997-10-29a.894.1	person/10015	person/10047	False	1997-10-29	blair	True	False	2	Prime Minister	Prime Minister	Engagements	0	liberal-democrat	False	False	labour	True	False

Secondly, may I tell him that I would have been delighted to answer the constitutional issues if they had been put to me by the Leader of the Opposition—as we were told on the lunchtime news they would be? The answer is very simple. Of course constitutional issues are at stake, but in the end the question is whether they operate as a constitutional bar to joining if the economic benefits are clear and unambiguous. Our answer to that is that there is no constitutional bar. What is the Opposition's answer?	1997-10-29a.895.1	On Monday, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, disgracefully, refused to address the political and constitutional implications of the single currency. Does the Prime Minister agree that the British people deserve an explanation of those constitutional political implications in principle?

In relation to the bigger issue of drug abuse, the Government already have an independent statutory adviser in the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs. Secondly, we appointed recently an anti-drugs co-ordinator, Keith Hellawell, a former chief constable, who will formulate, with the Government, a strategy to combat drug misuse.

The Fireworks Bill that is to be introduced by my hon Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Mrs. Gilroy) will provide the Government with the capability to deal with a number of fireworks issues that are outside the scope of present regulations.

If he agrees with that proposition, what does he say to the British Medical Association, which has strongly criticised his proposals on tuition fees for those embarking on six-year medical courses, as the BMA believes that tuition fees will discourage many people from offering themselves for training as doctors?	1997-10-29a.897.4	person/10307	person/10047	False	1997-10-29	blair	True	False	0	Prime Minister	Prime Minister	Engagements	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
1997-10-29.4.12	My hon Friend is right. We have made clear our commitment to a complete ban on anti-personnel land mines. We are banning them in the UK and we intend to sign the Ottawa convention in December banning them internationally. We accept that not all users of land mines will sign the Ottawa convention, but we will encourage them to do so and look for other ways in which to engage all states in a global ban. That is long overdue, it is right and it has the overwhelming support of the public, not only in Britain but throughout the world, and we shall play our full part in bringing it about.	1997-10-29a.898.1	Did my right hon Friend notice that in yesterday's debate the Conservative spokesman on defence, the hon Member for Salisbury (Mr. Key), said that anti-personnel land mines saved lives? Will my right hon Friend take this opportunity to reassert that the Government's policy is to save lives by getting rid of land mines, not finding excuses for them?	1997-10-29a.898.0	person/10478	person/10047	False	1997-10-29	blair	True	False	0	Prime Minister	Prime Minister	Engagements	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
1997-10-29.4.13	Of course we shall consider carefully all the points raised by the hon Gentleman. I know that he met Lord Dubs, the Minister responsible for environment and agriculture in the Northern Ireland Office, on 11 September to promote the case for funding the project. It was made clear at that meeting that the Government are enormously constrained in funding terms as to what we can provide. However, as we promised at the meeting, officials from the Department of the Environment and Agriculture are today meeting Larne borough council to consider how best the council might advance the project. We support the project, but we must try to do so within public finance constraints.	1997-10-29a.898.3	Will the Prime Minister and the Government consider urgently what financial assistance they may give Larne borough council in my constituency, which has been offered £2.5 million by the Millennium Commission to develop a spectacular sea cliff path at the Gobbins in Islandmagee? Matching funding of £2.5 million would impose too big a burden on local ratepayers and we may lose the opportunity to develop a national tourist attraction. Can the Prime Minister help to bring together central Government and local government so that we maximise the benefit of millennium funding?	1997-10-29a.898.2	person/10033	person/10047	False	1997-10-29	blair	True	False	0	Prime Minister	Prime Minister	Engagements	0	uup	False	False	labour	True	False
1997-10-29.4.14	My hon Friend is absolutely right: I welcome very much the initiative taken by the Secretary of State, who is in Oslo today attending a conference on child labour. I also welcome the fact that FIFA has got behind the initiative. As a result of the funded initiative that the Government have announced, we hope to help some 7,000 children move from bonded labour to proper education and skills training. This is a problem not just in Pakistan but throughout the developing world, and we shall do everything we can to build on and advance the initiative. I think that it will have the support of the vast majority of people.	1997-10-29a.899.0	Is my right hon Friend aware that many of the footballs that British kids play with are made in Sialkot in Pakistan by other children—many of them as young as five or six—who work as bonded labour in sweated conditions for as little as lop an hour? Will he do all he can to ensure that the brave initiative taken by the Secretary of State for International Development and FIFA to bring an end to that abuse is carried through as quickly as possible and is extended to other industries that use sweated labour to produce sporting goods for the British market?	1997-10-29a.898.4	person/10436	person/10047	False	1997-10-29	blair	True	False	0	Prime Minister	Prime Minister	Engagements	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
1997-10-29.4.15	The hon Gentleman forgets that the Government he supported introduced the cut. The Secretary of State made it absolutely clear, before and after the election, that we must keep within the tough spending guidelines we set out because of the mess that we inherited from the previous Government. However, we have introduced a very important £200 million programme for single parents. I suggest that the hon Gentleman take up the cut with those who introduced it: the previous Conservative Government.	1997-10-29a.899.2	Can the Prime Minister explain why the Secretary of State for Social Security said in January that she would not implement any cuts in single parent benefit and yet, only a few weeks after the general election, introduced legislation that will cut single parent benefit?

1997-10-29.4.16	I agree. My hon Friend will know that the Home Secretary gave his full support today to extending that scheme. It is part of a series of measures that are being taken to tighten the juvenile justice system and part of a system to ensure that final warnings are given to young people so that they know exactly where they stand. It is also part of our proposals to halve the time it takes to bring juvenile offenders to court to be dealt with and properly punished. It is one of a series of measures that allow us to address the causes of crime through better employment and skills training for young people and to ensure that those who commit crimes and terrorise people are dealt with properly and firmly through the criminal justice system.	1997-10-29a.899.4	My right hon Friend may be aware that in my Milton Keynes constituency a project of reparative youth justice has been in operation for some time. It has demonstrated considerable success in getting young people and their parents to face responsibility for their crimes and cut the rate of reoffending. Does my right hon Friend agree that it is imperative that the Home Secretary's proposals to extend that sort of approach to youth justice nationwide are implemented as soon as possible?	1997-10-29a.899.3	person/10564	person/10047	False	1997-10-29	blair	True	False	0	Prime Minister	Prime Minister	Engagements	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

If he visited my constituency, he would discover one of the finest conference and exhibition businesses in the United Kingdom, which is wholly public sector-owned by the local authority. To protect some 5,000 jobs and more than 300 businesses, we need to build a new exhibition hall, but without trading credit approvals—which is the best way to secure finance for such local government development—those jobs cannot be protected.

Is he aware that the coal contracts come up for re-signing in the spring and that if there is not a satisfactory agreement several pits could close?

We estimate, however, that in the intermediate range alone the Soviet Union possesses 351 SS20 missiles with 1,053 warheads, and that approximately two thirds of these face western Europe, together with about 250 warheads on the older SS4 and SS5 missiles."	1983-03-29a.164.4	person/10276	person/10099	False	1983-03-29	thatcher	False	False	1	Defence	Defence	Nuclear Weapons	1	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

1983-03-29.9.0	I can give my hon Friend that assurance. I am happy to tell him that eight further countries have adhered to the treaty since 1978. The treaty states in article 6 that the parties to it must make their best efforts to secure multilateral nuclear and other disarmament. That is why it is important to support the proposals that President Reagan has made in the INF context and the START negotiations.	1983-03-29a.175.4	Since the dangers of nuclear proliferation are obvious, does my hon Friend agree that wider adherence to the treaty can best be achieved if it is clear that every effort is being made by the nuclear powers to obtain multilateral, mutually balanced disarmament? As important talks are taking place in Geneva between the United States and the Soviet Union, can my hon Friend assure the House that the British Government are making every effort to seek wider support for the treaty?	1983-03-29a.175.3	person/18184	person/16684	True	1983-03-29	thatcher	False	False	0	Defence	Defence	Non-Proliferation Treaty	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

It is the subject of close consultation between the Governments.	1983-03-29a.176.4	Will the Government urge President Reagan to introduce into the INF negotiations the flexibility that was envisaged in 1979 at the time of the dual track decision—a linkage between intermediate missiles and strategic missiles? Without that flexibility we shall not be able to achieve satisfactory negotiations. The rigidity of trading off only SS20s against cruise and Pershing is the obstacle.	1983-03-29a.176.3	person/21725	person/10276	False	1983-03-29	thatcher	False	False	0	Defence	Defence	Cruise Missiles	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

It would be far better if the hon Gentleman directed his attention to the Soviet Union and asked it to reduce its missiles to nil.

2004-01-26.0.0	My hon Friend is right—the White Paper does mention the conversion of two brigades to medium and light structures.

Some of my constituents, however—particularly those at the Bovington armour centre and the gunnery ranges in Lulworth—are concerned about it, given the conversion of one of the heavy armoured regiments to a light armoured regiment.

The Ministry of Defence is one of the largest training organisations in the United Kingdom and it is important to maximise the return on the investment that we make in our people. One of the ways in which we have been able to do that is through Skillforce, which uses those who leave our armed forces to educate and train youngsters in 23 pilot areas throughout the United Kingdom who would otherwise not get such support for their education.	2004-01-26.4.8	I am grateful for that reply, but will the Minister explain to the House what progress is being made to make training, skills and qualifications earned in the armed forces match more closely those that would be earned in civilian life, so that when the time comes people have a smooth and easy transfer back to civilian life?	2004-01-26.4.7	person/10209	person/10093	True	2004-01-26	blair	False	False	0	Defence	Defence	Armed Forces Education And Training	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

""Although overall protection against chemical agents was good""
there were shortfalls. That is precisely the position that the Government have set out consistently since the operation began. The conclusion was, however, that the overall protection against chemical agents was good. The hon Gentleman has to explain how it is, given that conclusion by the NAO, that he persists in misrepresenting the position for a great majority of soldiers.
He knows, or he should know from his experience as a Minister and, indeed, in the armed forces, that provided that individuals are issued with appropriate kit, which was the position, that is satisfactory protection against an NBC threat."	2004-01-26.7.1	"While the whole House will wish to congratulate the armed forces on their brilliant performance in Iraq, does the Secretary of State agree, given that the principal reason for going to war in the first place was to rid that country of chemical weapons and weapons of mass destruction, that it is extraordinary to find at figure 6 of part 3 of the National Audit Office report that the NAO inspectors discovered that the
""7 Armoured Brigade armoured vehicles did not have viable Nuclear Biological and Chemical defence filters fitted throughout the warfighting phase of the Operation.""?

2004-01-26.3.4	I will not trouble the House with a long list of the statements that I have made about those issues. Suffice it to say that on 14 May last year, some two weeks after the end of combat operations in Iraq, I made it clear that there were bound to be shortcomings in the issuing of equipment but that, overall, operations had been a remarkable success. I repeated that in Defence questions in September, and I said the same sort of thing again in December. That is borne out by both the MOD's lessons learned document and the independent NAO report. That is an absolutely consistent picture. We are not saying that there were not difficulties; we are saying that, overall, it was an outstanding logistic and military success.	2004-01-26.8.2	Is my right hon Friend aware that, notwithstanding the fact that I voted against the Falklands war, the Iraq war twice and all the rest of them, I find it preposterous that people such as the hon Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames) should talk about the Secretary of State for Defence being responsible for every single death while there is a war on? If that had been the case in the past, Churchill would have been hung, drawn and quartered in 1915, Thatcher would have been a figment of everybody's imagination—	2004-01-26.7.4	person/10544	person/10286	False	2004-01-26	blair	False	False	0	Defence	Defence	Iraq	2	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2004-01-26.3.5	My hon Friend is right to emphasise the successes that have been achieved. Equally, I recognise that one lesson, for example, that we must learn is how we improve the in-theatre asset-tracking system. That was part of the reason for not being able to identify the precise location of a small amount of the equipment that was in theatre but could not reach front-line forces in time.	2004-01-26.8.4	This Government have appointed a Chief of Defence Logistics and implemented a total assets visibility project. If that project and a senior member of the armed forces had not put together an effective structure and process for the deployment and use of equipment, what else should we have been doing?	2004-01-26.8.3	person/10585	person/10286	False	2004-01-26	blair	False	False	0	Defence	Defence	Iraq	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2004-01-26.4.0	The hon Gentleman will be well aware that both bids contain significant benefits for UK industry. There are winners and losers in any competition, but our decision has been based on the bid that we judge offers the best potential solution for the armed forces, for the taxpayer and for UK industry.	2004-01-26.9.1	I thank the Minister for that response, but the news that he announced this morning will have come as a great disappointment to Smiths Aerospace in my constituency, which would have liked to add the UK tanker programme to the technology already selected for the United States, Italy and Japan. Where does the news leave British industry's confidence in the much-vaunted MOD defence industrial policy, and what reciprocal arrangements does the right hon Gentleman have with the French as a result of his strengthening the position of EADS and Thales in the UK?	2004-01-26.9.0	person/10505	person/10286	True	2004-01-26	blair	False	False	0	Defence	Defence	Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2004-01-26.4.1	Some people are never satisfied, but I am grateful to my hon Friend for his observations on the high-tech aspect of the bid. As I said in response to the hon Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson) , the project offers significant opportunities for British and British-based industries and for the development of technology in this country.	2004-01-26.9.3	I warmly welcome my right hon Friend's announcement this morning. One of the potential partners for Airbus is IBM, which will produce some of the software for the project based in Greenock in my constituency. Does that not demonstrate that throughout Britain we have the technological capacity to fulfil very high-spec orders? If he could see his way clear to giving us a little of the aircraft carrier orders as well, we would be very happy indeed.	2004-01-26.9.2	person/10775	person/10286	False	2004-01-26	blair	False	False	0	Defence	Defence	Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2004-01-26.4.2	The hon Gentleman, as ever, spoiled quite a good first point with a rambling observation in the second part—an observation that he knows is inaccurate. Eighty-seven per cent. of the criticisms of major projects concerned four projects that were begun under a Conservative Government—four projects that were begun without the benefit of smart procurement. If the hon Gentleman had read the report instead of making slogans, he would have seen that the smart procurement aspect was welcomed by the NAO. It is the difficulty with the four projects started under a Conservative Government that has caused the major backlog. I am in no way complacent about those projects—we have to get them right. However, perhaps he did not read too carefully the statement I made this morning about the future strategic tanker aircraft, in which I indicated that it was a PFI project. The negotiations that we are now taking forward with Air Tanker are to establish the precise details of the PFI aspect.	2004-01-26.9.5	We welcome the decision to replace the ageing VC10s and Tristars, which have done stalwart service for the Royal Air Force, but the Minister's statement today leaves several questions open. What are the outstanding issues referred to in his statement? What assessment has he made of the export potential of the A330 tankers, given that other air forces have bought 767 tankers? Why has he not yet decided to go down the private finance initiative route? Given the last-minute switch last summer of the Hawk 128 order from a PFI to a straight purchase, and last week's disastrous National Audit Office report that the procurement budget was £3,000 million overspent last year, the Government's smart acquisition programme is looking more foolish than smart.	2004-01-26.9.4	person/10293	person/10286	False	2004-01-26	blair	False	False	0	Defence	Defence	Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2004-01-26.4.3	I am grateful to my hon Friend. Often, shipbuilding is associated with Scotland and the north-east, and aircraft manufacturing with north Wales and the north-west, but in reality the benefits of such major contracts spread throughout the UK's manufacturing base. I am especially pleased that the west midlands will reap some of those benefits.	2004-01-26.10.1	Is my hon Friend aware that although some will be disappointed by the Air Tanker decision, the west midlands manufacturing supply chain will not be? In the past three years, many of the companies in question have diversified out of the automotive sector and into aerospace. The announcement is good news not only for north Wales and Scotland, but for the west midlands. Will he get his Department to highlight some of the initiatives for British manufacturing that are giving the west midlands a chance?	2004-01-26.10.0	person/11309	person/10286	False	2004-01-26	blair	False	False	0	Defence	Defence	Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2004-01-26.5.0	We are already working with the private sector where possible, but we would certainly like to investigate further the opportunity to develop training links between the Ministry of Defence and the private sector.	2004-01-26.10.6	I thank my hon Friend for his response. The Department should be congratulated on the fact that many servicemen and women are benefiting from modern apprenticeships. However, does he accept that there is little opportunity at present for the training of apprentices in private industry, so would he consider using MoD facilities to give private industry the opportunity to benefit from those training services?	2004-01-26.10.5	person/10671	person/10093	True	2004-01-26	blair	False	False	0	Defence	Defence	Modern Apprenticeships	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

2004-01-26.6.0	The right hon Gentleman made a valid point in the second part of his question. Maintenance, repair and upgrade facilities are clearly an important feature of any major procurement process in the aerospace sector, and are something that we are keen to develop. Clearly, however, as he rightly pointed out, that has to be done in consultation with our US partners and other members of the consortium. As for access to technology, those talks are continuing. I am sure that he will understand the sensitivity of those talks from the US perspective, but our close relationship with the US as a key international partner stands us in very good stead for making progress on that front.	2004-01-26.11.5	I thank the Minister for his answer, but can he identify what progress, if any, he is making with the United States to ensure that it will participate fully in the technology transfer to make the discussions to which he has just referred meaningful? Can he update the House on what is happening in the consortium of four major British aerospace companies which, I understand, is currently working on proposals dealing with, if nothing else, the maintenance and repair aspects of the JSF operation? He will know that if we can win those contracts, tens of thousands of jobs, given updates on the project, could be available for UK aerospace workers.	2004-01-26.11.4	person/10307	person/10306	True	2004-01-26	blair	False	False	0	Defence	Defence	Joint Strike Fighter	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2004-01-26.7.0	I know that the hon Gentleman served with the Royal Tank Regiment, and has considerable knowledge of these affairs. We are, of course, busy recruiting to the TA as often as possible. Recruitment is a constant process throughout the year, and the hon Gentleman will know that it is conducted geographically by local TA centres. I am confident that in following the strategy set out in the strategic defence review we are going in the right direction.	2004-01-26.12.1	I thank the Minister for his response, which shows how significantly the manpower strength of the Territorial Army has declined since 1997. Given that the strategic defence review in 1998 spoke of a manpower target of 45,000, and given the increased versatility required of our Territorial Army forces following events that have taken place in the meantime, can he tell us how long it will be before that shortfall of 7,000 is made up?	2004-01-26.12.0	person/11115	person/10093	True	2004-01-26	blair	False	False	0	Defence	Defence	Territorial Army	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2004-01-26.7.1	First, I congratulate the hon Gentleman, who has also served with the TA, on completing the armed forces parliamentary scheme. The TA continuous attitude survey is due to report shortly, and it will provide an opportunity to examine issues raised by him and those raised by the various lessons learned documents from Operation Telic and Operation Fresco.	2004-01-26.12.3	Does the Minister recognise, in the light of the campaign in Iraq last year, that the Government will continue to undermine morale and retention in Territorial Army units unless they ensure that when the TA is deployed on active service its units are not cannibalised as a matter of course and, crucially, that both officers and NCOs are given credible operational roles, preferably with their own soldiers?	2004-01-26.12.2	person/10713	person/10093	True	2004-01-26	blair	False	False	0	Defence	Defence	Territorial Army	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False

Ensuring that the TA has the right footprint is an important part of our work, and we will continue to examine the estate on every possible occasion.	2004-01-26.12.5	As my hon Friend has indicated that he is looking for TA recruits, will he do something about the areas of the country from which TA units were removed in the earlier review? In particular, the matter caused grave concern in my constituency because the nearest unit is in Hertford, which is an impossible distance away, so young people in my area are not being given the chance to join the TA.	2004-01-26.12.4	person/10403	person/10093	False	2004-01-26	blair	False	False	0	Defence	Defence	Territorial Army	0	labourco-operative	False	False	labour	True	False
2004-01-26.7.3	I agree with the hon Gentleman that our reserves have served with distinction in Iraq, at home, and in other areas of the world such as the Balkans in the past 12 months and before that. I am not sure whether he really wants me to discuss Army medical services, because if I do I will delve into events during the 1992 to 1997 Parliament, which may embarrass Conservative Front Benchers. We are heavily engaged with employers through SaBRE, the supporting Britain's reservists and employers campaign, with which he is familiar. My right hon Friend the Secretary of State and I continue to discuss the matter with national employers such as the NHS, regional employers, with whom we engage through the reserve forces and cadets associations, and other small and medium-sized businesses.	2004-01-26.13.0	I am sure that the whole House appreciates the dedication, professionalism and bravery that the TA has shown and continues to show in operations in Iraq. The Government's defence White Paper states that the TA has become an integral part of the regular armed forces and that it will be increasingly used in future operations. My hon Friend the Member for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne) and others who have served in the TA have highlighted a recent survey of TA personnel who have been sent to the Gulf, which found that 80 per cent. of them do not expect their employer to support any future deployment, that 63 per cent. of medical and technical staff are thinking of resigning from the TA and that 73 per cent. of them think that the NHS has lost vital skills because of the deployment. The problem will obviously increase given the Government's defence White Paper. What practical measures are Ministers taking to the square the circle between the desire to use the TA more and employers' increasing reluctance to release staff?	2004-01-26.12.6	person/10542	person/10093	False	2004-01-26	blair	False	False	0	Defence	Defence	Territorial Army	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2004-01-26.8.0	I know that the hon Gentleman takes considerable interest in these affairs, especially in his constituency, which I have visited twice during my first six months in post. The Army welfare service provides an invaluable service, but, as he knows, the Commander-in-Chief, Land Command has a devolved budget and those decisions must be down to him. I can tell the House that there will be a review, and I hope that when it is complete I will be able to say more.	2004-01-26.13.5	I warmly endorse what the Minister says, and the expansion in Army welfare services in south Wiltshire has been particularly effective. Will he do all he can to ensure that the Commander-in-Chief, Land Command is never put in the position of having to cut Army welfare services as a soft target because of budgetary constraints, bearing in mind the fact that the pressure on Army families is growing remorselessly due to overstretch and the shortened interval between tours?	2004-01-26.13.4	person/10336	person/10093	True	2004-01-26	blair	False	False	0	Defence	Defence	Army Welfare Services	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2004-01-26.8.1	First, may I say to my right hon Friend that he will certainly be missed when he eventually leaves the House? He has been absolutely 100 per cent. behind the United Kingdom's armed forces on every possible occasion. He is right to point out the importance of the work being done by the charity Combat Stress, which I have met on a number of occasions. I am looking forward to taking the opportunity when I am next in Scotland to visit Combat Stress in his constituency.	2004-01-26.14.1	Will the Minister consider paying a visit to the excellent centre run by Combat Stress at Hollybush in my constituency? Tremendous work is being done there for people suffering from mental problems caused by various conflicts in Hollybush—that is a problem as well—or, rather, in the Falklands and Northern Ireland as well as Iraq. Does he agree that while the remarks of the hon Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis) were meant in the kindest possible way, it is far, far too early, if there is any justice in this world, for any member of our excellent Front-Bench team to be considering making valedictory remarks?	2004-01-26.14.0	person/10211	person/10093	False	2004-01-26	blair	False	False	0	Defence	Defence	Army Welfare Services	0	labourco-operative	False	False	labour	True	False

However, he forgot to mention Colchester—a rare moment in the House. As he knows, we are putting more money into service children's education and we will continue to do so. As he also knows, I am looking forward to visiting Colchester garrison in March.	2004-01-26.14.3	The Minister rightly draws attention to and praises Army welfare services for the excellent work that they have done, particularly last year during the Iraq conflict. Does he agree that the work they do week in, week out plays an important part in the retention of soldiers and that there needs to be more involvement on the education side so that soldiers with children at school get a better deal?	2004-01-26.14.2	person/10521	person/10093	False	2004-01-26	blair	False	False	0	Defence	Defence	Army Welfare Services	0	liberal-democrat	False	False	labour	True	False
2004-01-26.8.3	I thank my hon Friend for that important contribution. She is right—I am not sure that this matter has been properly dealt with in the past. As she will be aware, however, we are engaged with the Priory group to provide psychiatric services and we very much hope that that will put an end to some of those problems.	2004-01-26.14.5	Is my hon Friend satisfied that the review will consider the provision of psychiatric support services for those who have served in various wars? This is a real problem for young soldiers and there has not been sufficient support in the past, which is a price that we cannot afford to pay as a community.	2004-01-26.14.4	person/10181	person/10093	False	2004-01-26	blair	False	False	0	Defence	Defence	Army Welfare Services	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

I welcome the Secretary of State's announcement this morning on the future tanker aircraft as a massive boost to Airbus at Broughton and to the economy of north Wales.

2004-01-26.10.0	I am grateful to my hon Friend for his observation. He might like to know that we supported the refurbishment of more than 90 schools in our area of operations. Another 140 further refurbishment projects are under way. As for the health service in Iraq, we have completed 65 general health projects, 16 hospital projects, 32 health centre projects and seven veterinary centre projects.	2004-01-26.16.1	I thank my right hon Friend for that exhaustive update on the quick-impact projects that are under way. I must pay personal tribute to the work of our troops in carrying out this important work. Will my right hon Friend ensure that he prioritises within the Department the work in hospitals and schools? Beyond the quick-impact projects and the benefits that they will bring, it is the long-term benefits that will be brought through health and education projects that will lead to the prosperity and health of the Iraqi people.	2004-01-26.16.0	person/11347	person/10286	True	2004-01-26	blair	False	False	0	Defence	Defence	Iraq	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

Certainly, all the television programmes that I have seen providing footage of the operations conducted by British personnel have shown how expert those soldiers are in dealing with the threats to order that we have seen from time to time in southern Iraq. They have used precisely the same kind of techniques and equipment that I myself have seen them use when they have been training in Northern Ireland.	2004-01-26.16.3	The Secretary of State will agree that one of the most important contributions that the Army can make to reconstruction in Iraq is maintaining internal security and public order, as evidenced by dealing with the recent riots in Basra. Does the right hon Gentleman agree that it would be wholly unacceptable if, six months after the end of the major operations in Iraq, our armed forces did not have sufficient riot control equipment in Basra?	2004-01-26.16.2	person/10051	person/10286	False	2004-01-26	blair	False	False	0	Defence	Defence	Iraq	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False

Although there are continuing concerns about security—less in the south than in other parts of Iraq—real progress is being made in reconstructing the country.	2004-01-26.16.5	I and other members of the Defence Committee visited Iraq last year and saw some of the sterling work that is being undertaken by MOD personnel in some of the quick-win projects. Will my right hon Friend join me in paying tribute to the work of staff not only of the MOD but from the Department for International Development, the Foreign Office and the non-governmental organisations, who are making a real difference in regenerating schools and putting infrastructure in place—work which is unfortunately not widely reported in the British media, but which is making a real difference in Iraq?	2004-01-26.16.4	person/11003	person/10286	False	2004-01-26	blair	False	False	0	Defence	Defence	Iraq	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2004-01-26.10.3	I congratulate the hon Gentleman on his ingenuity, but he needs to check more carefully the precise circumstances in which military action was taken. It was taken on the basis of resolution 1441. We know that Saddam Hussein had used weapons of mass destruction previously; 1441 was given by the United Nations to Saddam Hussein as a last opportunity to co-operate with the international community. The coalition forces judged that he had failed to take that last opportunity. I am sure that a fair-minded observer of these affairs, as the hon Gentleman is, would reach that conclusion.	2004-01-26.17.1	"Given that a vital part of the reconstruction of Iraq is presumably the discovery and removal of weapons of mass destruction, may I remind the Secretary of State of an answer that he gave to me more than six months ago, when I asked him whether the failure to find weapons of mass destruction undermined the legality of the case for war? He gave a four-word answer, which was, ""They will be found."" Does the right hon Gentleman still believe that? If not, does he not think that it is about time that the public saw all the legal opinion upon which the Government based the case for war?"	2004-01-26.17.0	person/10999	person/10286	False	2004-01-26	blair	False	False	0	Defence	Defence	Iraq	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2004-01-26.10.4	I am sure my hon Friend recognises that it is public money that is going into Iraq—largely the public money provided by the US taxpayer. It is not entirely surprising, therefore, that the US tends to look first to its own companies to provide assistance. Nevertheless, there are significant opportunities for British companies to participate in projects in Iraq, which they are doing, and for other countries that are not even members of the coalition.	2004-01-26.17.3	But is not unemployment in Iraq, including in the UK-occupied sector, running at a rate of about 70 per cent., and is not the UK following the approach of the United States of privatisation and foreign contractors, and in the case of the United States, corrupt sweetheart deals? There is plenty for the state to do there. Should there not be a massive programme of public spending and public ownership to get those Iraqis back into work? Would that not be better for the Iraqis and safer for the troops?	2004-01-26.17.2	person/10123	person/10286	False	2004-01-26	blair	False	False	0	Defence	Defence	Iraq	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

They make these lurid accusations without so much as seeking the view of the Department. I can tell him that the allegations are wholly unfounded. I will write and give him greater detail on this point.	2004-01-26.18.1	Is the Minister aware of reports this weekend that show that the lack of a radio may have been a cause of the tragic death of six British military policemen who were killed by a mob in Iraq last year? Is that not yet another example of our troops being sent into active military operations without the proper equipment? Will the Minister support the families of those brave troops in seeking a public inquiry into those deaths?	2004-01-26.18.0	person/11245	person/10306	True	2004-01-26	blair	False	False	0	Defence	Defence	Logistics Support	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2004-01-26.11.1	The reality was that those tanks—the heavy armour to which the hon Gentleman refers—had 95 per cent. reliability. He should read the National Audit Office report and the lessons learned, and stop throwing around accusations not based upon the breadth of examination that was carried out. If any lessons need to be learned about equipment shortcomings or failures, they will be learned. That is what the NAO report is about and it is why we carry out such an intensive investigation into our own experiences. Iraq tells us a lot about what needs to be done for the future.	2004-01-26.18.3	Could the Minister look at logistical support for our heavy armoured brigade, particularly in light of recent events in Iraq, and ensure that in future they have chemical filters that work for more than six hours?	2004-01-26.18.2	person/11345	person/10306	False	2004-01-26	blair	False	False	0	Defence	Defence	Logistics Support	0	liberal-democrat	False	False	labour	True	False
2004-01-26.12.0	I do not think the hon Lady listened to my earlier answer. We have said consistently that there will be combined and joint operations with allies, and if we find ourselves in theatre of conflict, mutual protection is afforded to all. The decision was taken to dispense with the Sea Harrier. It was an old aircraft and to upgrade it would have cost a considerable sum of money, was technically complicated and might not have produced the necessary result. The Type 45 destroyers will come on stream later in the decade and they will afford an immense level of protection to the Navy.	2004-01-26.19.0	The air defence Sea Harrier is being withdrawn before the new joint strike fighter becomes available, and we also hear that the number of destroyers and frigates is being reduced.

Progress has been made and the Navy is very much looking forward to getting the vessels.	2004-01-26.19.2	I am glad that my hon Friend mentioned the aircraft carriers, because that is the matter that I want to address. He will be aware that the size of the aircraft carrier will determine the response time for landing and take-off, in that that will be much quicker on the larger ships than on the smaller ships.

2004-01-26.13.0	My hon Friend is quite right that there is no single military solution to international terrorism and the Ministry of Defence must work closely with other Departments in ensuring that we use all effective means to tackle terrorism. For example, the Treasury may well have a significant role to play, as does the Ministry of Defence, in cutting off sources of finance. But I can assure my hon Friend, as I assure the House, that we work closely right across this Government and in co-operation with other Governments in dealing with the threat of international terrorism.	2004-01-26.19.7	Given that at least some of the activities that my right hon Friend mentioned do not involve the use of force, can he explain to the House how the Ministry of Defence is co-ordinating the activities of other Departments as they meet their obligations in the Government's fight against international terrorism?	2004-01-26.19.6	person/10941	person/10286	True	2004-01-26	blair	False	False	0	Defence	Defence	International Terrorism	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

Again, she flags up a concern shared by everyone in the House. That is why I am pleased that the OSCE is focusing on anti-Semitism. I know that the French Government are taking strong steps in that regard, as are the German Government, and we, too, must keep a watchful eye on the situation because hate language in British politics—whether on immigrants, on questions to do with Israel and the right of the Jewish people to their state, or on the problems faced by many of my Muslim constituents—is, I am afraid, on the rise, rather than going down.	2004-06-15.626.1	Does the Minister recognise the gravity of anti-Semitism coming from some Islamic sources that links up with the anti-Semitism of the far right in advocating Jewish conspiracy theories, blood libels and holocaust denial?

I accept fully the concerns of the hon Member for South Norfolk (Mr. Bacon) , but if he has one piece of direct evidence of any money circuiting back into anti-Semitic organisations in Europe, I would love to see it because I promise him and the House that I would take that up with every bit of vigour that I possess.	2004-06-15.626.3	It would be disturbing, would it not, if it turned out that taxpayers were helping to fund anti-Semitism and attacks on Jewish people? Yet when I recently visited OLAF, the anti-fraud agency in Brussels, Mr. Alberto Perduca, the official in charge of looking at funding for the Palestinians, admitted that it could not be ruled out that cash used by the EU to give funding to the Palestinian Authority might in some cases have made its way to groups to which it should not have made its way.

2004-06-15.1.0	"I resist the idea that we should force the pace of change in the way that my hon Friend sets out. We in Europe need to have a certain amount of humility in respect of this issue. Only 30 years ago, which is within the lifetime of many in this House, not only was half of Europe under the Soviets' control, but three countries in southern Europe—Portugal, Spain and Greece—all had fascist dictatorships. We would have resisted the idea that our pace of change within Europe should be forced from outside. We have to encourage change and support the many people in all countries in the region who are actively pursuing change.
Saudi Arabia is beginning a process of reform, even though it might not be as fast as my hon Friend would wish. Local council elections will be held shortly, and in many countries in the region there are now the beginnings—in some cases, more than the beginnings—of active democratic institutions."	2004-06-15.627.1	The Prime Minister told me yesterday that democracy in the middle east has got to come from within, but if that is the case, surely we will be waiting for ever. What are the Government doing to force the pace of change in dysfunctional societies such as Saudi Arabia, where women cannot even legally drive a car? In a recent case, a female television presenter was beaten up by her husband for daring to answer the telephone. Saudi Arabia is supposedly an ally of ours.

That said, the Palestinian Authority themselves have to take further steps—they could take such steps, even now—to improve the operation of their democratic institutions. For example, they could place the security forces under the full and proper control of the Prime Minister and the Interior Minister, and ensure that they are paid through bank accounts rather than in cash.
In terms of the withdrawal from Gaza, there may be a need for further international aid. I am afraid that the value of some of the aid has been destroyed by Israeli incursions, but we simply have to accept that and try to move on."	2004-06-15.627.3	Can the Foreign Secretary tell the House what his view is of conditions for democratic life in Gaza, where the infrastructure has been systematically damaged, houses have been indiscriminately destroyed and demolished, and the quality of life has been comprehensively diminished?

Of course, their political institutions are not in a state that we would describe as full democracy. The important thing is that that is now recognised within the region itself, and there is a clear programme of reform that has been agreed by the Arab League, not least at its summit in Tunis.	2004-06-15.628.3	Would the Foreign Secretary tell the House whether there are any democratic states in the middle east other than Israel?	2004-06-15.628.2	person/10588	person/10574	False	2004-06-15	blair	False	False	0	Foreign And Commonwealth Affairs	Foreign And Commonwealth Affairs	Middle East	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False

It made the point that it is difficult to hold elections where candidates cannot get from one place to another and voters do not know whether they can reach a polling station because they are under curfew.

Hopefully, if we can make progress on the EU-Mercosur agreement, that would be a significant step forward. It is clearly in our interests and in the interests of the Brazilians that President Lula's Government succeed. Finally, I am sure that the Foreign Secretary has heard my hon Friend's request.	2004-06-15.629.5	Having just returned from an Inter-Parliamentary Union delegation to Brazil— [Laughter.]— may I tell my hon Friend that it is clear that the Brazilian Government want a very strong relationship with Europe, both politically and commercially, to balance their relations with the USA? Does he agree that it is also in our interests and vital for the whole of south America that progressive democratic Government can deliver and succeed in Brazil? For both those reasons, may I suggest to my right hon Friend the Secretary of State that if he does have a life beyond the middle east, Iraq and the European constitution, he should give some priority to visiting Brazil?	2004-06-15.629.4	person/10049	person/10496	True	2004-06-15	blair	False	False	0	Foreign And Commonwealth Affairs	Foreign And Commonwealth Affairs	Brazil	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

I agree with the right hon and learned Gentleman about the importance of the resumption of dialogue, and that is why a director-level delegation from the leaders of the Quartet will visit the region shortly.

I was last there at the beginning of February and intend to visit again as quickly as I can, and so will the Prime Minister.	2004-06-15.634.1	Given the likely enormous economic potential and political importance of India over the coming decades, and given the United Kingdom's special links with India in all sorts of ways, will the Foreign Secretary make it a priority of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to ensure that the highest attention is given to promoting Indo-British relations?	2004-06-15.634.0	person/10051	person/10574	False	2004-06-15	blair	False	False	0	Foreign And Commonwealth Affairs	Foreign And Commonwealth Affairs	India	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2004-06-15.4.3	In January, I met Sonia Gandhi and Natwar Singh when they were in opposition, and they made clear to me their commitment to, and support for, the then Government's efforts—the Vajpayee-Musharraf efforts—to secure a composite dialogue, including on the issue of Kashmir. From my telephone contact with Natwar Singh earlier, I am in no doubt at all—nor shall I be, I am sure, after my meetings with him tomorrow—that the Congress-led Government will have the same commitment to pursue that dialogue, which has already produced great benefits for both sides and offers the prospect of a peaceful resolution to the 60-year-old dispute over the area of Kashmir.	2004-06-15.634.3	I add my congratulations to India on its vibrant democracy and its continuing commitment to a secular society.

2004-06-15.5.0	My hon Friend is right: we face a serious challenge in tackling opium cultivation in Afghanistan. I should point out that cultivation has not doubled; the latest United Nations survey shows a marginal increase in cultivation compared with last year. However, it seems from anecdotal reports that this year there will be an increase in cultivation in the current planting season. That pattern is not inconsistent with countries where there has been success in tackling the problem—initially there is an increase. However, the key is a comprehensive strategy, as my hon Friend rightly pointed out, which includes provision for alternative livelihoods.	2004-06-15.635.0	I thank my hon Friend for that response and for his commitment to eliminating the international drugs trade. Although I have never been on an IPU trip, does he accept the situation described in an excellent article on Afghanistan published in the Sunday Herald this week? It pointed out that opium production had doubled between 2002 and 2003 and included an interview with an individual who earned £65 for 5 kg of opium. Does my hon Friend agree that it is essential that the international community provide alternative sources of income for people in Afghanistan if they are to make real progress and stop the growth of poppy fields in Afghanistan in future?	2004-06-15.634.7	person/10671	person/10496	True	2004-06-15	blair	False	False	0	Foreign And Commonwealth Affairs	Foreign And Commonwealth Affairs	Drugs Trade	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2004-06-15.5.1	Let me give the hon Gentleman some specifics on the progress that is being made. A team of Afghan counter-narcotics police officers is now in place, which has seized 125 kilos of heroin. Similarly, the Afghan special narcotics force—an Afghan initiative under the control of the Ministry of the Interior—has seized more than 32 tonnes of opiates and destroyed 32 laboratories. Nevertheless, I do not deny that we face a significant challenge—it is not solely our responsibility—on behalf of the Afghan people and the international community, because anecdotal evidence suggests that cultivation and production may increase again this year. Nevertheless, all the measures that are now in place suggest that in the current 15 months, particularly in the next planting season, we should begin to see, if our strategy is working—I believe that it is—the tide beginning to turn.	2004-06-15.635.2	Since our Government took over the fight against the drug trade in Afghanistan in April 2002, how many hectares of poppies have been destroyed, how many trafficking networks have been dismantled and how much land has been turned over to alternative production? As we have heard, the UN report last year showed that the situation was getting worse. When another UN report is compiled this autumn, does the Minister expect it to show that things are improving under British leadership or still getting worse?	2004-06-15.635.1	person/10575	person/10496	False	2004-06-15	blair	False	False	0	Foreign And Commonwealth Affairs	Foreign And Commonwealth Affairs	Drugs Trade	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2004-06-15.5.2	I am aware of those concerns, and they underline the problem that, whatever we might say in the House, when we seek to tackle the international drugs trade, we are dealing with one of the most sophisticated, expensively funded organised crime rackets in the world. Everywhere we make an impact on the system—we hope that we will succeed in Afghanistan—we must be aware of the knock-on consequences for those places where the industry will try to go next. That is very much at the forefront of our thinking.	2004-06-15.635.4	Is my hon Friend aware that, last year, Europol reported to the Committee on the Civil Dimension of Security, which is part of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, that its worst nightmares had been realised: laboratories in southern Europe are now producing synthetic cocaine and synthetic heroin that is of a decent level? Its fear is that, once we start to tackle the situation in Afghanistan, that synthetic heroin and cocaine will come on to the market, as the price begins to change. What are we doing, together with other international partners, to tackle that and those laboratories?	2004-06-15.635.3	person/10105	person/10496	False	2004-06-15	blair	False	False	0	Foreign And Commonwealth Affairs	Foreign And Commonwealth Affairs	Drugs Trade	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2004-06-15.5.3	I pay tribute to the Royal Navy and the work that it undertakes to support our efforts, but the other point that the hon Gentleman's question underlines is that, in dealing with the problem elsewhere in the world, we are working not just for the benefit for the people of those countries, but in our own vested interests. The cocaine that originates in Colombia comes to this country, and 95 per cent. of the heroin from Afghanistan fuels the drugs trade in this country. We have a massive vested interest in tackling the problem, which is why we are devoting so much work and investment to it.	2004-06-15.636.1	Will the Minister also pay tribute to the Royal Navy for its contribution to tackling the international drugs trade? Recently, HMS Northumberland seized cocaine worth £135 million and HMS Iron Duke seized cocaine worth £250 million. If they had not done so, those drugs would have ended up on the streets of a country somewhere, bringing huge misery. Will he pay tribute to the Royal Navy for using the intelligence available and seizing the drugs? It is vital that they are given the necessary support to ensure that they have a presence on the high seas to tackle the drugs problem where it exists.	2004-06-15.636.0	person/10190	person/10496	False	2004-06-15	blair	False	False	0	Foreign And Commonwealth Affairs	Foreign And Commonwealth Affairs	Drugs Trade	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False

As for the position of Mr. Aziz and other detainees, I should say to my hon Friend that just before I left the Foreign Office to come here, I saw an item on the BBC website. Although I have had no separate confirmation of this, it says:
""Iraqi Prime Minister Iyad Allawi says the US-led coalition will soon hand over high-profile detainees—including Saddam Hussein—to Iraqi custody.""
If that is to happen, it will be widely welcomed in the House. It is a matter on which I know the Iraqis and the United States are working."	2004-06-15.636.6	"We are part of the coalition, are we not? Will the response to the International Red Cross be the proverbial ""Get lost"", when it says that, under international law, those people, included Tariq Aziz, should be charged before 30 June or freed?

2004-06-15.6.1	We have made strong representations to the Iraqis about our position in respect of the death penalty. We were successful during the period of the Iraq governing council in persuading it to suspend the death penalty. It is known that Iraqi Ministers have said that they will support the re-establishment of the death penalty from 30 June , and it is also a fact that a number of countries around the world, including China and the United States, are retentionist and operate the death penalty. However, in respect of all those countries, not least and including Iraq, we shall make very strong representations about the need not to use the death penalty. Those representations will be made on both moral grounds, which are well supported in the House, and on very practical grounds. As we in this country found with the death penalty 50 years ago, one can end up not only convicting the wrong person, but executing the wrong person.	2004-06-15.637.1	Given that the right hon Gentleman and the Government have a principled opposition to the death penalty and given that Britain, as part of the coalition provisional authority, will shortly hand over Saddam Hussein for trial, can the right hon Gentleman say what representations, if any, he has made to ensure that the future Iraqi authorities do not put Saddam Hussein to death?

Interestingly, there were more than 1,800 applications for appointment and a shortlist of candidates was interviewed by a panel of experts led by Judge Kriegler of South Africa. The final commission consists of seven commissioners, including two women and one United Nations member. It bodes well for the future.
On the electoral system itself—my hon Friend takes an interest in such matters, as do I—Mrs. Perelli has recommended that the introduction of a national list system for interim elections to the national congress should take place between now and January. Obviously, the subsequent election system operated will be a matter for the constituent assembly that draws up the new constitution."	2004-06-15.638.1	"I feel that my question has rather got lost by being linked with the question from the hon Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink) . My question is specifically about electoral systems.
If Iraq is to move beyond a rather theoretical legal sovereignty on 30 June towards full political sovereignty on 31 January next year, is not the role of the United Nations of key importance, especially in relation to the establishment of an electoral system?

The hon Gentleman will know that troop numbers are kept under continuous review and that any changes will be announced to the House by my right hon Friend the Secretary of State for Defence.	2004-06-15.638.3	Could the right hon Gentleman tell the House exactly what support will be provided by Britain in the run up to the 2005 elections?

I wrote to her with an interim reply in November and examined the matter in great detail. I also looked at the non-governmental organisation website www.iraqbodycount.org , which has its own estimates. I owe my hon Friend an answer and I am sorry that she has not received one, but that is not due to a lack of application.
On the ""Today"" programme a couple of weeks ago, I said that I had answered a question about the matter. I was speaking from my recollections, as I made clear at the time, but I should like to point out that I had answered a supplementary question during a statement rather than a parliamentary question—with a capital Q. I apologise for that minor transgression."	2004-06-15.638.5	The Foreign Secretary will recall my question of 8 September about the number of Iraqi deaths. He was kind enough to write to me in November to confirm that when the information was collated, he would write again and place the information in the Library.

Given that recent intelligence suggests that Saddam Hussein and his immediate family and entourage benefited to the tune of $10 billion, and that intelligence coming out of Iraq suggests that that money is being used to fund the insurgency that faces our troops and threatens the elections, what moves have the Foreign Office taken to back the Iraq governing council's call for a full and independent inquiry?	2004-06-15.639.0	person/11190	person/10574	False	2004-06-15	blair	False	False	0	Foreign And Commonwealth Affairs	Foreign And Commonwealth Affairs	Iraq	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False

We adhere to the common EU position, which was renewed on 26 April , that targets EU sanctions on members of the regime, not the people of Burma, who have already suffered enough under that awful regime. Those sanctions include a visa ban on leading members of the regime, an assets freeze and an arms embargo.	2004-06-15.640.1	My hon Friend will be aware that concern about the situation in Burma is shared across the House and the country. In Edinburgh, for example, the city council has recently voted unanimously to offer the freedom of the city to Aung San Suu Kyi. In view of that widespread concern, is it not time for tough, effective sanctions to be imposed on the regime in Burma to make it improve its dreadful human rights record?	2004-06-15.640.0	person/11038	person/10451	True	2004-06-15	blair	False	False	0	Foreign And Commonwealth Affairs	Foreign And Commonwealth Affairs	Burma	0	labourco-operative	False	False	labour	True	False

As for the constitutional convention, we respect the decision of the National League for Democracy not to take part, because it is clearly a bogus exercise. It would make no sense at all for it to take part while its leaders are detained, its offices closed down and there is not a shred of democracy in Burma.	2004-06-15.640.5	My hon Friend will know that the junta in Burma has been running a national convention from which the National League for Democracy—NLD—has been excluded. That convention has drafted a constitution that ensures military dominance, which is surely a further retrograde step. Most of Burma's trading is now conducted in euros, since the US has imposed financial sanctions. Is it not time to approach our European partners seriously about financial sanctions against that terrible regime?	2004-06-15.640.4	person/10709	person/10451	False	2004-06-15	blair	False	False	0	Foreign And Commonwealth Affairs	Foreign And Commonwealth Affairs	Burma	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

Is he aware of the campaign by Amnesty International to stop violence against women and the fact that the situation in Turkey is so bad that Amnesty has issued a country-specific report highlighting the fact that honour killings are widespread, lenient sentences for rape are common and that Turkish authorities rarely investigate complaints by women about rape or murder? Will he do all that he can to persuade the Turkish Government that it is in their best interest to make sure not only that international and regional treaties are ratified but that perpetrators are brought to justice so that violence against women is ended in that country?	2004-06-15.641.0	person/10677	person/10401	True	2004-06-15	blair	False	False	0	Foreign And Commonwealth Affairs	Foreign And Commonwealth Affairs	Turkey	0	liberal-democrat	False	False	labour	True	False
2004-06-15.9.1	Quite so. Every human rights representative, lawyer or organisation with whom I have been in contact in Turkey has urged that Europe gives a positive response at the end of the year to Turkey's application to be considered as an EU member. They believe that that will be the second great modernisation of Turkey, after the Ataturk modernisation. They want to see European Union values, ideas and officials, and EU money being spent in Turkey to continue that process of modernisation.	2004-06-15.641.3	My hon Friend rightly points to the substantial improvement in Turkey's human rights record since the election of the present Government, but he also points out, rightly, that Turkey has some considerable way to go to conform to its existing commitments as a signatory to the convention on human rights of the Council of Europe. Will my hon Friend make it clear that while human rights are certainly a measure by which Turkey's accession to the European Union will be judged, from Britain's point of view we want Turkey to be a member and one that conforms to proper EU standards, and that those from other partner countries in the EU who seem to wish to impose an arbitrary block on Turkey are heading in the wrong direction?	2004-06-15.641.2	person/10367	person/10401	False	2004-06-15	blair	False	False	0	Foreign And Commonwealth Affairs	Foreign And Commonwealth Affairs	Turkey	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

May I, through you, Mr. Speaker, thank him for raising forcefully in Turkey last month the case of Leyla Zana and other human rights issues in the discussions with the Foreign Minister, Abdullah Gul. My hon Friend was treading in the footsteps of the Prime Minister, who has also made representations on human rights issues directly to the Turkish Government, and he is right, of course, that in our dialogue with the Islamic world, there is an enormous opportunity to see an Islamic democratic state with great problems—I accept that—that is seeking to move in the direction of Europe. The Mediterranean coastline of Turkey lies to the west of that EU member state, Cyprus. Istanbul is a cradle city of European civilisation. I hope all member states will support Turkey's ambitions, if it meets all the relevant criteria.	2004-06-15.641.5	Does my hon Friend agree that if a start date for negotiations is given in December, it will send a positive message that negotiations are to begin with a predominantly Muslim country, which will help us to define our concept of what Europe is?	2004-06-15.641.4	person/10842	person/10401	True	2004-06-15	blair	False	False	0	Foreign And Commonwealth Affairs	Foreign And Commonwealth Affairs	Turkey	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2004-06-15.9.3	I agree with the hon Gentleman, who is a great expert on Austria, where some of those symptoms manifest themselves. I urge all the Opposition parties, but principally the main Opposition party, to become actively involved in a pro-European way in the European People's party, to enter into a dialogue with the Conservative and Christian Democratic parties of Europe, to drop their ridiculous continuing obsessive hostility to Europe and to become pro-British and pro-Turkish by becoming pro-European.	2004-06-15.642.1	But is the Minister not concerned by the developing opposition of a number of leading European political parties to the eventual Turkish membership of the European Union?

2004-06-15.9.4	It seems that since Sunday we are making distinct progress. Here is one aspect of European policy on which I can agree with every word the right hon and learned Gentleman said. I pay sincere tribute to the statements of the shadow Europe Minister on Turkey. There is no division between the Front Benchers on this issue. I would simply say that the Conservatives could be strong advocates for Turkish membership if they were to be active players in Europe instead of being seen, as they are at the moment, to be permanently hostile to Britain's full engagement in the European Union, particularly under the forthcoming constitutional treaty.	2004-06-15.642.3	I am tempted to ask whether that was the message that the Minister got on his pager earlier. Will he use what influence he has with his European colleagues to expedite the announcement of a starting date for the negotiations on accession for Turkey? Turkey is making welcome efforts to conform to the Copenhagen criteria. It has been immensely constructive recently in seeking to resolve the problems of Cyprus, and of course it has been a staunch ally for many years in NATO. Would Turkey not also bring great value to the European Union as a natural bridge between Europe and the Islamic world, as also having historic links with the middle east and having very strong relations with the state of Israel? Does the Minister agree that an early start to negotiations, however long they may take to complete, will give Turkey the encouragement it needs to make progress at this time?	2004-06-15.642.2	person/10010	person/10401	False	2004-06-15	blair	False	False	0	Foreign And Commonwealth Affairs	Foreign And Commonwealth Affairs	Turkey	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2004-06-15.10.0	My hon Friend is right. As the Foreign Secretary made clear in his statement on 28 April , Britain is engaged in dialogue with both communities on the island. The people in the north of Cyprus—the Turkish Cypriots—sent a clear yes to Europe; unfortunately, that was not the result from the Greek Cypriots. We believe that the UN Secretary-General's plan remains the best way forward for allowing a united Cyprus to enter the European Union.	2004-06-15.644.0	I am grateful to the Minister for that reply. Does he agree that now that the Turkish Cypriots have overwhelmingly voted yes in the referendum, we should be considering not only how we can start to normalise relations with the northern part of Cyprus, but how we can talk to the Greek Cypriot population, perhaps with our colleagues in the European Union, to try to make real progress towards a united island of Cyprus?	2004-06-15.643.3	person/10319	person/10401	True	2004-06-15	blair	False	False	0	Foreign And Commonwealth Affairs	Foreign And Commonwealth Affairs	Cyprus	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

HMP Weare has proved to be an unalloyed success, and we have made no final decision about its future. We will ensure that the courts have at their disposal all the accommodation necessary to hold prisoners safely and securely. We are determined to hold prisoners in that way, not least because our concern—unlike that of the Liberal Democrats—is not, first and foremost, the number of people in prison, but how best we reduce crime.	2000-01-17a.537.10	Will the Minister confirm whether it is to become official Government policy to use prison hulks to tackle overcrowding? Will the life of HMP Weare be extended beyond the agreed finish date of 2003?

I have had some communication on the issue with the Assembly Members concerned and I will bear the right hon Gentleman's suggestion in mind.	2000-01-17a.538.0	"The Minister will be aware of the strong feeling in north and mid-Wales that there is no local prison, and that the prisons serving

the area are inconvenient, with prisoners not in their own communities. If there is a need for additional prison capacity, will he look at the possibility of an additional prison in north and mid-Wales and of using European funds to help finance it?"	2000-01-17a.537.13	person/10635	person/10052	False	2000-01-17	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Prison Overcrowding	0	plaid-cymru	False	False	labour	True	False
2000-01-17.0.3	We have in mind the need to make sure that we locate prisoners as near as possible to their family centres and that we take steps to ensure that the reintegration and rehabilitation of prisoners is not undermined by capacity issues. My hon Friend will appreciate the operational imperatives in terms of ensuring that we have a system that is suitably flexible to enable us to hold prisoners in conditions of safety and security. He will be aware that we have reduced overcrowding in our prisons from the high level that we inherited. However, there is no room for complacency and we keep a close eye on the figures.	2000-01-17a.538.2	Does not the management of prison capacity have undesirable side-effects, such as the movement of prisoners hundreds of miles away from their friends and relatives? Does it not disrupt education programmes?

2000-01-17.0.4	It was my right hon Friend the Home Secretary who brought HMP Weare into play, and it was he who took steps to solve the problem of prison overcrowding. Before the right hon Lady casts any strictures in our direction, she should consider her own record in government. In 1996–97, prisons were at 106.2 per cent. capacity; now the figure is 105.6 per cent.—it is lower. There is worse: in 1997–98, the last year for which the Conservatives had stewardship of the Prison Service, the figure was 108.1 per cent. The right hon Lady is in no position to cast aspersions in our direction. We are on course to meet—	2000-01-17a.538.4	I welcome the Minister's statement that HMP Weare has been a resounding success, given all that Labour said about the use of a ship when we introduced it. What percentage of prisoners are in cells designed for one prisoner, but being used by two? What percentage of prisoners are in cells designed for two prisoners, but being shared by three? In how many prisons has slopping out returned—on however limited a scale—as a result of bringing back into use old accommodation?	2000-01-17a.538.3	person/10634	person/10052	False	2000-01-17	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Prison Overcrowding	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False

exceeded today. The figure is on target for the key performance indicator by which one measures the number of prisoners in overcrowded cells.

What percentage of the prison population is sharing two to a cell designed for one? I shall ask the questions very slowly so that he can look up the answers. What percentage of the prison population is sharing three to a cell designed for two? In how many prisons has slopping out, which we eliminated completely, returned as a result of bringing old accommodation back into use? Those are three simple questions.

2000-01-17.1.0	The hon Gentleman is misinformed about the background to the project. It has arisen not because we have sold off the radio spectrum but because the Government whom he supported agreed, in the mid-1990s, that the spectrum for the police service should change under the terms of an EU directive. A digital radio and data system that will cover the whole country is a vital need for the police service. It will become operational in all police services by 2004, although I cannot give him a precise date for Surrey. The cost will be £150 million a year, which adds up to £1.5 billion over the life of the project. We have already found £50 million from the capital modernisation fund for the immediate costs and, of course, as we agree funding for the police service—including for Surrey—for subsequent years, we will take fully into account the costs of the capital radio project.	2000-01-17a.540.1	While one accepts that the new system will improve the police's communication capacity, does not part of the need for it derive from the fact that the Government have sold off part of the radio spectrum? The Home Secretary mentioned costs of £150 million a year, but the total cost will be some £1.5 billion, of which the Government will produce the generous amount of £50 million from the central budget. When will Surrey have the benefit of the new radio system, and what will be the consequences for Surrey's budget of having to pay for that Government-imposed requirement? Over the next few years, Surrey will move from having the best crime prevention rates in the country and a good funding settlement to having the worst funding settlement—the Home Secretary has offered to meet me to discuss that.	2000-01-17a.540.0	person/10051	person/10574	True	2000-01-17	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Public Safety Radio Communications Project	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2000-01-17.1.1	"I entirely accept my hon Friend's comments. Investment in technology for the police service has been made in the past. Some of that investment has been successful, but some has not, not least because the decisions have been left to individual police services, which has sometimes led to incompatible radio and IT


systems. That is why it is essential for the future that, as far as possible, large IT projects such as the police radio project are co-ordinated on a national basis."	2000-01-17a.540.3	In my experience, the only people who will not welcome this investment in proper technological support for the police are the criminals. If we ensure that the police have such support, they will do their job much more effectively. Does my right hon Friend accept that, in the past 20 years, the pattern of investment in all technology has been patchy and that this Government need to address those areas in which money was not invested in the past to try to bring the police force up to a reasonable standard within a reasonable time?	2000-01-17a.540.2	person/10609	person/10574	False	2000-01-17	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Public Safety Radio Communications Project	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2000-01-17.1.2	The only period in the past 10 years when there was a real-terms cut in police service funding occurred in, I think, 1995–96, under the previous Administration. We have set out firm spending plans for the year 2000–01. Additionally, for that year, we have allocated this extra £35 million as the first slice to pay for the 5,000 additional officers. The money for the following years will be announced as part of the spending review 2000, which will be announced later this year.	2000-01-17a.541.1	It is true that the radio communications project is welcomed by the police and that a contribution will be made to it from central funds. However, can the Home Secretary yet tell us whether he has made a decision about future general funding to pay for the project and for the police recruitment that he plans? He has announced £35 million from the crime-fighting fund for next year; it will cost at least £150 million to recruit 5,000 police officers, let alone to keep them on after that. When will both the Met—whose outgoing Commissioner has warned of the problem—and the rest of the police forces know that they have the money guaranteed to ensure that they have a real-terms increase in funds, not a real-terms cut?	2000-01-17a.541.0	person/10298	person/10574	False	2000-01-17	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Public Safety Radio Communications Project	0	liberal-democrat	False	False	labour	True	False
2000-01-17.1.3	That was a rather ropy question. The hon Gentleman is right to say that that 80 per cent. of the costs will be paid from the central police grant and that deductions will be made in the grant. That is the only rational way to fund the project. However, I have already made clear what funding will be announced for 2001 and thereafter. The hon Gentleman referred to the most difficult time that police forces face. In response, I can do no better than to quote Mr. Paul Scott-Lee, the chief constable of Suffolk. Speaking about our crime-fighting fund and the 5,000 extra officers, he said that his force had had its most difficult time about five years ago. That was when real-terms spending on the police went down, not up.	2000-01-17a.541.3	Will not 80 per cent. of the £1.4 billion that this important radio project costs be paid by police authorities, through the common police services budget? That decision has already been taken, but the costs come on top of the shortfall of £1.2 billion in police funding over the next three years predicted by the police service forecasting group, working on behalf of the police authorities. I think that the right hon Gentleman will receive the group's findings any day now. They show that the police service cannot afford to meet the radio project costs without further cuts in the number of police officers. When will the Home Secretary face up to the reality of the worst funding crisis for our police service in living memory? The issue may not have prompted the press mauling that the right hon Gentleman has suffered recently in connection with other matters, but if he does not punch his weight more effectively with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, he will be on the canvas and counted out.	2000-01-17a.541.2	person/10242	person/10574	False	2000-01-17	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Public Safety Radio Communications Project	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2000-01-17.2.0	I am aware of the issues raised by my hon Friend, and I have discussed them with senior police officers in Kent. In fact, the other day I discussed those very matters—organised crime, smuggling and trafficking in people—with the Minister of State, Home Office, my hon Friend the Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Mrs. Roche). We also discussed how those crimes impacted on the people of Kent. My hon Friend makes a good point. I assure him that we will keep the question of organised crime in Kent— the gateway to Europe—under close review.	2000-01-17a.542.3	I am grateful for that answer, and especially for the Government's recognition of Kent's status as the gateway to Europe, which places an additional burden of crime on the local police. However, is my hon Friend aware that some senior policemen in Kent believe that the criminal networks set up to bootleg alcohol and tobacco are now involved in smuggling illegal immigrants, pornography and drugs into the country? One senior officer has likened that trade to the evolution of organised crime in the United States in the early days of prohibition. Will my hon Friend ensure that he continues to monitor crime figures in Kent? Will he also ensure that Kent police have the money needed to combat this very worrying threat?	2000-01-17a.542.2	person/10347	person/10113	True	2000-01-17	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Crime Figures (Kent)	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2000-01-17.2.1	"I have indeed seen the letter to which the right hon and learned Gentleman refers. Given his experience, he will know that I have received similar letters from chairs of police authorities throughout the country and have discussed with delegations the


requirement for all police authorities at all times to secure future funding for their forces. I assure the right hon and learned Gentleman that we shall continue to keep these matters under close review. The basis of that review will be the outcomes of the policing that is taking place in every force throughout the country—how well their policing has impacted on recorded levels of crimes. In that context, I am confident that Kent will continue to show an improvement, because of its outstanding police force and the outstanding leadership that that police force has."	2000-01-17a.542.5	I share the Minister's hope that tomorrow's figures will show a further reduction in crime in Kent. Since 1994, crime in the county has reduced by 16 per cent. However, has the Minister had an opportunity to study last week's letter to the Home Secretary from the chairman of the Kent police authority? In it, she points out that the Home Secretary's decision on the funding of the radio project referred to in the previous question means that Kent police will face additional revenue costs of £3 million a year, and additional capital costs of more than £4 million a year. She says that that will have a damaging effect on future budgets for the Kent police, and on police manpower numbers. What impact does the Minister expect the additional financial pressures on the Kent police exerted by the crimes described by the hon Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman) to have on the future course of crime in the county, and on the police's ability to combat it?	2000-01-17a.542.4	person/10290	person/10113	False	2000-01-17	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Crime Figures (Kent)	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2000-01-17.3.0	I was delighted that the approvals that I mentioned earlier—including schemes from Southall town centre, Springbridge road and Acton town centre— bring investment in CCTV in my hon Friend's constituency to a total value of £644,000. There is no doubt that CCTV reduces crime, especially in areas such as secure car parks, where individual reductions of up to 80 per cent. have been achieved, and on housing estates, where CCTV can make a material difference to security. There is no doubt that it has an impact; we are investing far more than ever before, and I am delighted that the programme is being established strongly throughout the country.	2000-01-17a.543.4	I am grateful to the Minister for his reply. May I also thank him for his support for the borough of Ealing's application? Two bids have been approved to install more cameras in my constituency.

2000-01-17.4.0	My hon Friend has told me about the work of that residents scheme, and I am happy to commend it. Active communities and tenants and residents associations make a massive difference in reducing crime in many communities. The thrust of our crime reduction partnerships under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 is to link with initiatives such as those taken in my hon Friend's constituency and to bring resources to bear where they can make the greatest difference. In many crime reduction partnerships, community involvement makes a material difference in delivering results.	2000-01-17a.544.6	I welcome that reply, and my hon Friend's clear commitment to making our communities safer. What does my hon Friend have to say in praise of the Eastfield residents association?

I do not know whether any assessment was made of how much I would have cost the nation—or the economy—if those measures had been developed. Is it not better to spend money—as the Bill does—on electoral registration so as to ensure that it is fully achieved, rather than on measures that would destroy it?

police recruits over and above the number that will otherwise be recruited. The arrangements whereby the police pension costs form part of each police authority's budget are of long standing; they have some merits in ensuring that police forces concern themselves with, for example, the number of unnecessary medical retirements that they permit. However, I accept that those rising costs throughout the country are of great concern to the police service—as they are to me. That is why we are examining the longer-term future of the pension scheme."	2000-01-17a.546.7	I am grateful to the Secretary of State for that answer; it shows that the proportion of money spent on police pensions has almost doubled during that period. Does he recall the answer given to my hon Friend the Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) just before Christmas, which said that, this year, four police forces are seeing a reduction in real-terms spending? However, if we take out pensions spending, 14 police forces will see a reduction in real-terms spending. What does the right hon Gentleman intend to do about that?

I worked hard to try to stabilise the number of Metropolitan police officers, and, in the year that ended in March 1999, the reduction was not 2,000, but just 21.	2000-01-17a.547.1	May I begin by thanking Ministers, on behalf of the people of Penge, for the closed circuit television system? However, although it might reduce the amount of crime on the streets of Penge, I suspect that the residents will feel equally concerned about police numbers, and will be even more concerned when they realise what a large proportion of the Metropolitan police budget goes on pensions. I have listened with great care to the exchange between the Secretary of State and the hon Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel). Will the Home Secretary reassure me further that, when that fact is taken with the expenditure on radios to which reference has already been made, the people of Penge, and of Beckenham and the whole of London, will not see a reduction in front-line policing over time because of the costs of radio and pensions?	2000-01-17a.547.0	person/10662	person/10574	True	2000-01-17	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Police Pensions	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False

The problem that we are up against, to which we have found no solution, although we hope that one may be forthcoming, is that the initial costs—the funding costs— of a fully funded scheme are very substantial and that money would have to be found from somewhere.	2000-01-17a.547.3	Is it not an impossible situation when the proportion of police funding for pensions continues to increase? Although I welcome the fact that the Home Secretary has admitted that he will undertake a fundamental review of the matter, I urge him to adopt, at the earliest practical date, a fully funded pension scheme for the police service, and to introduce it gradually so that it will not disadvantage serving officers or reduce their pension expectations, but will, in the longer term, provide security for them and their families.	2000-01-17a.547.2	person/10636	person/10574	False	2000-01-17	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Police Pensions	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False

2000-01-17.8.0	I am grateful for that information and I am happy to join my hon Friend in congratulating the police in Eltham on the success of their initiative over Christmas. There are many examples of areas where such initiatives have worked very well, but I strongly agree with my hon Friend that the evidential basis of some of the material that is collected needs—and is being given— very careful examination and assessment.	2000-01-17a.549.0	I thank my hon Friend for that an answer. May I pass on the thanks of Greenwich council and Eltham police for the scheme that is being funded by the CCTV initiative? May I ask him to join me in congratulating Eltham police, who, by using a temporary scheme over Christmas, managed to arrest 10 individuals with the help of evidence that was gathered by camera, in a period when they would usually expect to arrest four or five individuals? Does he agree that this is vital step forward for the police, in that it will enable them to deploy resources more efficiently? However, there is some concern about the ownership of the evidence that is gathered. Does my hon Friend agree that, to secure public confidence in the long term, there needs to be a degree of openness and accountability about the evidence that is gathered by camera?	2000-01-17a.548.8	person/10185	person/10113	True	2000-01-17	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Closed Circuit Television	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2000-01-17.8.1	I can give the hon Gentleman that assurance. However, it might have been more in character with his usual graciousness had he acknowledged that the scheme in Bury St. Edmunds that we have announced today has been given to his constituency and is a step forward. It might also have been gracious for a former special adviser to a Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer to acknowledge that in this one year the Government have given more to CCTV schemes than was given in the whole of the last five years of the Conservative Government. I give the hon Gentleman the assurance that we shall consider carefully the bid for Stowmarket, a place which I travel through frequently on the train from Norwich to London. As I flash past, I shall try to glean what I can to assess the town's crime needs.	2000-01-17a.549.2	Is the Minister aware of a recent local crime prevention survey carried out in mid-Suffolk that shows that 90 per cent. of local residents in Stowmarket believe that the introduction of a CCTV scheme in that town centre would enhance local safety? Is he further aware that Mid Suffolk district council in my constituency is considering making a bid this year for the second round of challenge funding? In light of that, can the Minister assure me today that, on receipt of a bid, he will bear in mind the fact that Stowmarket is the only market town of its size in Suffolk without a CCTV scheme, and seriously consider giving Stowmarket the share of funding that it deserves under the challenge funding scheme?	2000-01-17a.549.1	person/10520	person/10113	False	2000-01-17	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Closed Circuit Television	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2000-01-17.8.2	"I very much agree with my hon Friend's points—indeed, a number of the schemes agreed and announced today are portable CCTV schemes. We are currently drawing up the guidelines for the next round in which I hope we shall announce results more regularly— every three months or whatever—than on a year-by-year basis. In the guidelines, we intend to give priority not only to portable CCTV schemes such as those that have been mentioned, but to schemes that focus on rural areas and

on parades in out-of-town estates, which have not always been at the top of priority lists. I hope that previous experience will inform the future programme, which remains very substantial over the next two or three years."	2000-01-17a.549.4	I congratulate my hon Friend on the Government's contribution to the introduction of CCTV throughout the community. However, may I press him for more portable CCTVs in communities? My own constituency is asking for such facilities, which would do a tremendous amount to reduce crime in Outwood and Stanley. Will my hon Friend tell us what provision for portable CCTV is made in the allocation to which he has referred?	2000-01-17a.549.3	person/10460	person/10113	False	2000-01-17	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Closed Circuit Television	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

It might be in keeping to acknowledge that the Government are trying to use this important weapon to reduce crime in a way that most Members on both sides of the House would acknowledge is beneficial.	2000-01-17a.550.1	Given the undoubted effectiveness of closed circuit television in preventing and reducing crime in this country, why do police force figures show that, in the first six months of the current financial year, recorded crime rose nationally by no less than 5 per cent?

2000-01-17.11.0	The police rightly give considerable priority to witness support and protection. We support them in that with the resources necessary to that end. More than that, it was this Government, as my hon Friend knows, who introduced the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 precisely in order to address the problem that he has identified, which manifests itself in magistrates courts, including in cases of domestic violence and neighbour disputes. It is very important to ensure, as we have, that magistrates courts have a battery of protection that they can extend to witnesses. Without such support, we shall be unable effectively to reduce crime in the way that we are determined to do.	2000-01-17a.552.5	I thank my right hon Friend for that reply. As I am sure he is aware, there is a very real and considerable problem of intimidation, not only of those who are victims as well as witnesses, but of witnesses, and not just in magistrates courts but in Crown courts. There are many and constant examples in my constituency. In a serious murder trial, for example, witnesses were literally in fear for their lives. The police do not have the resources to protect every witness, so in areas of my constituency there is a climate of fear: people dare not give evidence or give written statements for fear of reprisals. Will my right hon Friend please undertake to review witness support and, in particular, protection?	2000-01-17a.552.4	person/10608	person/10052	True	2000-01-17	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Witness Protection	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2000-01-17.11.1	The hon Gentleman makes a valid point. The security of magistrates courts, in relation to the protection of both victims and witnesses, can be enhanced enormously by proper layout and design—indeed, the number of escapes can be reduced by effective layout and design in cell and dock areas. We are liaising very closely with the Lord Chancellor's Department on existing and new build in order to ensure that we take such matters into account, to protect witnesses and victims and reduce the number of escapes in transit.	2000-01-17a.553.0	"The right hon Gentleman clearly and rightly takes this matter very seriously. Does he agree that witness intimidation hinders the good order and administration of honourable justice not only in murder cases, to which the hon Member for Brighton, Kemptown (Dr. Turner) drew the House's attention, but in lesser cases? Does the Minister also agree that the only way in which we can prevent that is by ensuring more people on the ground, better planning and


layout of magistrates courts and the provision of areas where people can be protected while waiting to give evidence?"	2000-01-17a.552.6	person/10555	person/10052	False	2000-01-17	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Witness Protection	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False

We work closely with the Judicial Studies Board, which, as she will appreciate, is an independent body. I assure her that the board, the Home Office and—important in this context— the Department of Health are well aware of the importance of ensuring that special needs are taken into account. That applies to learning disabilities. We have found that those who work for some of the charities engaged in work involving learning disabilities are very often the best people to provide such training. We are actively exploring that avenue in order to ensure that the judiciary gets the benefit of hearing from those who have to work at first hand with such problems. No one should be denied justice simply because they are living with a disability. That applies particularly to learning disability. All too often, people are led simply to dismiss the evidence of those who are grappling with disabilities—and doing so with great heroism and courage. Such people deserve, and will get, the full protection of the law.	2000-01-17a.553.2	As the chair of the all-party voice group, I know how welcome the new witness protection measures are to people with learning disabilities who have been victims of abuse.

We are providing additional funding to support those endeavours—I will be happy to write to the hon Gentleman with more details—but many of the decisions will be made at a local level and will be made far more transparent through the publication of a local offer in every council.	2014-07-21b.1130.0	The Minister is aware that there is a crisis up and down the country—whether in Peterborough or Huddersfield—as many schools do not have the capacity for early diagnosis and treatment.

He will know that the National Day Nurseries Association published research last year showing that the cost of child care had stabilised and was starting to come down. I am sure that he would therefore support our proposals for tax-free child care, which would allow parents to build up credit in accounts, which they could then spend in holidays or in term time as they feel appropriate, in line with the needs of their family.	2014-07-21b.1132.0	"As a fellow Leicestershire MP, may I welcome the right hon Lady to her promotion, which is well-deserved?

2014-07-21.4.1	I thank the hon Gentleman for that. As a working parent, I sympathise with all working parents about the availability and affordability of child care. This Government take that extremely seriously. I have mentioned tax-free child care, but we have also introduced shared parental leave and we are increasing child care support under universal credit. It should also be noted that the latest figures show that there are about 100,000 more child care places than there were in 2009.	2014-07-21b.1132.2	In welcoming the Secretary of State to her post, may I say that I am afraid she gave a rather complacent response to my hon Friend? This is not just about the affordability of child care; it is also about its availability, and the Government are failing on that, too. Figures from the Family and Childcare Trust show that the amount of holiday child care to help working parents has halved under this Government—for parents of disabled children the figure is even worse. Will she tell working parents in my constituency what real help this Government are going to give them, particularly as they face the reduction in summer holiday child care availability?	2014-07-21b.1132.1	person/11511	person/24732	True	2014-07-21	cameron	False	False	0	Education	Education	Child Care	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False
2014-07-21.4.2	May I thank my right hon Friend very much for her warm welcome? She is absolutely right to say that child care, which can be challenging at all times, can be particularly challenging during the holidays and especially when the six-week holiday period stretches out in front of families. The Government’s tax-free child care policy will extend to children up to the age of 12—it will extend up to the age of 17 for disabled children. That is why it is so very welcome and progress must be made on it—I know that my right hon Friend the Chancellor is doing that.	2014-07-21b.1132.4	I welcome my right hon Friend to her post. As a fellow working mum, she will know that school holidays can be a particularly challenging time for families when it comes to child care. I am particularly interested in her views on how the Government are supporting families with older children, as they can find it especially difficult to find the right sort of support during the summer holidays.	2014-07-21b.1132.3	person/11389	person/24732	False	2014-07-21	cameron	False	False	0	Education	Education	Child Care	0	conservative	True	False	conservative	True	False

The whole House will consider my right hon Friend’s promotion very well deserved. On child care, am I correct in thinking that
the Government will cover 85% of the child care costs of about 300,000 families receiving universal credit and are seeking to ensure that work always pays?"	2014-07-21b.1132.5	person/10023	person/24732	False	2014-07-21	cameron	False	False	0	Education	Education	Child Care	0	conservative	True	False	conservative	True	False
2014-07-21.4.4	I thank the hon Lady for her warm words. She will be aware, as a fellow working mum, that women are excellent at multitasking. Of course, as Secretary of State for Education, I am interested in child care and the whole range of issues that my Department will be dealing with as well as my brief as Minister for Women and Equalities. I look forward to continuing these debates with the hon Lady, as does the Minister who will be taking on the specific responsibility for child care. She is absolutely right that the holiday costs are very important and that is why we have increased the number of free hours of child care available as well as introducing tax-free child care, shared parental leave and policies on flexible working, all of which I am sure she welcomes.	2014-07-21b.1133.2	I, too, welcome the new Secretary of State to her position today. May I take it from the fact that she is answering the questions that she is now the child care Minister as well as Secretary of State and that despite her expanding ministerial team she has taken on those responsibilities? I am all for flexi-working, but given the challenge our country faces with its child care system I hope that she can focus full time on this issue. As other Members have said, the Family and Childcare Trust and Netmums have shown that the cost and availability of holiday child care are damaging the economy, with 1 million working days lost because parents cannot find or afford holiday child care to fit their needs. What does the Secretary of State say to parents being forced to take time off this summer, during this Parliament, because they cannot get the summer child care they need?	2014-07-21b.1133.1	person/25165	person/24732	False	2014-07-21	cameron	False	False	0	Education	Education	Child Care	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False

“alter the character and ethos of schools”.

As a result of his campaigning and that of many other hon Members we are introducing the fairer funding system next year. When we consulted on this, Northumberland was initially going to benefit to the tune of £10.6 million. I can say that the final settlement is that Northumberland will receive £12 million more to ensure that it is funded fairly in the future.	2014-07-21b.1134.2	A school funding revolution is taking place in Northumberland as the fairer funding consultation will lead to an increase in April 2015 of up to 7.2%. That is also a revolution for our governors, who, under the previous Government, were often consulted but always ignored.

That is what the free schools programme is all about—new schools set up in response to local parental demand, delivering strong discipline and high academic standards.	2014-07-21b.1135.7	My constituency is one of the fastest growing boroughs in London. We currently have one free school, which is performing well, according to parents. School places are my biggest local issue.

Of those, 24% are graded outstanding, which is a staggering achievement for a school that has been open for just four or five terms. This represents a higher proportion than other schools. Some 71% of free schools are graded good or outstanding.
We would certainly welcome an application for a new free school in Deal if there is evidence of a need for more good school places."	2014-07-21b.1135.9	The Minister will be aware that free schools are very popular with parents and achieve results that outperform many maintained schools.

I would be interested to have his assessment over a coffee some time of his old boss versus his new boss.
As the Minister will be aware, Ofsted said that at one school, children’s reading ability had regressed, and of another school that
“too many pupils are in danger of leaving the school without being able to read and write properly.”
This was Ofsted’s report on two free schools.

That is not what is happening with the academies and free schools programme.	2014-07-21b.1136.4	The Government’s policy on free schools is in free fall.

There is always a balance to be struck between ensuring that the funding is fair and ensuring that no institution has the rug pulled from under it. It is a balance that we are determined to achieve.	2014-07-21b.1138.2	The Minister is right to remind the Opposition that they had 13 years to put right the anomaly, but we have had four years.

I listened to what he just said and cannot disagree with any of it. Even the CBI says that 52% of respondents to a recent survey say that schools must teach pupils about work-based skills.

That is how we will get our young people into work.	2014-07-21b.1139.4	I, too, welcome the Secretary of State and her new Ministers to their posts. The UK Commission for Employment and Skills has found that young people who have four or more work experience activities during their education are five times less likely to fall into the category of NEET—not in education, employment or training—in later life, yet work experience placements have declined by 15% on this Government’s watch.

When will she make the break and put the interests of parents and pupils above those of Tory party ideology?	2014-07-21b.1143.2	person/24850	person/24732	False	2014-07-21	cameron	False	True	2	Education	Education	Topical Questions	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False
2014-07-21.17.2	My hon Friend is absolutely right to say that educational standards on the Isle of Wight are unacceptably low. That is why, in July 2013, the previous Secretary of State issued a direction notice to Isle of Wight council to improve standards. My hon Friend will know that Hampshire is now the island’s strategic partner, and that it is making good progress with the schools on the island. However, the Department for Education and all its Ministers will be keeping a close eye on the island to ensure that standards continue to improve.	2014-07-21b.1144.1	Only one of the six secondary schools on the Isle of Wight, Christ the King, has been judged good by Ofsted.

2014-07-21.17.3	We want to see a strong network of children’s centres in place across the country, offering families access to a wide range of local, flexible services. In fact, a recent survey showed that, under this Government, a record number of parents—more than 1 million—were now using children’s centres, and that the centres were reaching more than 90% of families in need. I guess that listening to the views of families is what is important here.	2014-07-21b.1144.3	The Government’s own figures show that there are nearly 600 fewer children’s centres than there were at the time of the last election. According to the charity 4Children, a further 100 children’s centres are under threat of imminent closure as a result of cuts by this Government. Will the new Minister take the necessary action to halt the decline in the number of children’s centres and to remove the threat to services that are relied on by so many families and children?	2014-07-21b.1144.2	person/24905	person/24789	False	2014-07-21	cameron	False	True	0	Education	Education	Topical Questions	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False

This is the biggest move towards fair funding across England in a decade, and it is long overdue. It should have taken place under the previous Government, and it will take place under this one.	2014-07-21b.1144.5	I welcome the Government’s positive approach in creating a fairer funding formula for schools. That will mean that pupils in Macclesfield will be receiving a £125 cash boost.

2014-07-21.17.5	I think the hon Lady should talk to those on her Front Bench, as well as to her colleagues in the previous Labour Government who started this whole process by legislating on social work practices. We have been clear, following the consultation, that there will be non-profit organisations running children’s services but also that the same levels of accountability and oversight will apply as a consequence. She needs to look carefully at the detail and talk to her Front Benchers about what their position is.	2014-07-21b.1145.0	"I was glad to read in the newspapers that the Minister had finally abandoned plans to allow firms such as G4S to run child protection services, but then I looked more closely and discovered that he now intends to allow those firms
to set up not-for-profit subsidiaries that would run those services anyway. That would mean that the same firm could place a child into a care home and run that care home, and not be inspected by Ofsted. How on earth can the Minister think that that would be good for children?"	2014-07-21b.1144.6	person/24831	person/14128	False	2014-07-21	cameron	False	True	0	Education	Education	Topical Questions	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False

The vast majority of schools are on track to deliver it successfully in September, and we continue to work with the small minority that have further work to do.	2014-07-21b.1145.2	Schools across Norfolk will every day serve an extra 21,000 free school meals to infant-aged children from September.

We want to look at the outcomes, not to be obsessed always with the structures and the people.	2014-07-21b.1145.4	Many parents across Leicester, and I dare say across Loughborough too, do not think it unreasonable to expect teachers to be qualified.

They are subject to more oversight than maintained schools from the Department for Education and the Education Funding Agency.	2014-07-21b.1147.0	The current problems in Birmingham academies and my experiences of Byrchall high in my constituency lead me to believe that the last Secretary of State left academy schools completely unaccountable.

In light of the massive budget cuts announced in the Department, can he assure me that there will be no threat to the measures that the then Government introduced and, indeed, confirm that the Government have no plans to reverse the further powers that Labour has given to councils to introduce local licensing schemes, because in my experience, in my constituency, people want more regulation, not less?	2010-06-10d.446.6	person/24710	person/11917	True	2010-06-10	cameron	False	False	0	Communities And Local Government	Communities And Local Government	Private Rented Housing	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False

I referred in the previous Parliament to the system being akin to Soviet-style planning, and it certainly put constraints on the development of housing in my North Durham constituency.

2010-06-10.5.2	The hon Gentleman, who is experienced in these matters, well knows the dire financial straits the country is in and the need for all sectors to save money. However, he ought to put that in the context of what we have had to do because of the legacy of his party's Government. We have taken steps to protect formula grant, to un-ring-fence a good deal of grant to give local authorities more financial flexibility and to remove burdens such as the expensive comprehensive area assessment inspection regime.	2010-06-10d.449.7	Regarding today's written statement, does the Minister not accept that local authorities have been at the forefront of making efficiency savings-2% year on year-so to ask for a further 1% part way through the year, on top of the 2% to which they are already committed, will effectively mean cuts in local authority spending part way through the year of about 4% to 5%? Rather than being about efficiency savings, this is surely the first round of the savage cuts for local authorities that Ministers promised us.	2010-06-10d.449.6	person/10045	person/13736	False	2010-06-10	cameron	False	False	0	Communities And Local Government	Communities And Local Government	Local Authority Funding	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False

It is important that we respect those rights to tenure as well.	2010-06-10d.451.4	"Why did the Conservative manifesto commit only to ""respect"" the rights of social tenants, not to protect them, as the Minister has previously stated?"	2010-06-10d.451.3	person/24774	person/11917	True	2010-06-10	cameron	False	False	0	Communities And Local Government	Communities And Local Government	Shorthold Tenancies	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False

But I can reassure him that we will do all that we can to undo the mess of the lowest level of house building since 1946, which my right hon Friend the Secretary of State mentioned. Indeed, if one takes out the war years, it is the lowest since 1924. That is the heart of the problem with house building in this country. Leaving us with a bill-it is highly dubious whether £780 million of it is available to the Government-was not the smartest thing to do, and it means that we are in the position of trying to rescue house building in this country, and, in particular, affordable house building.	2010-06-10d.452.2	"I welcome the right hon Gentleman to one of the best jobs in government. All of us who are passionate about housing are disappointed that the new Government have downgraded housing and that the Housing Minister no longer attends Cabinet. On homelessness, does he accept that co-ordination is fine, but we need to build more new affordable housing to tackle the problem? Some £230 million of cuts this year is a bad start. When the £6 billion of cuts were first announced, the right hon Member for Yeovil (Mr Laws) , the then Chief Secretary to the Treasury, told the House that the Government were
""putting more money than the previous Government did into social housing.""-[ Official Report, 26 May 2010; Vol. 510, c. 160 .]

It has never been done before at ministerial level; it has always been left to the officials. We will have Ministers in charge of homelessness across the Government, including in the MOD.	2010-06-10d.452.4	As a significant proportion of those who are long-term homeless are ex-servicemen and women, will the ministerial team also liaise with the Ministry of Defence to ensure that these people are properly supported as they make the transition from service to civilian life?	2010-06-10d.452.3	person/24938	person/11917	False	2010-06-10	cameron	False	False	0	Communities And Local Government	Communities And Local Government	Homelessness	0	conservative	True	False	conservative	True	False
2010-06-10.9.0	The hon Gentleman is absolutely right that there are numerous problems with how the housing revenue account operates at the moment, in England as well as in Wales. The simplest answer that I can give him is that I agree, and we will continue the review.	2010-06-10d.453.1	Is the Minister aware that Welsh local authorities returned more than £80 million to the Treasury as a consequence of the scheme last year, and that my home local authority, Carmarthenshire county council, which has retained its stock, returned £5.5 million in 2008-09? Does he agree therefore that the scheme does not provide a level playing field between local authorities and housing associations, and that it would be far fairer for moneys to be retained locally to increase investment in public housing, help Welsh local authorities to achieve the Welsh housing quality standards and help to create jobs in the local economy?	2010-06-10d.453.0	person/24743	person/11917	True	2010-06-10	cameron	False	False	0	Communities And Local Government	Communities And Local Government	Housing Revenue Account	0	plaid-cymru	False	False	conservative	True	False
2010-06-10.9.1	I would be happy to receive a delegation from the council on the issue. It is absolutely the case that it is not fair.

That must be fixed, in the interests not only of transparency and of the tenants within those authorities that are paying in, but of efficiency. I would be very happy to meet my hon Friend and his colleagues.	2010-06-10d.453.3	Kettering council, on which I serve, collects £12 million a year from its council tenants, £3 million of which is handed straight over to Her Majesty's Treasury.

Could he possibly tell me how he intends to find the money to help social housing?

He has a great team of civil servants, and it was a privilege to work with them. I congratulate also the new Housing Minister on his promotion, but it is a real shame that he, along with the Prime Minister and, this week, the Chancellor, should choose to use their first appearances at the Dispatch Box to give such inaccurate information about the housing pledge that the previous Government announced two years ago. The Housing Minister knows full well that the costs were agreed with the Treasury and would have been met with £340 million from capital under-spends in other Departments and £540 million in greater departmental flexibilities. If that had not been the case, the Government's accounting officer would have prevented us from making the announcement.

That is what we are doing.	2010-06-10d.455.6	Why did Ministers not make an announcement about the first £230 million of cuts to the affordable housing investment programme instead of sneaking them out on the Homes and Communities Agency website? Do they not accept that the hardest-hit areas are the poorest, and that the poorest families will be hit first? Given that the Prime Minister said this week that the Government's cuts will be open, responsible and fair, can the Minister not see that that fails each one of those three tests?	2010-06-10d.455.4	person/10268	person/10578	False	2010-06-10	cameron	False	False	0	Communities And Local Government	Communities And Local Government	Affordable Housing	1	labour	False	True	liberal-democrat	False	False

The right hon Gentleman operated an extremely effective burnt earth policy within the Department. He left a legacy in which the cupboard was bare. All that was missing was a note of apology. The cuts that we have had to make have been imposed on us by him. We have managed to ensure that formula grant has not been touched and that no authority will face a revenue cut greater than 2%. That is much better than the £50 billion of unallocated cuts that was the legacy left to our Department."	2010-06-10d.459.0	I welcome the Secretary of State to his post.

However, the hon Gentleman must understand that we are in this position only because of the inheritance that we received. We had to take that money out, and if we had not done so, the prospect of our being able to provide sensible accommodation for Gypsies and Travellers would have been diminished, because of the profligacy of the Labour party.	2010-06-10d.464.0	There is a need for a more strategic view of how we can have Gypsy and Traveller encampments around the country, as well as in specific regions, but how can we do that when the Government have just cut the budget for the Gypsies and Travellers programme by £30 million?	2010-06-10d.463.1	person/13933	person/10477	False	2010-06-10	cameron	False	True	0	Communities And Local Government	Communities And Local Government	Topical Questions	2	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False
2002-05-09.0.0	"The question is, ""What will benefit families in all regions of the country?"" There is no doubt that the combination of the changes in child benefit through the new child tax credit and the increased resources available to the NHS means that the quality of life of all families is better. I am pleased that more than 90 per cent. of families will benefit from the child tax credit and that we will have been able to inject, by 2007–08, an additional £40 billion into the NHS. We will invest that money: other parties would make cuts."	2002-05-09.255.10	I thank my right hon Friend for that answer. Does he agree that the child benefit reforms will help to eradicate child poverty, and that the announcements of increased health spending will mean that it will amount to 9 per cent. of national income? Is not that good news for hard-working families in the north-east and for families everywhere who rely on a health service that is free at the point of delivery?	2002-05-09.255.9	person/11003	person/10068	True	2002-05-09	blair	False	False	0	Treasury	Treasury	Budget	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2002-05-09.0.1	This is another proposal from the Liberal Democrats that one suspects would cost some additional sums of money. If the hon Gentleman wishes to abolish the council tax in its entirety, he will have to replace it with something else. As for lower-income families, those in the bottom 20 per cent. are £2,400 a year better off as a result of all the measures that we have taken. The hon Gentleman should start to recognise that the working families tax credit means, for the first time in our history, that those families are subject to a negative tax rate. They are better off as a result. The measure helps people to get back into work. In addition, the child tax credit means that we are relieving people from poverty. Those are exactly the measures that I wish the Liberal party would support.	2002-05-09.256.1	Is the Chancellor aware that, for the north-west, the north-east and other regions of the country, new figures from the Office for National Statistics show that the poorest families pay a higher percentage of their income in tax than the richest families? The poorest 20 per cent of families pay 41.2 per cent. of their income in tax, compared with the 35.5 per cent. paid by the richest 20 per cent. of families. Does the right hon Gentleman acknowledge that that is due primarily to the burden of council tax and indirect tax? When will he do something about that? When is he going to reform—indeed, abolish—council tax?	2002-05-09.256.0	person/10155	person/10068	False	2002-05-09	blair	False	False	0	Treasury	Treasury	Budget	0	liberal-democrat	False	False	labour	True	False
2002-05-09.0.2	"I am grateful to the hon Gentleman, and I enjoyed my visit to Northern Ireland last week, when his concerns were among the issues that were raised. The working families tax credit is, for 400,000 more people than was the case with family credit, a benefit for families with children that goes with working. Increased numbers of people therefore receive that benefit.
As the hon Gentleman rightly says, the advertising and publicity of the benefits are important. When the children's tax credit was introduced, the surrounding publicity meant that the uptake was far higher than when family credit was first introduced. Equally, when we introduce the child credit and the pension credit next year, we will be telling people of their rights so that they, too, can claim the benefit. Opposition parties opposed the minimum wage and now have to accept it. They opposed the working families tax credit and then—at the election, at least—accepted it. They opposed the children's tax credit and then had to accept it. In the same way, over time they will have to accept the pension credit, the child tax credit and the new employment credit."	2002-05-09.256.3	Does the Chancellor agree that even his best efforts to improve the lot of those on lowest incomes cannot be delivered unless there is uptake of benefits?

Thank goodness that we have got away from the situation that existed under the Tories, when child poverty rose and there were 4 million children in poverty in this country. Child poverty trebled under the Conservatives. The right hon and learned Gentleman in particular should be ashamed of his record as Secretary of State for Employment, when unemployment went up by 1 million.	2002-05-09.257.1	Given his last three answers, is the Chancellor proud of the fact that the Budget was redistributive?	2002-05-09.257.0	person/10290	person/10068	False	2002-05-09	blair	False	False	4	Treasury	Treasury	Budget	3	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False

Perhaps he should be telling the shadow Chancellor that the Conservative party should change its position on the Budget.	2002-05-09.258.4	I thank the Chancellor for that extremely courteous reply. However, is he aware that in my constituency, the Queen Elizabeth hospital is facing serious shortages of radiologists, radiographers and nurses? Given that inflation in the NHS is running at 4.5 per cent., that 45 per cent of its budget goes on wages, that many employees who will be worse off as a result of the Budget will want inflation-busting pay increases, and that the NHS, as an employer, will have to pay out much more in national insurance contributions, what guarantee can the right hon Gentleman give my local hospital that the much-needed resources will go to patient care?

2002-05-09.1.1	"As my hon Friend knows, side by side with the Budget were the proposed reforms of the national health service that were agreed by the Secretary of State for Health and announced by him the next day. One set of proposals covers statutory audit, statutory inspection, the statutory right of patients to make complaints and for them to be dealt with independently, an annual report that has to be published each year for Parliament by an independent regulator of the health service, as well as local reports and prospectuses that must be published by each health authority. Information, the power to scrutinise and to carry out proper audit of the use of money, is enshrined in the way in which the health service works for the first time in its history. Equally, we have set national standards but are giving hospitals locally, through rewards for better performance, incentives to do better.
I believe that the combination of those factors as well as dealing with the performance of failing hospitals means that we will secure value for money. I hope that we can restore in this country the consensus on the national health service that existed for 50 years but has unfortunately been broken by the Opposition."	2002-05-09.258.6	"I am sure that my right hon Friend will recall the Wanless report concluding:

However, we welcome the money that is being put into the NHS and the fact that the Government have at last admitted the obvious—that saving the NHS needed investment, which needed tax rises.
Did the Chancellor honestly have no idea that tax rises were necessary when he fought a general election campaign just a year ago? If he did know, why did he not have the courage to put that to the electorate so that they could choose the tax rise rather than have the Chancellor choose it after the election?

We also know that in every major health care system in the world employers as well as employees make a contribution. The contribution of 1 per cent. from employers and employees is, in our view, the fairest way of going about funding the health service for the long term.
I am pleased that almost all political parties in the House, including the Liberals, support a health service free at the point of need.

2002-05-09.1.4	Once again, the hon Gentleman, who is also a member of the Treasury Committee, does not conduct his research properly, despite the fact that he was a political adviser— [Interruption.] —probably because of the fact that he used to be a political adviser to the Conservative Government who failed to be re-elected. As was pointed out to him at the Select Committee, the costings for the NHS are given up to 2007–08. It is stated that, prior to the spending plans being set in the 2004 spending review, the fiscal projections assume departmental expenditure limit growth after 2005–06 of 2.5 per cent. in real terms, supplemented by an addition to allow for the five-year health settlement. That should answer the hon Gentleman's question—as he should have known before he put it.	2002-05-09.260.0	The Budget's fiddled assumptions can no longer conceal the £7 billion black hole in the Chancellor's NHS spending figure for five years' time.

2002-05-09.1.5	It is absolutely correct that the national insurance change means that pensioners do not have to pay the tax rise. People who have served the community all their lives and who need the national health service will not have to make the additional contribution that they would have to make if there were an income tax rise. The shadow Chancellor who lives in Truro, as opposed to the shadow Chancellor who lives in Folkestone, must face up to the fact that he spends all his time going around the country talking about local decision making, but he wants to abolish the local taxation available to local councils through council tax. It is time that the Liberals thought out their policy before announcing it.	2002-05-09.260.2	Does my right hon Friend agree that when the Liberals open their mouths, we expect them to talk as their belly warms? On this occasion, they have already announced that they want to get rid of council tax at a cost of several billion pounds. They have been very revealing. Will my right hon Friend comment on their policy? Would he adopt it? They have just announced that it would be a good idea to raise money for the national health service by increasing income tax.

If Conservative Members no longer believe in a health service free at the point of need, they must tell us which charges they would introduce, who would have to pay private health insurance and what they would charge to visit GPs and hospitals.

Does the Chancellor recall that the Secretary of State for Health stated that public service agreements
""set out the concrete improvements to be delivered in return for the extra investment we are making""?—[ Official Report, 24 June 1999; Vol. 333, c. 458W .] Those 1999 agreements did not deliver concrete improvements, unless the Chancellor thinks that the extraordinary record of more administrators than hospital beds is an improvement.

2002-05-09.2.0	My hon Friend is right. Progress is being made in international co-operation against tax evasion. The OECD issued its conclusions in June 2000 and asked all countries to agree to produce information where tax evasion was an issue. Since then, most countries, including all our dependent territories and our overseas territories, have agreed to produce that information. Seven countries remain unco-operative, and they were named in April this year. In addition, we want to ensure not just information on request, but the exchange of information as the basis of future tax policy. That is why we are making progress with the savings directive, among other things, in the European Union. We will continue, as we did in the Budget, to take further measures as necessary to tackle tax evasion.	2002-05-09.261.5	I thank my right hon Friend for that reply. I also applaud the Government for the measures they are proposing in the Finance Bill to deal with tax evaders abroad. There are principally two kinds of people who use offshore tax havens: terrorists, such as al-Qaeda, who seek to destroy government by violent means; and multinational corporations, such as News Corporation, which seek to undermine government by not paying for it. Is my right hon Friend satisfied with the international co-operation that he has received on this matter? We need to do a lot more about both those groups.	2002-05-09.261.4	person/10790	person/10068	True	2002-05-09	blair	False	False	0	Treasury	Treasury	Offshore Tax Havens	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

As for the savings directive, however, which requests the automatic exchange of information, I hope that all the dependent territories and all the overseas territories that are affected will agree to play their part in exchanging information on an automatic basis so that we can make progress on the directive. In case they do not, I have taken measures in the Budget announcements last month whereby we will take action if they remain unable to help us.	2002-05-09.262.0	Will the Chancellor give an assurance that Her Majesty's Government will maintain the fiscal autonomy of the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands—if need be, against the European Union? May I remind him that the Isle of Man balances its budget by law and has a rate of unemployment of less than 1 per cent.? Were it not to have fiscal autonomy, it would be a drain on the British taxpayer, rather than the contrary.	2002-05-09.261.6	person/10636	person/10068	False	2002-05-09	blair	False	False	0	Treasury	Treasury	Offshore Tax Havens	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2002-05-09.2.2	"Those are two separate issues. On tax havens, because of the events of 11 September , many countries are very keen to move forward with the exchange of information as the basis on which we can reach agreements about how we deal with tax evasion, as well as money laundering and tracking terrorists' finances. The United Kingdom has agreed that it would be the first country to be subject to international surveillance of the measures that we have taken in that area. I hope that other countries will agree that international surveillance of what they do is very much part of an international system of co-operation to deal with tax evasion. We are taking action on those matters.
On the issue of tax on speculation, my hon Friend knows well that the proposals put forward by Professor Tobin were in an era when there was not the liberalisation of currency markets that exists now. Most people would find that while it is worth looking again at whether Professor Tobin's proposals could have a beneficial effect, it is very difficult to implement them. The key question on international aid is whether we can raise the money that is necessary with or without a Tobin tax, so that we can deal with the problems of the third world, particularly education and health. The Government's proposals for a new deal in this matter, involving £50 billion extra in overseas aid, are the best way forward. At the end of the day, national Governments must make the decisions about what they are going to do."	2002-05-09.262.2	How far has international co-operation extended since 11 September on offshore tax havens?

2002-05-09.3.0	"If the Conservative party is suggesting that the public sector should somehow be exempt from national insurance contributions, that is an extraordinary proposition. When the Conservatives increased employees' contributions 10 times and employers' contributions five times, I do not remember them ever addressing the question of the impact on the public sector. The money will be found from within the additional resources that we are making available—departmental expenditure limits are increasing by £19.5 billion.
The hon Gentleman makes a fair point about hospices, which make an invaluable contribution across the country and in many of our constituencies. As part of the spending review, there will be a cross-cutting review of the role of the voluntary sector in the delivery, and in assisting the delivery, of public services. I shall ensure that that examines the position of hospices."	2002-05-09.263.4	Will the Chief Secretary confirm that, according to the House of Commons Library, within those figures £217 million of the increase in national insurance contributions relates to the national health service? On the public sector generally, does he expect that higher employers' national insurance bills in the public sector will be financed by Departments or passed on to public sector workers in the form of lower pay settlements? Can he explain to me specifically how hospices up and down the country will cope with the big increases in national insurance contributions, given that they are run by the voluntary sector and largely on voluntary contributions? They will not, therefore, be the beneficiaries of his supposed NHS largesse.	2002-05-09.263.3	person/10371	person/10545	True	2002-05-09	blair	False	False	0	Treasury	Treasury	National Insurance Contributions	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False

On the impact on the service sector, I remind the hon Gentleman that for the average small business, the rise in national insurance contributions is substantially offset by cuts in corporation tax.	2002-05-09.264.0	The service sector of industry employs a huge number of people. As the service sector is not made more profitable by an increase in employers' national insurance contributions, is it fair to say that this sector is one of the major net losers?

First, I spoke to two policemen in Newark who doubt that, with the increase in national insurance contributions, they will be able to continue serving in the police force. Secondly, I spoke to nurses in Tuxford—not surgeons or doctors but the lowest-paid of the national health service workers—one of whom said to me that the Chancellor's catchphrase should not have been ""Enterprise and fairness"" but ""Physician heal thyself""."	2002-05-09.264.1	person/11109	person/10545	True	2002-05-09	blair	False	False	0	Treasury	Treasury	National Insurance Contributions	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2002-05-09.3.3	I certainly am. It is already a well-established commitment of the Government that health inequalities are a key priority. Indeed, analysing those factors featured large in the Wanless report. It is therefore crucial that resources go into prevention, community health and primary care, as they will do as a consequence of the extra £40 billion that we are making available over the next five years. In addition, we have the benefits of the working families tax credit, the child tax credit, the new deal and our other policies for sustaining high employment. As we all know, unemployment and poverty have long been a big factor in the health inequalities to which my hon Friend refers. The Labour party is committed to tackling them while the Conservative party, which is unable to come here with any credible policies on health, would allow them to get worse, just as they allowed inequalities to worsen when they were in government.	2002-05-09.264.4	"I represent one of the largest groups of NHS workers outside London. They all say, ""Yes, we will pay more national insurance but, for goodness sake, get on and tackle the health inequalities that mean that people in the north-east of England live seven to 10 years less than people in the south-east of England."" The direct and indirect costs of those health inequalities far outweigh the direct costs of 1 per cent. on national insurance. Is my right hon Friend the Chief Secretary getting that message too?"	2002-05-09.264.3	person/10137	person/10545	False	2002-05-09	blair	False	False	0	Treasury	Treasury	National Insurance Contributions	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2002-05-09.3.4	"My hon Friend is right. The CBI pointed out that ill-health costs business in this country £10 billion a year. Even after this increase in national insurance contributions, business in this country will contribute on average £10 a week towards health care, compared with £60 a week in France and £30 a week in Germany. The contributions in this country are fair and, as my hon Friend said, they will be welcomed by people in the business community. Anthony Stone of the British Chambers of Commerce said about the Budget:
""Any of us in business know that we get what we pay for. If we want a world class health service in the UK we need to pay more.""
I believe that that message is well understood in business."	2002-05-09.265.0	My right hon Friend will be aware that my constituency of Wimbledon has one of the highest proportions of professional and managerial people in the work force. There is a high degree of support for the Budget measures, because people understand and support the fact that money will be spent on rebuilding the NHS. Is it not the case that, even with the increase in national insurance contributions, Britain is still in a much more competitive position than some of our major competitors such as France and Germany? Is it not also the case that we are taking a number of measures to boost productivity and competitiveness? Finally, is it not the case that when we see the changes that the investment in the NHS will bring, we will find even more support from people in the work force for these measures than we find today so soon after the Budget?	2002-05-09.264.5	person/10094	person/10545	False	2002-05-09	blair	False	False	0	Treasury	Treasury	National Insurance Contributions	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

We also pledged that we would put schools and hospitals first and that we would put investment in our public services ahead of the cuts in taxation for which the right hon and learned Gentleman and his colleagues were arguing. They cannot have any credibility in the House when they say that the national health service needs more resources but oppose our measures to raise them. We have introduced reforms to match those resources, but they say that they have no alternative.

We are certainly not about to embark on a running commentary on the progress that is being made.	2002-05-09.266.2	Does the Minister acknowledge that the Treasury's model shows that a 10 per cent. change in the exchange rate is the equivalent of 50,000 or 60,000 jobs in tourism alone? Does she agree with the assessment of the president of the German Bundesbank, who was in London last week, that the pound is over-valued and will have to be devalued before Britain can join the European monetary union?

2002-05-09.4.1	I am glad that my hon Friend recognises the importance of the five economic tests and that any decision on the euro will be taken in the best interests of Britain's national economy. Of course we are concerned about businesses and, in particular, manufacturing in my hon Friend's constituency, which is similar to my own in many respects. That is why we are the party that is taking action to support manufacturing; why we are cutting corporation tax; and why we have made permanent 40 per cent. first year capital allowances for plant and machinery for small and medium-sized enterprises. It is also why we have reformed capital gains tax to ensure that this country is the best in the world for entrepreneurship and enterprise. The Budget went further by implementing research and development investment tax credits, and it will provide a platform for growth on which businesses can thrive.	2002-05-09.266.4	Does my hon Friend recognise that in a constituency such as Burnley, where 36 per cent. of jobs are in manufacturing industry, there are concerns about the value of the pound against the euro? Manufacturing industry has to fix the price of its goods—and sell them—in euros and believes that it is important to join the euro as soon as possible. That would reduce instability and provide security and jobs, although obviously we need to join at the right rate and meet the economic tests.	2002-05-09.266.3	person/10479	person/10332	False	2002-05-09	blair	False	False	0	Treasury	Treasury	Exchange Rate	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

The best way to achieve a stable and competitive exchange rate, to which we are, of course, committed, is to have a framework for monetary policy that removes the political control of setting interest rates and gives it to the Monetary Policy Committee at the Bank of England. It also needs a fiscal framework that keeps debt under control, something that the Conservatives manifestly failed to do during their years in power.	2002-05-09.267.0	May I point out to the hon Lady that the five economic tests do not include an examination of the exchange rate, which is what the question is about? What is the reaction of her Treasury colleagues and her former colleagues in the Bank of England to the fact that economists at home and abroad almost unanimously argue that before Britain can practically think of joining the single European currency, the pound sterling will have to be devalued by between 20 and 30 per cent?	2002-05-09.266.5	person/10583	person/10332	False	2002-05-09	blair	False	False	0	Treasury	Treasury	Exchange Rate	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2002-05-09.4.3	I thank my hon Friend for pointing out something that we recognise: some difficulties experienced by manufacturers are caused by the weakness of the euro. In fact, sterling has depreciated against the dollar since 1997. We are committed to a stable economic framework in this country and I have set out the policies that we have put in place to ensure that we have one. As a result, the number of people in employment has increased by 1.5 million since 1997, we have the lowest inflation rate since the 1960s, and the lowest interest rates since 1964. I am sure that my hon Friend agrees that we have a platform for sustained economic growth.	2002-05-09.267.2	Does my hon Friend accept that not just the pound but the dollar is overvalued? I am sure that she is aware of speculation in the past week that both the pound and dollar are not only over-valued but likely to depreciate significantly in the coming months and perhaps for the next year or two. Does she agree that that would put enormous pressure on an already deflated eurozone economy, probably force nations in the eurozone to break through the boundaries of the growth and stability pact, and force a fundamental rethink of economic policy in the eurozone?	2002-05-09.267.1	person/10288	person/10332	False	2002-05-09	blair	False	False	0	Treasury	Treasury	Exchange Rate	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

We are determined to create a platform of macro-economic stability in this country and have introduced policies to make that programme work. We are committed to maintaining a framework that does just that.	2002-05-09.267.4	In addition to the president of the Bundesbank, two members of the Monetary Policy Committee, Christopher Allsopp and Sushil Wadhwani, have recently said that the pound is overvalued and that devaluation is necessary. They say that that could work and need not be as disruptive as the Treasury fears.

2002-05-09.4.5	I think that my right hon Friend will agree that the best thing that we can do for manufacturers is to have economic stability in this country. Once we have a platform of economic stability we can build on it by promoting competition, productivity and enterprise. That is why the Budget set out measures to support manufacturing and introduced a generous volume-based research and development tax credit for large companies, building on work that has already been done to support small companies. That is also why the Budget included exemptions for capital gains on substantial shareholdings in trading companies; why we have increased funding for regional development agencies so that they can act as drivers for growth and productivity throughout the regions; and why we are determined to tackle gaps in the market for finance by setting up regional venture capital funds across the country. Those are the conditions that manufacturers need to thrive and grow but, most important of all, we must avoid a return to the days of boom and bust that manufacturers had to endure for a long time under the Conservatives.	2002-05-09.268.1	Does my hon Friend accept that a fall in the value of the pound against the euro would give an enormous boost to manufacturers in the north-east, which is striving to achieve the Government's target of full employment in every region?

In the longer term, measures that we have put in place will increase productivity growth. I point out to him that the only year in which productivity fell in this country was when his party was in power.	2002-05-09.268.3	In view of what the Minister has just said about manufacturing, why has the rate of productivity been falling ever since Labour took office?	2002-05-09.268.2	person/10560	person/10332	False	2002-05-09	blair	False	False	0	Treasury	Treasury	Exchange Rate	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False

That is what we are doing.	2002-05-09.268.5	Does the Minister accept that an artificial devaluation of the pound would make imports more expensive and thus be inflationary? Does she accept that the real problem is the fact that the euro has collapsed in value, and that that is hardly a sign of success?

He will be glad to know that the total amount given to local authorities in civil defence grants increased by 36 per cent. in 2001–02, rising from £14 million in 2001 to £19 million in 2001–02. That is a substantial increase. Where there are specific issues in relation to the administration of the civil defence grant, that is a matter for my right hon and hon Friends in the Cabinet Office, but I shall certainly draw to their attention the concerns that my hon Friend expressed.	2002-05-09.270.5	I thank my right hon Friend for that answer and welcome the previous increases on the low base that we inherited from the last Government. However, in evidence to the Select Committee on Defence, local authority representatives claimed that there was a 15 per cent. cut this year for English local authorities, and Portsmouth is receiving a reduction of 5 per cent., from £78,000 to £74,000.

In Staffordshire, the fire service co-ordinates the emergency service for all the district councils, Staffordshire county council and Stoke-on-Trent city council, and we now have only seven full-time emergency planning officers. This year, the amount available was settled only in April, meaning that people are now employed on temporary contracts. May I urge my right hon Friend to tell the Cabinet Office that we need certainty for local authority spending during the next five years so that we can rely on our fire service and its officers to provide the emergency service that we all know is needed after 11 September ?	2002-05-09.271.1	person/10619	person/10052	False	2002-05-09	blair	False	False	0	Treasury	Treasury	Local Authorities (Emergency Planning)	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

Of course we recognise the impact of the slowdown in the world economy, the weakness of the euro and the tragic events of 11 September . In fact, since 1997 the value of the pound has depreciated against the dollar, and American tourists, who are so vital to certain aspects of the tourist industry, should have been encouraged by the exchange rate effects that the hon Gentleman mentioned.	2002-05-09.272.0	May I ask the Minister to concentrate on the impact of the exchange rate on the tourism industry, especially in the south-west?

Has she examined the study published in October 2001 by Caledonian Economics for the British Tourist Authority, and does she accept its conclusion that if we had a realistic exchange rate, the holiday industry could generate 51,000 more jobs and increase its earnings by £1.76 billion?	2002-05-09.271.6	person/10612	person/10332	True	2002-05-09	blair	False	False	0	Treasury	Treasury	Tourism (South-West)	0	liberal-democrat	False	False	labour	True	False

Then, if those tests are satisfied, we will have the triple lock of Cabinet, Parliament and the country through a referendum. That is the Government's policy, which remains unchanged.	2002-05-09.272.2	Although the Minister's comments on euro policy were typically enlightening, does she agree that they were not as enlightening as those made earlier this week by a senior Minister at the Department of Trade and Industry, who is sitting not far away from her, and who said that within two years we would have joined the eurozone?	2002-05-09.272.1	person/11036	person/10332	False	2002-05-09	blair	False	False	0	Treasury	Treasury	Tourism (South-West)	0	liberal-democrat	False	False	labour	True	False
2002-05-09.8.0	My hon Friend is right about the benefits to Scotland of good management of the United Kingdom economy as a whole. The stability that we have put in place, the 1.5 million extra jobs and the expansion in public investment that we can fund demonstrate how Scotland benefits both from being part of the United Kingdom and from devolution and the ability to control matters in the areas that are devolved to the Scottish Parliament and Executive. My hon Friend is right that those who argue for independence would bring about an economic calamity for the people of Scotland.	2002-05-09.273.0	The £8 billion increase in public expenditure that that amounts to is welcomed by my constituents and will, I am sure, be welcomed throughout Scotland. Does my right hon Friend agree that Scotland can benefit from those increases only if the UK economy as a whole is soundly managed? Can he tell me what he considers would be the effects on future public expenditure trends in Scotland if it were to go along the road of fiscal autonomy, which is the latest wheeze being dreamed up by certain people among the nationalists and others?	2002-05-09.272.6	person/11038	person/10545	True	2002-05-09	blair	False	False	0	Treasury	Treasury	Public Service Investment (Scotland)	0	labourco-operative	False	False	labour	True	False

People will ask, ""How much will we have to pay for private insurance, operations or a visit to the doctor under the Tories?"" They will never trust the Tories with the NHS again."	2002-05-09.274.0	Given that health spending in Scotland over the past five years has risen by 28 per cent. in real terms, but that in precisely the same period the average waiting time in Scotland for an out-patient appointment has risen by 25 per cent., why cannot the right hon Gentleman accept that simply spending more public money without fundamental reform of service delivery will not achieve the improvements that we all want?	2002-05-09.273.1	person/10040	person/10545	False	2002-05-09	blair	False	False	0	Treasury	Treasury	Public Service Investment (Scotland)	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False

Does my right hon Friend agree that the future of the ABB York workshop depends not only on that order, but on the new leasing market for trains and an increase in orders from overseas railway operators? Would not it help ABB's export drive if British Rail were to place the order now and demonstrate its confidence in the excellent ABB work force?	1993-06-28a.640.0	The Government are providing record levels of financial support from the public purse. In 1992–93, British Rail investment stood at the highest level for more than 30 years. Investment of more than £3 billion is planned over the next three years, £2 billion of which will be on the existing railway. Later in the summer, British Rail will place the order for the £150 million leasing facility for new rolling stock, which we proposed in advance of privatisation. We have also recently announced measures to encourage the development of a rolling stock leasing market.	1993-06-28a.639.8	person/10386	person/10242	False	1993-06-28	major	False	False	1	Transport	Transport	Railway Rolling Stock	1	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1993-06-28.1.0	First, I thank the hon Gentleman for his welcome. It is a pleasure to do business with him again. It takes us back to the golden days of the Local Government Finance Bill, when we enjoyed so many happy hours. The hon Gentleman would expect me to have done my homework on this matter. He has been a strong advocate on behalf of people on the Darrington and Limetrees estate in that corner of Pontefract. There has already been substantial investigation into the matter and the air pollution study is yet another investigation. We expect to publish draft orders in the next 12 to 18 months, which will give another opportunity to look at the matter. The preferred route, which has been announced, provides the best value for money, the least environmental impact, the greatest traffic relief to residents of Ferrybridge and Brotherton, and is supported by the majority of residents there.	1993-06-28a.642.0	"May I welcome the Minister to his new post and hope that with a new Minister we shall get some

fresh ideas on highway development in the Ferrybridge area? The study to which the Minister refers is very important because there is a plan for a 16-lane motorway to go through a conurbation 250 yd from a large junior and infant school, with a large mixed estate of council and private houses to the east, and a large housing estate to the west, less than 200 yd from the motorway. Does the Minister accept that an in-depth study is needed, and will he agree that that study will be made available for public consultation? If the proposals put forward by the Department of Transport are allowed to go ahead, we shall have the most polluted mile of motorway in the United Kingdom. Will the Minister assure me that the consultation document will be made public?"	1993-06-28a.641.7	<UNKNOWN>	person/10336	True	1993-06-28	major	False	False	0	Transport	Transport	Air Pollution (Ferrybridge)	0				<UNKNOWN>	False	False

I remind him of the tighter emission limits for new heavy duty diesels from 1 October 1993. Neither should we forget noise pollution which, from new motor vehicles, has been reduced by up to 10 decibels through tighter standards between 1980 and 1990. That is just for starters.	1993-06-28a.642.2	Does my hon Friend agree that, on the general point of controlling and reducing air pollution, the Government's commitment to catalytic converters, the greater use of unleaded petrol, and new proposals to get more freight off the roads and on to the railways is absolutely clear?	1993-06-28a.642.1	person/10190	person/10336	False	1993-06-28	major	False	False	0	Transport	Transport	Air Pollution (Ferrybridge)	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1993-06-28.2.0	I am grateful for my hon Friend's remarks about the sterling work that my right hon Friend the Secretary of State has undertaken, and I am sure that the Economic Secretary will have noted his remarks about capital allowances and rollover relief. When one considers the economic framework within which British shipping has to compete, it is worth noting that corporation tax rates in Britain are the lowest of all the G7 countries and that low interest and inflation rates contribute towards creating a climate in which British shipping can compete.	1993-06-28a.643.0	"Does my hon Friend accept that many of us involved in the British shipping industry welcome the recent initiatives taken by him and his colleagues? At the


same time, does he accept that the British merchant fleet is still at a significant fiscal disadvantage compared with many of its competitors?

1993-06-28.2.1	The hon Lady will want to congratulate my right hon Friend the Secretary of State for Transport because it was during his presidency of the Transport Council that resolutions were put forward allowing the Council to reach agreements on a common policy on safe shipping at the Luxembourg meeting on 7 June. That is a major step forward because sub-standard shipping is an urgent problem in terms of the safety of human life and the environment. That is where important results will occur, not least in narrowing the gap between the cost currently borne by the British shipping industry in enforcing high standards and the lower costs currently borne by countries that enforce regulations less rigorously. The hon Lady may like to pay a little more attention to that.	1993-06-28a.643.2	Does the Minister realise that the British merchant fleet is now as low as 291? For all the commercial reasons to which he has referred, is there not also a strong defence reason for keeping a merchant fleet?

That would not benefit our economy or any other economy. The answer must be to eliminate the state aids in other countries which currently distort the market.	1993-06-28a.643.4	I am grateful to my hon Friend for spelling out the successful actions that the Government have taken to ensure safety in the merchant fleet. Does he agree that, however right it may be in principle, the policy of trying to achieve a level playing field with our European competitors has not yet delivered that for our merchant fleet? That is why Conservative Members also support fiscal measures to give the British merchant fleet a competitive position.	1993-06-28a.643.3	person/19551	person/16406	False	1993-06-28	major	False	False	0	Transport	Transport	Merchant Fleet	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1993-06-28.3.0	The hon Gentleman well knows that we are not intending to franchise the east coast main line on the basis of only the service between London and Edinburgh. I have made it abundantly clear that all British Rail's services to Inverness and Aberdeen will be franchised. Frankly, the hon Gentleman would do a great deal more for the cause of electrification of the east coast main line to Aberdeen if he started supporting the economy of Scotland and stopped supporting the job wreckers at Timex in Dundee.	1993-06-28a.644.2	Is the Minister aware that a spokesman for Richard Branson recently announced that Virgin is investigating the cost of purchasing the east coast main line service between London and Edinburgh? Does he agree that that confirms, first, the private sector's complete lack of interest in the other part of that service—the through diesel service between London and Aberdeen—and, secondly, that companies such as Virgin are interested only in running fast trains, with few stops, for the cream of the customer load? Does the right hon Gentleman understand that if he persists with the market testing of railway services, the only and inevitable result will be fewer trains, worse services and the break-up of the national railway network?	1993-06-28a.644.1	person/10375	person/17459	True	1993-06-28	major	False	False	0	Transport	Transport	East Coast Main Line	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

The lines to which he referred are vital to the economy of that area, given that Aberdeen is the oil capital of Scotland and Inverness is the tourist and whisky capital and the fact that there are also fish and food processing exports?

1993-06-28.4.0	As my hon Friend knows, I am canvassing those issues in relation to the Green Paper on better motorways and the possibility of charging a toll. My hon Friend is right in the sense that no decision has been taken, but one of the issues put forward is whether we can accelerate the improvement in motorways. That is not least because, in this country as in others, we run the risk of greater congestion with an increase in traffic. Therefore, we wish to accelerate the improvement by widening motorways and improving the services on them through additional finance raised by a modest charge. My hon Friend is right to say that the charge needs to be modest to avoid diversion on to local roads. One of the arguments for that is the fact that about half of all motorists hardly ever or never use the motorways.	1993-06-28a.645.4	That interesting statistic illustrates why it is important that the 50 per cent. of drivers who use the motorways regularly should be asked to contribute more so that those roads can be improved. Our experience of the success of the Dartford crossing, where private venture capital was used, shows that private finance in motorway construction can play a great role in ensuring that we get the roads that people want and that traffic moves properly and does not go on to the side roads.	1993-06-28a.645.3	person/10587	person/10386	True	1993-06-28	major	False	False	0	Transport	Transport	Motorways	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1993-06-28.4.1	The hon Gentleman is entirely wrong to describe the policy as stupid. Presumably he means that he wants to restrict people's use of cars and heavy goods vehicles by fiat from Whitehall. That does not make any sense. Otherwise, what does a centralised transport policy mean? The hon Gentleman is also wrong about the balance of Government expenditure. Although 90 per cent. of all inland passenger and freight traffic goes by road, we are spending about 56 per cent. of Government expenditure on roads and 44 per cent. on public transport—including rail—this year. That is a clear indication that Government expenditure is, if anything, skewed heavily towards public transport and rail.	1993-06-28a.645.6	Will the Secretary of State confirm that his absurd policy of cutting the investment level for both British Rail and underground services by nearly£1 billion, and the reinvestment of that money on the M25, will result in that road being widened to 14 or even 20 lanes to cope with the extra cars created by that stupid transport policy?	1993-06-28a.645.5	person/10488	person/10386	False	1993-06-28	major	False	False	0	Transport	Transport	Motorways	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

I shall use my best endeavours to keep up the momentum and I look forward to discussing the matter further with him when we meet on 12 July.	1993-06-28a.646.2	As there has been some slippage in the Selby bypass project, will my hon Friend confirm that that project is now irreversible and will not be subject to either cancellation or postponement due to any internal departmental budgetary reassessment?	1993-06-28a.646.1	person/16454	person/10336	True	1993-06-28	major	False	False	0	Transport	Transport	Selby Bypass	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1993-06-28.6.0	The hon Gentleman will know that British Rail is to start design work for improving the signalling on the west coast main line this year, and will commence the work next year. I agree with both the hon Gentleman and Mr. Ivor Warburton about private sector investment. A satisfactory formula for private sector investment—particularly in signalling, which does not count as public expenditure—would be welcome. I hope that by early autumn we shall have resolved a correct formula for the introduction of private sector capital. British Rail and Railtrack will then be able to place a contract for investment in the line. That will advance the date on which we can say truthfully that the west coast main line is the premier route in the country.	1993-06-28a.646.7	"The managing director of the west coast main line, Mr. Ivor Warburton, has told the west coast main line all-party group that without substantial investment during the next 18 months there will be a ""catastrophic failure"" of track and/or signalling on that route. In the light of the Minister's letter of 23 June to the chairman of the all-party group, how does he propose to maintain the rail links to and from Europe for the industrial heartlands of the west midlands, the north-west and as far as Glasgow if the private sector fails to provide the necessary capital investment to effect the improvements?"	1993-06-28a.646.6	person/10339	person/17459	True	1993-06-28	major	False	False	0	Transport	Transport	West Coast Main Line	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1993-06-28.6.1	Clearly, some of the rolling stock on the west coast main line—in particular, that which is now 30 years old—is badly in need of replacement. That is why, as my right hon Friend the Secretary of State has said, British Rail is considering placing an order. Whatever the results of that exercise, my hon Friend knows that I am committed to work with British Rail for further orders so long as they comply fully with the Treasury guidelines on what is an operating lease. The Treasury gave the criteria for such operating leases in the latter half of last month. I hope, therefore, that it will be a question not of Networkers or 225s but of both.	1993-06-28a.647.0	"Will my right hon Friend confirm to the House that in bygone years the Great Western railway was the very best in the country?

1993-06-28.6.2	My right hon Friend the Secretary of State for Transport made it plain on Report— [Interruption.] He did. My right hon Friend made it plain that the franchising director would require all franchises in Great Britain to include discount railcards for the disabled, young people and elderly people. Therefore, the hon Gentleman should be in no doubt that the great advantage of those discounts—which we firmly believe that the market will provide—will be retained. We decided to require the franchising director to write that requirement into each franchise.	1993-06-28a.647.2	"Given that we know that west coast main line passengers must expect franchised services at some stage, will the Government take this opportunity to clarify the welcome but rather ambiguous undertaking given during the Report stage of the Railways Bill that franchise agreements will require participation in discount schemes for senior citizens, the disabled and young people""? Is that not in marked contrast to the specific commitment that railcards for disabled people would be on broadly similar lines to present arrangements""?—[Official Report, 25, May 1993; Vol. 225, 762–63.] Given the worries that have been expressed since then by British Rail and other groups, will the Minister clear the matter up for us?

1993-06-28.6.3	I can certainly confirm that routes—for example, possibly the west coast main line—will qualify for support by the franchising director if they require subsidy. At present, InterCity has a commercial remit. Profitable routes such as the east coast main line cross-subsidise others such as the west coast main line. The Conservative party believes that where public money is to be used, we should all know precisely where that money goes. We have given every assurance that whether the service is InterCity, Regional Railways or Network SouthEast, it will continue to receive support if it is socially desirable.	1993-06-28a.647.4	I thank my right hon Friend for the excellent letter of 23 June to which the hon Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Kilfoyle) alluded.

He is already planning with his staff for the commencement, subject to Parliament's approval, of Railtrack on 1 April next year. As to British Rail's organisation, the hon Gentleman should realise that British Rail already runs its passenger operations on the basis of 26 profit centres; there are another nine freight profit centres, and so on. That is how modern industry is organised. As I travel the country—sometimes ahead of the hon Gentleman, sometimes behind him—visiting profit centres, I find that morale among senior British Rail managers is excellent now. They are getting on with the job of preparing the rail industry for its reorganisation and improvement.	1993-06-28a.648.1	Would not the people who use the west coast main line and, indeed, those who use other main lines in need of investment be better served if the Government instructed or allowed British Rail to invest in the future of those lines instead of constantly spending money on restructuring? Will the Minister confirm that, by next April, having recently undergone a major reorganisation, British Rail will have to divide itself into no fewer than 65 companies comprising 26 train companies, 10 rail track companies, 16 infrastructure companies, three train leasing companies and 10 commercial service groups in order to meet the Government's privatisation plans? How much will all that cost? Will the right hon Gentleman express that figure as a percentage of the£170 million that British Rail has apparently lost in the last year? Will the Minister bear in mind that whereas workers at Timex face a£60 a week loss, he has just given Railtrack's three-day-a-week chairman a£100,000 increase?	1993-06-28a.648.0	person/10644	person/17459	False	1993-06-28	major	False	False	0	Transport	Transport	West Coast Main Line	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

It is part of the policy that we should enable civil servants to show, as they often can, that they can do the jobs very well, both by management buy-outs, which sometimes they have achieved, or by straight in-house bids, and sometimes by transferring successfully—as, for example, at Devonport dockyard—to private sector contractors and working very well with those private sector employers.	1993-06-28a.650.9	Could my right hon Friend extend market testing to ensure that when civil service jobs are about to be moved from one constituency to another area, the civil servants who are doing those jobs are given the opportunity to bid for them under private management?	1993-06-28a.650.8	person/10073	person/19427	False	1993-06-28	major	False	False	0	Cabinet Office	Duchy Of Lancaster	Market Testing	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1993-06-28.9.3	I think that the hon Lady has got her brief back to front. The wages issue is normally raised by local authorities. Labour local authorities have got used to compulsory competitive tendering. can give the hon Lady one example. It happens to be the latest. RAF Finningly has stated that it expects to achieve savings of£3·5 million in the first year, 1993, and£29 million over 10 years through efficiency savings, including market testing of the technical maintenance of aircraft. That represents between 20 and 25 per cent., which is exactly the point that the hon Lady does not understand. She will find that it has nothing to do with pay. It is the result of greater efficiency in the organisation of the function.	1993-06-28a.651.1	The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster has announced that he believes that there is a cost saving of about 25 per cent. in the civil service as a result of market testing. Can he confirm that there is no evidence to suggest that that 25 per cent. cost saving is the result of internal efficiency—as would be the case with many Labour local authorities, if they were allowed to make the decision at local level, as opposed to being dictated to by central Government at Westminster—but that it is solely as a result of cutting wages and changing the terms and conditions of civil servants? That is the result of the right hon Gentleman's market testing. There has been no increase in the quality of service.	1993-06-28a.651.0	person/10449	person/19427	False	1993-06-28	major	False	False	0	Cabinet Office	Duchy Of Lancaster	Market Testing	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1993-06-28.10.0	I agree entirely about the need to reduce the regulatory burden, especially on small companies. The citizens charter and deregulation go hand in hand; they are not alternatives. They are both about providing a better quality of service to users and improving efficiency. I agree with my hon Friend that we must ensure that unnecessary regulation is avoided and that new regulations are not excessively onerous for the business community. In that context, it is no coincidence that the policy to deregulate London Buses was mentioned in the citizens charter White Paper.	1993-06-28a.651.6	I thank my hon Friend for his reply. Is he, perhaps like me, concerned that our business community will soon need its own charter to protect it from the growth in the inspectorates that are now visiting it almost daily: environmental health inspectors, agricultural inspectors, safety at work inspectors and weights and measures inspectors—you name it, there is an inspector for it? Does he agree that it is very important that we as a Government, and he as a Minister, keep an eye on the growth of that sector of the civil service, because otherwise we shall kill the goose that lays the golden egg?	1993-06-28a.651.5	person/10236	person/10162	True	1993-06-28	major	False	False	0	Cabinet Office	Duchy Of Lancaster	Citizens Charter	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1993-06-28.10.1	That is an extraordinary statement. The hon Gentleman should have read the ombudsman's report on the disability living allowance, in which he identified the charter as a very important tool in achieving better terms, improvements and recompense for people who had suffered under the scheme.	1993-06-28a.652.0	"Instead of wasting civil servants' time on these useless public relations exercises that are called charters, why does not the Minister do something sensible

for a change and transfer civil servants to the disability living allowance unit at Blackpool, where applications for mobility allowance and attendance allowance are still weeks behind? People are living in great difficulty because of the delays, which result from the Government not providing enough civil servants for the job."	1993-06-28a.651.7	person/16389	person/10162	False	1993-06-28	major	False	False	0	Cabinet Office	Duchy Of Lancaster	Citizens Charter	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

As part of its work, it will be seeking the views of public service and other organisations and, of course, those of members of the public.	1993-06-28a.652.6	To ask the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster how much has been expended on citizens charters since their inception.	1993-06-28a.652.1	person/10025	person/10162	False	1993-06-28	major	False	False	0	Cabinet Office	Duchy Of Lancaster	Citizens Charter	3	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1993-06-28.10.3	"I am happy to give my hon Friend just such an assurance. He is right to state that complaints systems must be easy to use and that complaints must be responded to by the people who operate those systems. I cite an example: just such an attitude is engendered in the Department of Social Security's OTIS system. It stands for


""opportunity to improve service"", and the evidence so far is that improving services is exactly what it has done, precisely because it is simple and quick and enables the service to analyse complaints and to respond to them effectively and speedily."	1993-06-28a.652.8	I am grateful to my hon Friend. Is he aware that many people still find it a bureaucratic nightmare to make a complaint to and about a public sector organisation? Can he assure me that the complaints task force will draw up a set of principles to make it easier to make a complaint and to encourage public service organisations to treat complaints more positively and as a means of ensuring their own effectiveness?	1993-06-28a.652.7	person/22351	person/10162	False	1993-06-28	major	False	False	0	Cabinet Office	Duchy Of Lancaster	Citizens Charter	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1993-06-28.10.4	Naturally, I should be happy to consider the matter if the hon Gentleman would write to me or give me some notice, rather than bouncing it and trying to score political points. If he cares to write to me, I shall deal with the matter.	1993-06-28a.653.1	May I refer the Minister to a complaint that I received About the Cheshire family health services authority, which gave some of my constituents five days' notice that their doctor's surgery was about to close? I checked the citizens charter, which states that patients have a right to be-consulted about their services, but when I checked with the family health services authority, I found that there was no law to ensure that they were. The Cheshire family health services authority closed the surgery regardless of the views of my constituents. Will the Minister take on board my ten-minute Bill, which would amend the law to ensure that in future patients are consulted about doctors' surgeries and the services that they receive?	1993-06-28a.653.0	person/10253	person/10162	False	1993-06-28	major	False	False	0	Cabinet Office	Duchy Of Lancaster	Citizens Charter	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1993-06-28.11.0	The hon Gentleman makes a very fair point. It is perfectly easy to describe the process, but what really matters is to get it established well and working well. My Department is now involved in a series of regional visits across the country, discussing how best to take forward the programme—officials have doubtless been to Leeds to discuss it with the relevant players there. It is essential that we have the involvement of those working at the laboratory bench and those in industry who really understand markets.	1993-06-28a.654.1	I think that the Minister would agree that the Technology Foresight programme looks constructive on paper, but that, as in science itself, translation from theory into practice is not always easy and requires resources and imagination. In view of the transfer of responsibility from the Department of Trade and Industry to the Office of Science and Technology, can the right hon Gentleman assure me that funds have followed the transfer and that he has the necessary funds to launch and promote the programme? What measures has he taken to encourage to join his steering committee people with the creativity, imagination and commitment to ensure that the programme translates from theory into practice?	1993-06-28a.654.0	person/10250	person/19427	True	1993-06-28	major	False	False	0	Cabinet Office	Duchy Of Lancaster	Technology Transfer	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1993-06-28.11.1	My hon Friend makes an essential point. The Technology Foresight programme here must be like the successful programmes abroad and not be dominated by Whitehall; it must be led by practitioners in the field including scientists, engineers and industrialists. We at the centre should simply be the secretariat for the process. That is the intention.	1993-06-28a.654.3	Does my right hon Friend agree that the more industry is involved in the Technology Foresight programme, the more likely it is that industry will pick up the fruits of that programme and carry them through to the marketplace?	1993-06-28a.654.2	person/16577	person/19427	False	1993-06-28	major	False	False	0	Cabinet Office	Duchy Of Lancaster	Technology Transfer	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1993-06-28.12.0	I agree entirely with my hon Friend. The proposal to produce league tables will be one of the motivating forces for improving our education service. That is true whether it relates to educational achievement in its academic sense or to truancy. In respect of the latter point, I note that a report was published today which is very helpful. With regard to my hon Friend's point about value added tables, of course we believe that they would be the best kind of tables to have. However, as my hon Friend will understand, it will take time to develop a database for those tables to work. In the meantime, we see absolutely no reason to deny parents the kind of information that would allow them to take the proper action in the best interests of their children's education.	1993-06-28a.655.0	I particularly welcome the further and higher education charters. May I ask for more action on schools charters and particularly the publication of league tables for school attendance, allowing for a proper value added section? Is not it legitimate and right that parents should know which schools achieve high attendance? Is not the charter a good way of achieving that? In my right hon Friend's opinion, why does the Labour party oppose providing information about schools? The Labour party does not care about parents' right to know.	1993-06-28a.654.7	person/22587	person/10162	True	1993-06-28	major	False	False	0	Cabinet Office	Duchy Of Lancaster	Citizens Charters	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1993-06-28.12.1	Absolutely not. Housing benefit and income support are designed for people who need them because they are in poverty or in poor circumstances of one kind or another. They are not designed as a giveaway for students in our society. I believe that it is a very bad idea to start young people off on a dependent mode as they begin their careers.	1993-06-28a.655.2	Will the further and higher education charters include the right for students to claim housing benefit and income support during summer recesses? Some of my constituents will have less than£5 a week to live on this summer after they have paid their rent during the college recess. That is an unacceptable imposition of poverty on our youth and on the development of their educational potential in respect of industry. If the further and higher education charters are to mean something, there must be a right of access to housing benefit and income support for students when they are not at college.	1993-06-28a.655.1	person/10379	person/10162	False	1993-06-28	major	False	False	0	Cabinet Office	Duchy Of Lancaster	Citizens Charters	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1993-06-28.13.0	I note that the Welsh Conservative party lead on that matter as, doubtless, it leads on others. I also note that there is no proper spokesman for science and engineering in the shadow Cabinet and that is a matter of regret. I also note that in Wales there are major developments in this area. For example, the Agricultural and Food Research Council is now concentrating most of its work on grassland research in Wales and that is quite proper.	1993-06-28a.655.7	I thank my right hon Friend for corning to Wales to make the first speech on science and engineering at a party conference for many years. Does not that reflect the importance that the Government attach to science and engineering—unlike the Labour party, which attaches very little importance to that subject?	1993-06-28a.655.6	person/20571	person/19427	True	1993-06-28	major	False	False	0	Cabinet Office	Duchy Of Lancaster	Science And Engineering (Wales)	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1993-06-28.14.0	I thank my hon Friend for his comments.

Within more explicit guidelines … research is to have regard to its relevance and potential for appropriation by industry and other users. These are changes to be greatly welcomed. I agree with him entirely.	1993-06-28a.656.4	Is my hon Friend aware that trade and industry are delighted with the emphasis that the Government are now placing on the research councils' drive for wealth creation? That is just what industry and commerce want, and it is just what the doctor ordered.	1993-06-28a.656.3	person/16395	person/10162	True	1993-06-28	major	False	False	0	Cabinet Office	Duchy Of Lancaster	Investors And Risk Takers	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1993-06-28.15.0	My hon Friend is right. There has been a very broad welcome for the White Paper. As sometimes happens, the spokesman for the Labour party in the House of Lords, who had perhaps read the document before responding to it, got it right in welcoming it, whereas its spokesman in this House had not read it and did not welcome it.	1993-06-28a.656.9	Is my right hon Friend aware that Sir Ralph Robins letter was also signed by the chief executives of Glaxo, British Aerospace and many others? Does not that show that the vast majority of British industrialists fully support my right hon Friend's White Paper on science, engineering and technology?	1993-06-28a.656.8	person/18022	person/19427	True	1993-06-28	major	False	False	0	Cabinet Office	Duchy Of Lancaster	Rolls-Royce	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

Counter-Inflation Policy
3. Mr. Robert B. Jones asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make a statement about counter-inflation policy.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Nigel Lawson): Since 1980 inflation has fallen from 20 per cent. to 5 per cent.—the lowest level since the 1960s. In my Budget statement I reaffirmed the Government's commitment to continue the drive against inflation through sound monetary policies."	1985-03-21a.967.18	Does that mean that the Chief Secretary does not realise that the village halls which are maintained by voluntary local effort, rather than those which are provided by local councils and are VAT exempt, are bearing this burden? As many were built before the war or soon after it and will need building alterations, would it not have been a better Budget if the Chancellor of the Exchequer had announced that he would stop raiding jumble sale proceeds and let village halls use their money to maintain their buildings by voluntary effort?	1985-03-21a.967.17	person/10034	person/18892	True	1985-03-21	thatcher	False	False	0	National Finance	National Finance	Value Added Tax	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

With regard to the weakness of the dollar to which he has referred, it might be a little early to pass judgment on that phenomenon.	1985-03-21a.969.8	Does my hon Friend agree that a period of sustained dollar weakness might cause just as many problems as the recent dollar strength?

The impact of inflation on their pockets has been greater than taxation.	1985-03-21a.970.3	It it not misleading and useless to talk about increased tax burdens without considering the relationship of a person in work and his standard of living compared with the rate of inflation?

will possibly be a small increase in the savings ratio during the coming year but it is unlikely to have any very substantial effect. As for the relationship between the savings ratio in this country and that in the United States, whatever the hon Gentleman may say, the ratio of savings in the United States is very much lower than it is in this country. In fact, in this country the savings ratio has been above these levels only when inflation has been very high. I am glad to say that inflation has now come down."	1985-03-21a.970.10	Will the Economic Secretary be good enough to answer the second part of my question: does he expect a higher ratio in 1985–86? If he does not, why is the Treasury so supine in the light of a declining savings ratio? Is he not aware that in the United States the public tend to save more when inflation is low?

It is some kind of cheek for the Opposition to refer to gas and electricity prices, when during their last period in office gas and electricity prices increased by 2 per cent. every six weeks.	1985-03-21a.971.6	Is not unemployment likely to be higher this time next year than it is now? If so, does it not show how irrelevant is the Budget to the the situation that faces the country?

Some people are already criticising, but that makes a total of about £1·2 billion.	1985-03-21a.972.4	The Financial Secretary seems to expect a big reduction in unemployment as a result of the changes in national insurance contributions, but will he take into account the fact that they will cost only £450 million in a full year, whereas the reduction in the national insurance surcharge cost £900 million last year, and even more the year before?

1985-03-21.9.1	I have no doubt that my hon Friend is correct to point out that the higher budget deficit which is involved in higher public expenditure places a strain on interest rates and therefore causes damage to the private sector.	1985-03-21a.976.7	Does my hon Friend agree that the best way to keep interest rates low is to reduce the competition for scarce funds from the public sector and allow the private sector to create jobs by spending more money?	1985-03-21a.976.6	person/18674	person/13386	False	1985-03-21	thatcher	False	False	0	National Finance	National Finance	Interest Rates	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

If interest rates turn out to be lower than we have projected, we shall all be very glad about the public expenditure consequences of that. But, since it is the prime purpose of our monetary policy to maintain monetary conditions to bring down inflation, we have to accept that that has a cost in interest rates as well.	1985-03-21a.977.6	In view of the public uncertainty and concern about the Government's policies on interest rates, will the Economic Secretary elucidate the bald but very pregnant sentence in his right hon Friend's Budget speech in which he said, without explanation, that he was increasing the provision in public expenditure figures for future years for debt interest?	1985-03-21a.977.5	person/19420	person/13386	False	1985-03-21	thatcher	False	False	0	National Finance	National Finance	Interest Rates	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1985-03-21.10.0	Yes, indeed. It has been a constant objective of the Government, both under my predecessor as Chancellor and myself, to reduce the effect of these traps, and particularly the employment trap. Thresholds have now risen by more than 20 per cent. in real terms over what they were under Labour. My hon Friend is right to direct attention to the restructuring of the national insurance contributions system, the first time that such restructuring has ever been done, and I believe that it will have a very helpful effect indeed where unemployment is at its most severe.	1985-03-21a.978.0	"That is an encouraging figure.

It is extraordinary for the Opposition to maintain that the proposals in the Budget concerning national insurance were derived from the Labour party manifesto. Following what the Leader of the Opposition said about that, I looked into the matter and found that all that they said in their manifesto was that the upper earnings limit for employees should be abolished. That was the one thing that I conspicuously refrained from doing.	1985-03-21a.978.4	Has my right hon Friend noticed that 260,000 of those who will no longer be paying tax as a result of the Budget are over working age?

The Chancellor said that the cost of his YTS plans would be £125 million in 1986–87 and would in part be offset by savings in social security payments. How will those savings be made?

The hon Lady might also be aware of the fact that, in the past 10 years, the real rate of duty on spirits has fallen by some 16 per cent. in real terms. I think that she is giving a slightly distorted story. In the industry in general, since 1980, exports have gone up from £746 million in 1980 to over £2 billion in 1994. I believe that the industry is attacking its markets very aggressively and successfully.	1995-05-24a.885.5	Will the Minister confirm that the figures that he has just given are taken from the Scottish register of employment, which takes no account of establishments that employ 11 or fewer employees? In that context, does he accept that the rise in the excise duty on Scotch whisky since the Government came to power has been about 30 per cent. and that the decline in the home market has sent out the wrong message to foreign markets? Does he therefore agree that we have to take tender steps to ensure that the Scotch whisky industry is protected and that there will be no further mothballing as there has been at Tamnavulin, Tullibardine and Bruichladdich?	1995-05-24a.885.4	person/10191	person/22653	True	1995-05-24	major	False	False	0	Scotland	Scotland	Whisky Industry	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

He referred to taxation and to what the Chancellor had to do in his second run at the Budget. What he had to do was something that the Labour party is totally incapable of doing—balance the Budget. The Labour party has proposals for a tax-raising Scottish Parliament, which would mean that it would have to address the problem of balancing the Budget. If it could say clearly to Scottish business and to the Scottish people that they would definitely not face a taxation increase, the hon Gentleman might address taxation issues in a more responsible manner.	1995-05-24a.886.1	Is the Minister aware that Saturday the 27th of this month marks the quincentennial celebration of the discovery or the invention of Scotch whisky? To assist the Scotch whisky industry with all its magnificent efforts in exports, the Government should remind the Chancellor that he put the 25p après-Budget additional tax on whisky in a fit of pique because the House democratically voted not to allow him to put the second tranche of VAT on fuel.	1995-05-24a.886.0	person/18408	person/22653	False	1995-05-24	major	False	False	0	Scotland	Scotland	Whisky Industry	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

The nuclear industry, like the rest of the electricity industry, has, of course, been rationalising itself to get costs down, to be competitive and to be efficient. The benefit of that to the Scottish economy is considerable. Scottish Hydro-Electric has been increasing jobs, with a net increase of 94 jobs, which is so important in the Perthshire economy. For the rest of the industry,


there has been a 120,000 net increase in employment over the past 10 years. That is the product of a more efficient economy, to which lower energy prices contribute."	1995-05-24a.886.6	What the Secretary of State has not told us is that many hundreds of jobs have been lost as a result of the privatisation of the electricity and gas industries. If the Secretary of State had given those figures, they would have proven sufficient reason for those currently employed at Scottish Nuclear to fear its privatisation. Will the Secretary of State give one simple guarantee to the work force based at the headquarters of Scottish Nuclear in East Kilbride?

Naturally, I expect the new council to have adequate funds to fulfil its responsibilities—bearing in mind the Government's position at the time in relation to the block grant. The hon Lady mentioned the detrunking of a certain road in her constituency, particularly between Campbeltown and Ballachuilish. The main road from Lochgilphead is trunked to the national network, as are the roads to Oban and Fort William.

The actual average increase in rents in Scotland is 28.78p per week, which is certainly well below the English figure, which is almost £10 more per week. The real reason is that, if the relevant housing association wishes to spend sufficient funds on management and maintenance, it will put up rents accordingly. It is for the Scottish Homes board to decide what the level of rents should be for Scottish Homes stock. No direction is given by Ministers.	1995-05-24a.889.5	How can the Minister possibly justify rent increases in the public sector of almost 5 per cent. in my constituency when the Government are trying to hold down wage claims and offering nurses in my constituency an increase of 2.5 per cent.?

Does he realise that not only the sleeper services but the overnight seating service to Scotland are being affected?

That should lead to a service that is not only cheaper, but better.	1995-05-24a.891.1	In Perth and Kinross, the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State have been banging on about the integrity of the Union. Does the Secretary of State accept that the logic of that statement means that there should be adequate rail access to all parts of the UK, including the highlands?

The great advantage of local negotiations is that local pay can be an important step towards making services more responsive to local needs. Local pay does not necessarily mean less pay; it means fair pay, taking local circumstances properly into account.	1995-05-24a.891.6	Will the Minister admit that his written answer to me yesterday shows that the Government's claim that nurses across Scotland would be offered 3 per cent. is entirely bogus? The truth is total chaos and disarray, with only eight of 47 trusts offering 3 per cent. without strings, and all the others seeking to reduce nurses' conditions of service by removing statutory holidays or making other changes?

That is precisely what we are talking about, together with improved services. The great advantage of introducing private sector finance is to make public sector funds go much further while providing improved services. On Stonehaven, Grampian health board is consulting on the way forward. It intends to take the lead and to tender for the service. It is likely to involve local trusts and general practitioners, but there is the possibility of opening up the tender to private providers. That has not been ruled out. The decision as to who wins will depend upon the level of services and the provision of a better service for patients."	1995-05-24a.892.2	"When the Minister last met the chairmen of the health trusts, did he express any shame about the fact that his Department is now pushing the NHS towards privatisation in Scotland? Is not the evidence for that seen in what is happening in Stonehaven today, where Grampian health board is being obliged by the Scottish Office to offer any or all hospital services or even the entire new hospital to the private profit-making sector? When the Prime Minister told the Tory party conference in 1991 that there would be no … privatisation of health care, neither piecemeal, nor in part, nor as a whole"", people listened to him. Now, they will concentrate on what is happening in Stonehaven. Has not the contrast between those words and the reality of privatisation in the health service led the Conservative party in Scotland into electoral freefall?"	1995-05-24a.892.1	person/10504	person/17208	False	1995-05-24	major	False	False	0	Scotland	Scotland	Hospital Wages And Service Provisions	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1995-05-24.7.0	The hon Gentleman might be interested to know that between Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise, the total figure estimated for 1995–96, excluding modern apprenticeships, is 35,000. The hon Gentleman is a little out of date with his figures. I understand that, on Friday, the hon Gentleman is due to visit his local enterprise company, Forth Valley Enterprise, which started the skillseekers programme in April. If the hon Gentleman were to consult more widely, he would find that it has been widely accepted by employers around the country. Local enterprise companies have considerable flexibility in the way in which they can operate within specified guidelines. Just the other day, I introduced a new pilot scheme in Fife. It is called fast track and trainees will be able to undertake full-time education as well. On monitoring, payment will be made only after very stringent checks against the stringent standards that will have been set by the enterprise companies.	1995-05-24a.893.1	"That is a very vague answer from the Minister. I was given better figures by Scottish Enterprise, which estimates that £70 million will go into the skillseekers programme, and it is looking for 30,000 jobs with training. Does the Minister share with me the concern of everyone to whom I have spoken in the past month that the vouchers-for-training scheme is just the beginning of Tory party dogma—the thin end of the wedge—of vouchers for nurseries and vouchers for education? Young people will be out in the market grasping their vouchers and those who will be taking them on will be thinking, ""How can I get this person through this job with the least money coming from the employer?"" Every person to whom I have spoken has said that there is no increase in money for monitoring. How do the Government expect young people to obtain decent training without anybody supporting them? Why is there no more money for monitoring to ensure that the skillseekers programme is not just another youth rip-off scheme?"	1995-05-24a.893.0	person/10128	person/22653	True	1995-05-24	major	False	False	0	Scotland	Scotland	Skillseekers Training Programme	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1995-05-24.7.1	My hon Friend is absolutely correct. The Opposition are full of words, but little action. My hon Friend referred to skillseekers being piloted in Grampian. He would be interested to learn that in Grampian the number of young people with employed status has risen from 422 at the end of December 1991, under the youth training scheme, to 3,726 at the end of March 1995 under skillseekers. That speaks louder than words.	1995-05-24a.893.3	Does my hon Friend agree that skillseekers, which started in Grampian in his area, has been a marked success throughout Scotland? Is it not significant that this, together with every other training initiative introduced by the Government, has been automatically opposed by the Labour party?	1995-05-24a.893.2	person/22601	person/22653	False	1995-05-24	major	False	False	0	Scotland	Scotland	Skillseekers Training Programme	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1995-05-24.8.0	My hon Friend is absolutely right to suggest that Scottish farm incomes have risen substantially. Last year, they increased by no less than 25 per cent. to £454 million, the highest figure for 17 years. As he said, Perth and Kinross is the sort of area that benefits substantially from the money going into both less-favoured areas and non-LFA areas. The future looks good, provided people make the right decision tomorrow.	1995-05-24a.894.2	I thank my hon Friend for that reply. Does he agree that farmers and farm workers in Perthshire are enjoying increasing prosperity?

1995-05-24.9.0	The hon Gentleman's supplementary question shows that he has been misinformed. His main question related to nuclear waste generated in Scotland, and there is no problem with that. Low-level waste from Hunterston, Torness and Chapelcross is taken to Drigg. High-level waste is retained on site for 50 years. There is no problem because, whoever is the owner or manager of Scottish Nuclear's output from its generating stations, the whole process is carried out extremely safely.	1995-05-24a.894.7	The Minister failed to identify radioactive waste disposal locations in his reply. Is it not utterly irresponsible of the Government to sell the nuclear industry to finance tax bribes, while neglecting the safety of the people of Scotland? Will he give an assurance that enough is being done for the people of Scotland?	1995-05-24a.894.6	person/10337	person/18487	True	1995-05-24	major	False	False	0	Scotland	Scotland	Nuclear Waste	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

to imply that the people of Perth and Kinross have to decide clearly what they believe to be best for the future, not only for Perth and Kinross but for Scotland. There is no doubt that the proposals for a tax-raising Parliament and for an independent Scotland would severely jeopardise prospects not just for indigenous industry but for inward investment in both Scotland generally and Perth and Kinross in particular."	1995-05-24a.894.12	Does my hon Friend agree that the most important employer in Perth is General Accident? Has that company not made it clear that a tax regime resulting from a tax-raising Scottish Assembly or the higher taxes of an independent Scotland would cause it to reconsider its employment policy in Perth?	1995-05-24a.894.11	person/22674	person/22653	True	1995-05-24	major	False	False	0	Scotland	Scotland	Unemployment, Perth And Kinross	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1995-05-24.10.1	The hon Lady is in her usual negative mode. I had rather hoped that she might talk about some significant good news. For example, Monax Glass, the manufacturer of engineering and scientific glassware in Perth, announced an investment of £250,000 last month, creating 40 jobs in Perth. Indeed, Perth Fresh Meats Ltd., which I visited last week and which is part of the Beck Food group, announced that it was to create more than 110 new jobs in Perth. The hon Lady is in her usual negative mode. If she were to talk Scotland and Perth and Kinross up, she might do a little better for Scotland.	1995-05-24a.895.1	There is no one more accident prone in Perth and Kinross than the Tory candidate. Has the Minister taken the trouble to read the House of Commons research paper that tells him that in April 1990 there were 2,143 claimants in Perth and Kinross and by April 1994 the number had risen to 2,647? A whole year later there is no change for the better. Does he realise that that is an increase of 24 per cent. and that today 11 people chase every job advertised in Perth town centre? Is that not why the Tories are in meltdown in Perth and Kinross?	1995-05-24a.895.0	person/10215	person/22653	False	1995-05-24	major	False	False	0	Scotland	Scotland	Unemployment, Perth And Kinross	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1995-05-24.10.2	My hon Friend is exactly right. The policies on the minimum wage and other employment characteristics, which are supported by all Opposition parties, would be severely detrimental to Scottish business and the Scottish economy as a whole.	1995-05-24a.895.3	Does my hon Friend agree that training for jobseekers is just as important in Perth and Kinross as it is in other parts of Scotland?

few years have not demonstrated that the public sector has the capacity to deliver the quality of rail service that this country needs."	1995-05-24a.895.8	Is the Secretary of State aware that people in Scotland fear that the Government are opting out of the transport network in privatising British Rail?

1995-05-24.11.1	My hon Friend is absolutely right. One of the encouraging features of the rising prosperity in this country is the increasing use of various air routes around the United Kingdom. That is reflected in massive new investment at Glasgow and Edinburgh airports of £30 million and £100 million respectively.	1995-05-24a.896.1	When my right hon Friend next meets the TUC, will he point out the great advantages that are being brought about by air liberalisation and allowing competition to take place between British Midland and British Airways, to the benefit of all passengers in Scotland who use those routes?	1995-05-24a.896.0	person/10397	person/18050	False	1995-05-24	major	False	False	0	Scotland	Scotland	Transport Network	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1995-05-24.11.2	Surely the hon Gentleman knows by now that internal discussions between Ministers are not made public. He will wish to address his point to my right hon Friend the Secretary of State for Transport.	1995-05-24a.896.3	In discharging responsibilities with regard to the Scottish transport network, the Secretary of State will know that under section 5 of the Railways Act 1993 the Secretary of State for Transport can give directions to the franchising director, Mr. Salmon, including a direction that Mr. Salmon must submit to the Department of Transport the criteria that he will apply when he puts loss-making services into the passenger service obligation. Has the Secretary of State been involved in discussing those criteria?

If he wants to send me any further details, however, I shall see whether there is any way in which I can help him.	1995-05-24a.896.5	The Secretary of State will be aware that the rail services provided in the Strathclyde regional council area, part-funded by that council, are a key part of Scotland's transport network. But is he aware that the Argyll line services to Cambuslang, Rutherglen and Halfway have been effectively closed over the past few months because of flooding of the line? Despite the efforts of Strathclyde region to get together with ScotRail to try to come up with alternatives to that closed service, ScotRail does not seem to be moving. If the Secretary of State is really concerned about Scotland's rail network, will he ensure that ScotRail co-operates with Strathclyde regional council to re-establish that rail service?	1995-05-24a.896.4	person/10376	person/18050	False	1995-05-24	major	False	False	0	Scotland	Scotland	Transport Network	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

Will he undertake to have a discussion with the Secretary of State for Transport? He cannot tell us publicly what he has discussed, but could he not use his influence to upgrade facilities at Stranraer?	1995-05-24a.896.6	person/10553	person/18050	False	1995-05-24	major	False	False	0	Scotland	Scotland	Transport Network	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1995-05-24.11.5	We are sweeping away the remnants of the socialist ideology and dogma that led to so many public utilities being brought into the public sector, thereby denying them the resources and investment that they needed to stay efficient and modern. Now we are giving them the opportunity to break free from that constraint, just as we have done with telephones, the airlines, gas and electricity and so many other industries. Where they relied before on Government subsidies of £50 million a week, they are now profitable, successful, more efficient and generating revenue to the Exchequer of around £50 million a week, I have no doubt that railway privatisation will lead to massive improvements for the people of this country.	1995-05-24a.897.1	Would the Secretary of State give a warm welcome to the right hon Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), who is lurking suspiciously at the end of the Government Front Bench? While he is doing so, could he bring to mind the prophetic words of his late colleague, Mr. Robert Adley, who described railway privatisation as the poll tax on wheels? Does he not realise that privatising the railways in Scotland will be as wasteful, costly and electorally devastating as the poll tax was to turn out to be? Is it not time that the Secretary of State put Scotland before Tory ideology and, perhaps, put the people of Scotland and their interests before his career plans in the Cabinet?	1995-05-24a.897.0	person/10504	person/18050	False	1995-05-24	major	False	False	0	Scotland	Scotland	Transport Network	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

Clearly, however, elderly people who need long-stay NHS care will receive it. Guidance has been issued on the subject and, if an element of patients' needs cannot be readily met, quite simply they should not and will not be discharged. We are to consult shortly on Scottish provisions on the NHS role in continuing care and on

provision for appeals against a clinician's assessment for continuing NHS in-patient care, because, on occasions, some of the disputes relate to decisions made by clinicians. I shall bear in mind the hon Gentleman's points, as will my right hon and learned Friend the Minister of State."	1995-05-24a.897.6	Does the Under-Secretary realise that there is fear and dismay in Lothian because the number of long-stay beds for the elderly is to be more than halved by the end of the century, with the prospect of eight beds in 10 disappearing by 2005? Does he accept that the main result will be not more care in the community but more elderly people paying for nursing home care? Having paid once through tax and national insurance contributions, why should many elderly people have to pay yet again, some having to sell their homes to do so?	1995-05-24a.897.5	person/10102	person/17208	True	1995-05-24	major	False	False	0	Scotland	Scotland	Elderly Care Beds	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1995-05-24.12.1	Some of the matters that the hon Gentleman raises should be addressed to the Department of Social Security, but we regard it as extremely important that sufficient resources are made available. There has been enhanced mainstream funding of £158 million this year from the transfer of former DSS funds. Some £14 million has been transferred under the mental illness specific grant scheme, and £50 million has been transferred from the health boards to the local authorities. We anticipate that the transfer could be about some £200 million early in the next decade. We cannot state the exact sum at this stage because much of what happens will depend on the judgment of clinicians.	1995-05-24a.898.1	In the consultation that the hon Gentleman has just announced, will he take into account the concern that is felt by many people who occupy NHS continuing care beds, who face the prospect of being transferred into the social work care in the community package and who, in the course of so doing, have not only their needs assessed but their means tested? Will he give a categorical assurance that Scottish health boards will have enough finance to ensure that transitional protection elements are in place, so that there are no costs to existing patients in continuing care in the NHS? During the consultations, will he undertake a review to ensure that benefit thresholds are relaxed so that people's inheritances do not in future have to pay for their continuing care?	1995-05-24a.898.0	person/10345	person/17208	False	1995-05-24	major	False	False	0	Scotland	Scotland	Elderly Care Beds	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1995-05-24.12.2	My hon Friend is right. Greater Glasgow health board received a general allocation for revenue expenditure this year of £585.66 million which, together with efficiency savings, gives an increase of 3.76 per cent. over the year before. I am delighted that such progress has been made in my hon Friend's constituency.	1995-05-24a.898.3	My hon Friend will be aware that in my constituency Greater Glasgow health board has increased the number of continuing care beds compared with its original plans.

purpose of the scheme is to make public sector funds go much further by bringing in private sector funds to make it certain that high standards will be implemented."	1995-05-24a.898.5	Will the Minister try to understand that the quality of those NHS continuing care beds that do survive depends entirely on the people who staff those beds—the doctors, nurses, radiologists, ancillary workers and other NHS workers? Will he try to understand above all that those dedicated people will not be bought and sold like cattle in a marketplace? We need a guarantee from the Minister that no NHS job will be put up for sale to the private sector in open competition in Stonehaven or anywhere else in Scotland. It is simple: either he rules out or he rules in privatising the people who are the NHS in Scotland.

1995-05-24.13.0	I can reassure the hon Gentleman that that has been done. The Minister of State has asked the chief executive to review the level of cover in that area and to identify any measures that can be taken to improve the response times, particularly in circumstances of exceptional demand. The targets for Paisley and Greenock are for an ambulance to arrive within eight minutes for 50 per cent. of emergency calls and within 18 minutes for 95 per cent. of calls. In 1994–95, the Greenock station consistently met those targets, but a review is being undertaken, as the hon Gentleman has requested.	1995-05-24a.899.6	Despite the unhelpful and dimwitted remarks made by the chief executive in a letter to a colleague, I seek neither to rubbish the ambulance service nor to cause more distress to the family of a constituent who was severely injured in a recent traffic accident and had to wait 30 minutes for an ambulance. I have every respect for ambulance crews, and I do not agree that there is a problem with the local management and control of the service.

1995-05-24.15.0	I think that I know what my hon Friend is talking about. I accept that local enterprise companies in the Scottish Enterprise area have probably set a greater premium on commercial confidentiality than the Scottish tourist board before them or local enterprise companies in the highlands and islands. He might be interested to know that, while the Scottish Affairs Select Committee has made some recommendations in its report, which Ministers are considering, local enterprise companies in the Scottish Enterprise area are now advising applicants that certain details of financial assistance to individual projects may be made public in the future. I hope that that is a helpful answer to my hon Friend.	1995-05-24a.900.8	I thank my hon Friend for that very unhelpful reply. Is he aware that one of the most important things that this House does is to vote Supply, and that the cornerstone of our unwritten constitution is a Member's right to ask questions and have them answered? It may therefore come as a surprise to him to know that I have been unable to get the information required. If it requires legislation, will he consider it so that hon Members can get answers, as they are entitled to expect?	1995-05-24a.900.7	person/22605	person/22653	True	1995-05-24	major	False	False	0	Scotland	Scotland	Tourism	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

The hon Gentleman can use the consultation period on the passenger service requirement to put his points forward.	1995-05-24a.900.10	Will the Minister undertake to explain the methodology that he and his colleagues, particularly the Secretary of State, have so misleadingly employed with respect to the passenger subsidy for Scottish rail services? Many people believe that the figures that have been produced for sleepers, for example, are entirely unreliable and are designed to deceive the Scottish public about the cost of those vital services.	1995-05-24a.900.9	person/10396	person/22653	False	1995-05-24	major	False	False	0	Scotland	Scotland	Tourism	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1995-05-24.16.0	I am not. This year, some £900 million will be invested in housing. It is one of the top priorities for all district authorities in Scotland, which have strategic responsibility. We have given a considerable amount of grant to voluntary organisations, concentrating on prevention rather than cure, and have allocated £29 million for special schemes to assist with homelessness. In addition, we recently issued a consultation paper on a subject in which the hon Gentleman is interested—anti-social tenants. He is welcome to make observations during the consultation period.	1995-05-24a.901.3	Does the Minister accept that current levels of homelessness are unacceptable in any civilised society? Will he admit that housing associations alone cannot cope, and will he explain why he is starving local authorities of the resources required to solve that problem?	1995-05-24a.901.2	person/10628	person/17208	True	1995-05-24	major	False	False	0	Scotland	Scotland	Homelessness	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1995-05-24.16.1	The hon Gentleman forgets that the most recent Labour Government cut capital expenditure on housing to the bone. As I mentioned, about £900 million will be provided this year in housing investment. We anticipate that, some time during the year, the 300,000th house will be built since 1979, which is a considerable achievement, much of it by the private sector but some by the public sector.	1995-05-24a.901.5	Is it not true that, under the present Government, both public and private sector housing starts have been crucified? When will the Minister stop the policy of taking away with one hand what he allows with the other to local authorities for public expenditure on housing? Is it not an indictment of the Government's economic policy and their crucifying of the building industry and of their lack of moral imperatives in the way in which they treat the homeless? If he had attended to both economic policy and moral imperatives, would not the Minister and his party stand a chance—just a chance—of avoiding the humiliation that confronts them at the Perth and Kinross by-election?	1995-05-24a.901.4	person/10501	person/17208	False	1995-05-24	major	False	False	0	Scotland	Scotland	Homelessness	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

However, I will certainly ensure that the Minister of State is made aware of the hon Gentleman's opinions.	1995-05-24a.902.1	Does the Minister accept the fact that the east end of Glasgow has some of the worst health statistics in Scotland and in the United Kingdom? Will he therefore deplore the proposals to close Belvidere hospital in Parkhead, which cares for elderly people in my constituency—or is he happy for it to be sold off or privatised à la Stonehaven?

1995-05-24.17.1	The hon Gentleman must appreciate that there will be consultation. I wish to make it quite clear that, since trusts have been established, waiting times have shortened, more people are receiving treatment and there has been increased investment in improving hospitals. However, as I explained earlier, the purpose of the private finance initiative is to ensure that public sector funds go very much further, with higher standards for the patients.	1995-05-24a.902.3	Does the Minister recall that it is but a few years since he was trumpeting the virtues of the national health service trust system?

Is he aware that a recent report into a school in my constituency, Bayble school, by Her Majesty's inspectorate said that it was dangerous, smelly and suffering from chronic disrepair?

I shall be discussing with the British Film Institute a strategy for the use of modern methods of cinema technology, which I hope will include the interests of film societies.	1998-04-20a.461.10	I congratulate my right hon Friend on an excellent report, which I hope all right hon and hon Members will read. I am sure that my right hon Friend shares my concern about the increasing difficulty that a number of film societies have in obtaining prints of new releases, especially when they are restricted to being able to show films on 16 mm equipment. I am sure also that my right hon Friend agrees with me that we do not want to force the closure of all our town and city-centre film venues, thereby forcing everyone to get into his or her car to go out of town.

1998-04-20.0.1	First, it does not help when the hon Gentleman gets his facts considerably wrong. Secondly, it does not help when he talks down Britain when people abroad are investing in British films. We want to encourage them to do so. The previous Government left not one penny to the Labour Government to save the London Film Commission. In spite of that, my right hon and hon Friends produced £100,000. Working with others, we saved the commission. It is delighted, as the hon Gentleman should be.	1998-04-20a.462.0	"Is the Minister aware that it is becoming harder and harder since 1 May to attract international film makers to this country because of the strength of the pound?

The hon Gentleman, having been parliamentary private secretary to the right hon Member for South-West Surrey (Mrs. Bottomley), the previous Secretary of State, will know the difficulties surrounding the concession scheme. It is probably full of anomalies and imperfections. Our Department receives more correspondence about this matter than almost any other. It is genuinely a difficult matter. To extend the existing concession scheme to all pensioner households would cost, at latest figures, £471 million. That is a considerable sum, which we shall have to examine carefully when we come to the review.	1998-04-20a.462.5	I thank the Minister for his answer, but the House will be aware that, before the recent Budget, there was much floating of a trial balloon by the Government in relation to suggestions that there would be free television licences for all pensioners.

Tory Cabinet Ministers were chauffeured from across the road to the House to vote down a Bill that would have given tremendous help to many pensioners.

1998-04-20.2.0	On the general point, the hon Gentleman and others can debate those matters when the National Lottery Bill is discussed. With regard to Southport pier, he led a delegation, which I was delighted to meet, and its members spoke fluently for their cause. To help the hon Gentleman and his constituents, I should say that this is a matter for the heritage lottery fund, which expects to receive a revised application; it would be in their interests to submit it as soon as possible.	1998-04-20a.463.4	I thank the Minister for our recent meeting, which was helpful. The Secretary of State said in the lottery debate that his criterion would be that lottery funding would go to people rather than to buildings. I agree, but piers do not come into the category of buildings or into any other category: they are one of their own. Southport pier attracts 144,000 people each year, but it is in need of repair, and we need lottery funding. Will the Minister put piers in a different category when heritage funding is considered?	1998-04-20a.463.3	person/10196	person/10116	True	1998-04-20	blair	False	False	0	Culture, Media And Sport	Culture, Media And Sport	Piers (Lottery Funding)	0	liberal-democrat	False	False	labour	True	False

1998-04-20.3.0	I entirely agree, and I am delighted that the hon Gentleman is obviously getting some early midsummer night's dreaming in with his Rude Mechanicals. Of course he is right. It is a well made point because it is the community arts, and particularly the non-professional arts, that contribute so much to cultural life and do not receive enough consideration either in the House or in the media.	1998-04-20a.464.1	I thank the Minister for that answer. Does he agree that many genuinely community-based groups in every aspect of the arts—for example, the Rude Mechanicals theatre group in my constituency—are benefiting or should benefit from funding through the Arts Council or through lottery funding every bit as much as high-profile organisations such as Covent Garden?	1998-04-20a.464.0	person/10624	person/10198	True	1998-04-20	blair	False	False	0	Culture, Media And Sport	Culture, Media And Sport	Arts	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
1998-04-20.3.1	My hon Friend makes a very good point. It is underlined by, for example, last year's report of the associated board of the Royal Schools of Music, which shows a worrying trend and a decline in the number of people learning and teaching music. My right hon Friend the Secretary of State and I are examining the matter with considerable urgency, and hope to make a substantial announcement later in the summer, with some new initiatives to kick-start the teaching of music in schools and for young people. The new initiatives that we are providing in the National Lottery Bill may help us to do that.	1998-04-20a.464.3	Will my hon Friend consider carefully the question of music in the sense both of music making and providing music? In the north-west, we have a vigorous tradition of excellent music, but, sadly, it looks as though some music teaching is to be abandoned in the education service, which is very worrying. It will deprive us of a whole sector of important cultural activity.	1998-04-20a.464.2	person/10181	person/10198	False	1998-04-20	blair	False	False	0	Culture, Media And Sport	Culture, Media And Sport	Arts	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
1998-04-20.3.2	No. We have no such plans, although, as part of our departmental spending review, we are examining the whole way in which our Department allocates its expenditure. On the right hon Lady's first point, she must not continue to make a point that she knows is not correct. As a result of the national lottery, £10 billion comes to cultural life and the good causes. That money is still coming, and it is going to do good throughout the country. She should recognise and welcome that.	1998-04-20a.464.5	In view of the pressure on the arts budget, particularly now that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has helped himself to so much lottery funding, does the hon Gentleman have any plans to ensure that some of the major national London arts groups are funded directly by his Department rather than through the Arts Council? Does he intend that the Royal Opera house or English National Opera will be a direct client of his Department, as the museums are, and will no longer be, as I say, the Arts Council's responsibility, which would clear its desk, so that it could help the arts outside London more evenly?	1998-04-20a.464.4	person/10058	person/10198	False	1998-04-20	blair	False	False	0	Culture, Media And Sport	Culture, Media And Sport	Arts	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
1998-04-20.4.0	Yes. Both those issues, which my hon Friend has rightly raised—the development of educational initiatives in museums and galleries and the ability of people with physical impairment to gain physical access to museums and galleries—would fall specifically within the province of the heritage lottery new fund. Dudley museum will, I am sure, be interested in putting in an application for consideration.	1998-04-20a.465.4	I thank my right hon Friend for that answer, and congratulate him on the moneys that have been made available. I raise two issues for the longer term. The first concerns education packs. As a matter of policy, Dudley museum does not charge, but it does have to charge for education packs, even though teachers can freely reproduce them. The other issue concerns, I am sure, other museums—physical access. Many of the museums are in older buildings. Physical access is difficult for older people and disabled people. For example, in Dudley museum recently, we had an exhibition on the first world war. Many older people had great difficulty getting in. Will my right hon Friend take those two points into account in the long term?	1998-04-20a.465.3	person/10140	person/10547	True	1998-04-20	blair	False	False	0	Culture, Media And Sport	Culture, Media And Sport	Museums And Galleries (Dudley)	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

1998-04-20.5.1	My hon Friend raises an extremely important point. The regional character and flavour of programme making, especially in the ITV network, has been one of the great strengths of independent television over the years. Sadly, it was put in some danger by the changes introduced by the previous Government, who seemed completely uninterested in quality and interested only in the price tag when they changed the franchising system. We have made it very clear to the Independent Television Commission that we regard it as one of its prime duties to uphold the regional character and the regional sourcing of programmes when it considers matters relating to ITV.	1998-04-20a.466.0	"Is my right hon Friend aware that many of us who live in the regions

are more concerned about what happened to cross-border television and independent regional television services under the previous Government, when many of us lost our independent regional broadcasting? Is it not about time that we reminded the viewing public of that? Will the Labour Government make sure that there are independent news services and local community services when companies such as Granada Television, which took over Yorkshire Television, become part of a much greater sector?"	1998-04-20a.465.10	person/10534	person/10547	False	1998-04-20	blair	False	False	0	Culture, Media And Sport	Culture, Media And Sport	Media Mergers	0	labourco-operative	False	False	labour	True	False

1998-04-20.6.0	"My hon Friend makes a very interesting point. I welcome, as I am sure he does, the dialogue between film and television, and the interest of both in training. My hon Friend is right to draw attention to the fact that total revenues of spectrum estimates indicate a turnover from the creative industries as a whole of around


£55 billion, £12 billion of which is generated from exports. Creative industries like those to which he referred are of the utmost importance to my Department and to my right hon Friend the Secretary of State, and my hon Friend can be sure that we share his values."	1998-04-20a.466.7	The figures that my right hon Friend has just given go some way to illustrating the importance of these industries. Given their impact on employment and the balance of payments, and given also that they brighten the quality of our lives, is there not a case for adding to the help, support and encouragement that he has already given them, especially in respect of training, which has suffered badly from the fragmentation of the television industry? That would enable us to do better at combating the huge advantage that the Americans gain from their huge domestic market, and the huge advantage that the French have from cultural and linguistic subsidies.	1998-04-20a.466.6	person/10436	person/10116	True	1998-04-20	blair	False	False	0	Culture, Media And Sport	Culture, Media And Sport	Drama And Television	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
1998-04-20.6.1	It ought to be said that, with regard to the film industry, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has been the most generous Chancellor in history. In his Budget, within eight weeks of being in government, he gave a three-year, 100 per cent. write-off to film production. On the day that the document that I have in my hand was published, in which the review group—consisting in the main of people from the film industry, from television and from skill set involved in training—recommended an extra year, the Chancellor outdid even that and gave an extra two years, so things are not going too badly.	1998-04-20a.467.1	Is it not the case that most people who work in the film industry originally trained in television, not only at the BBC but with independent companies? Although I welcome the last Budget, which helped the film industry, will the right hon Gentleman urge the Chancellor of the Exchequer also to give some thought to withholding tax, which at present is still a disincentive for some American film companies to come to the United Kingdom, even though they invest here in large numbers?	1998-04-20a.467.0	person/10193	person/10116	False	1998-04-20	blair	False	False	0	Culture, Media And Sport	Culture, Media And Sport	Drama And Television	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False

There has been a very positive response.	1998-04-20a.467.3	My hon Friend the Minister will know that the film review recommended that the broadcasting industry—which makes tremendous use of film—should contribute to the all-industry fund.

In her letter she referred to a dyslexia centre in her constituency, and said:  The changes in direction— the changes we are proposing in the Bill—  should provide an excellent opportunity for them. I wonder if you could brief me on the likely timetable in which applications will be received for the new opportunities fund. Opposition Members are seeing the wonderful opportunities that will come about through the legislation.	1998-04-20a.469.4	Will not the National Lottery Bill result, effectively, in the decisions on which projects in Burton are supported by lottery funds being taken by Ministers?

1998-04-20.9.0	My hon Friend is absolutely right. This should not be a matter of favouring particular parts of the country because of their political affiliation. It should be about ensuring that there is a fair geographical spread across the country and that issues of social deprivation are properly taken into account. Both will result from the changes in direction and legislation that we are proposing.	1998-04-20a.470.0	"Does my right hon Friend agree that one of the things which characterised the lottery when it was

It is clear that somebody was making a serious attempt to ensure that we did not get much of a return. Since the Labour Government are in charge, will my right hon Friend remedy that and help those areas of social deprivation?

Will he consider calling for an audit, local authority by local authority, of facilities for teaching cricket and of incentives to youngsters to learn? On each estate in constituencies such as his and mine, places could be marked out as nets—it is very simple—so that kids could play cricket in the yard just as they play football and other games. If that happened, we might get people who could win some test matches for us.	1998-04-20a.470.6	person/10298	person/10547	True	1998-04-20	blair	False	False	0	Culture, Media And Sport	Culture, Media And Sport	Cricket	0	liberal-democrat	False	False	labour	True	False

1998-04-20.11.0	"My hon Friend makes a good point, with which I agree. It is extraordinary that some people in this country like to carp and sneer at our creative industries and at what they call ""cool Britannia"". My hon Friend is right to draw attention to the Business Strategies report of last week, which noted that the creative industries contribute some £50 billion to our national economy and that they will be the fastest-growing source of new jobs between now and 2006. While I am on the subject of jobs, I should say that in today's Evening Standard, it is estimated that millennium tourism will create 50,000 new jobs. That is what the Evening Standard calls a ""jobs bonanza"".

We are still discussing with the Treasury the precise details of the inquiry. I am therefore not in a position to give the hon Gentleman that information this afternoon.	1985-10-21a.5.0	"Will the right hon Gentleman tell us more about the inquiry that he is initiating and who

1985-10-21.1.0	My right hon Friend the Secretary of State for Wales discussed this when he met the chairmen of health authorities on 26 July. It was agreed that health authorities could manage for the year 1985–86 within the resources available to them. Of course we recognise the difficulties when health authorities have to accept pay rises that are higher than those for which they budgeted. My right hon Friend will continue to keep the matter under review, especially during the current public expenditure round. It would be wrong of me to look forward to 1986–87 while those discussions are taking place.	1985-10-21a.5.5	May I take this opportunity to congratulate my hon Friend on his very well-merited appointment? Is he aware that if local health authorities are obliged to fund nationally-agreed pay increases out of budgets which were not prepared in expectation of those increases. their ability to maintain their level of services may be impaired, including the provision of matching finance for projects for which large sums of money have been raised by local effort?	1985-10-21a.5.4	person/18450	person/22628	True	1985-10-21	thatcher	False	False	0	Wales	Wales	Nhs Staff (Pay)	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

Member for Conwy (Mr. Roberts) was due to have a series of meetings with the health authorities. We plan to go ahead with those meetings. As for any changes that may be made to the services in Gwynedd, this is a matter for that health authority to decide. I am prepared at that meeting to discuss with it any issues that may arise."	1985-10-21a.5.7	I too, welcome the Under-Secretary of State to his new and onerous responsibilities. I hope that he will have an enjoyable, though brief, spell in the Welsh Office. Will the hon Gentleman give an assurance that the meetings that had to be cancelled because of the change in ministerial responsibility, which had been arranged by his hon Friend the Member for Conwy (Mr. Roberts), will be reconvened as rapidly as possible, in particular the meeting with the Gwynedd health authority to discuss the financial position in Gwynedd arising from the impact of wage increases not being fully funded? Will he ensure that no decisions are taken in Gwynedd until that meeting has taken place and an opportunity has arisen for him to appreciate the full impact of the situation in Gwynedd?	1985-10-21a.5.6	person/10635	person/22628	False	1985-10-21	thatcher	False	False	0	Wales	Wales	Nhs Staff (Pay)	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1985-10-21.1.2	We are aware of the difficulties caused by the pay settlement. However, the issue must be seen against the background of increases in resources for the health authorities. The real growth in resources for Gwynedd between 1978–79 and 1984–85 was about 30 percent.	1985-10-21a.6.1	May I also congratulate my hon Friend and wish him success in his new job? He will receive much personal support from his right hon and hon Friends. Is my hon Friend aware that the National Health Service staff pay problem has put particular strain on the new hospital at Ysbyty, Gwynedd? Although that hospital provides facilities in excess of those provided previously. does he accept that when facilities are provided the public do not understand why they cannot be used to their full potential?	1985-10-21a.6.0	person/22348	person/22628	False	1985-10-21	thatcher	False	False	0	Wales	Wales	Nhs Staff (Pay)	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

Does the hon Gentleman acknowledge that pay increases for nurses in south Wales can be achieved only if major cuts are made in the Health Service and in facilities for patients? Is it not hypocritical of the Government to suggest that they are making extra money available when they are not even funding the full pay review award originally granted to nurses?	1985-10-21a.6.2	person/10510	person/22628	False	1985-10-21	thatcher	False	False	0	Wales	Wales	Nhs Staff (Pay)	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

In the private sector we spent £46 million compared with £12 million spent when the Labour party was in office."	1985-10-21a.6.10	Is the Minister aware of the report by the chief housing officer for Wales in which he says that we need to spend £3,000 million in the next 15 years if existing council stock is not to slip into slumdom? Would that not be a better priority for the Government than their obsession with the sale of council houses?	1985-10-21a.6.9	person/10011	person/22628	False	1985-10-21	thatcher	False	False	0	Wales	Wales	Council House Sales	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

Local authorities are, however, able to make use of other receipts in terms of their borrowing requirement. That is also important.	1985-10-21a.7.1	Does my hon Friend accept that receipts from council house sales should be used to fund further building and urgent repairs?	1985-10-21a.7.0	person/22348	person/22628	False	1985-10-21	thatcher	False	False	0	Wales	Wales	Council House Sales	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

On his point about housing stock, I must tell him that the sale of council houses in no way diminishes housing stock.	1985-10-21a.7.3	I add my congratulations to the hon Member for Newport, West (Mr. Robinson), but remind him that after the next general election he is likely to be looking for greener pastures. May I take this opportunity to remind the hon Gentleman of the terrible housing crisis that is developing in Wales? This is happening at a time when thousands of our building and construction workers are standing in the dole queues and when building materials are stacked in builders yards. Selling council houses is no substitute for building houses.	1985-10-21a.7.2	person/22158	person/22628	False	1985-10-21	thatcher	False	False	0	Wales	Wales	Council House Sales	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1985-10-21.3.0	My hon Friend is quite right. It is, of course, the responsibility of each local education authority to secure the best educational provision for children in the most cost-effective way. In 1981 we advised local education authorities to take account in their planning of the declining trend in pupil numbers, when we recommended that two out of every five surplus school places should be taken out of use by 1986.	1985-10-21a.7.8	Does my hon Friend agree that as those figures are no secret and have been known for a long time, quite a number of local authorities—including my local authority of South Glamorgan—have seriously failed to consider the merging of schools to enable the provision of a more varied range of subjects and more funding to be spent on teaching and less on mortar and bricks?	1985-10-21a.7.7	person/17607	person/21902	True	1985-10-21	thatcher	False	False	0	Wales	Wales	Secondary Schoolchildren	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1985-10-21.3.1	I cannot agree with the hon and learned Gentleman. In Wales in general, spending per head has increased from £767 in 1978–79 to;£877 in 1983–84—and that is at 1983–84 prices. There has been a similar increase in Powys from £879 to £953 per pupil. The hon and learned Gentleman is incorrect in what he claims.	1985-10-21a.8.1	Is the Minister aware of the very poor level of funding available for the education of 15-year-olds in Wales, especially in a sparse county like Powys, where in many of the high schools the heads of spending departments such as physics, chemistry and French have no more than £1 per pupil per year to spend on materials? Does the hon Gentleman agree that that is disgraceful?	1985-10-21a.8.0	person/22610	person/21902	False	1985-10-21	thatcher	False	False	0	Wales	Wales	Secondary Schoolchildren	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1985-10-21.3.2	Indeed, I have a copy of the very slim document to which the hon Gentleman referred. My description of it, quite frankly, is that it flies in the face of facts. Furthermore, it acknowledges that in its conclusions. I have no further comment on a document that states that.	1985-10-21a.8.3	Has the Minister studied the report, published a few days ago, of the National Confederation of Parent Teacher Associations, which concludes that the overall picture is of an alarming deterioration in our schools and that no amount of statistical juggling can disguise that? Certainly our teachers and local education authorities concur with that. When will the hon Gentleman's Department ensure that our educational services in Wales are properly funded?	1985-10-21a.8.2	person/22158	person/21902	False	1985-10-21	thatcher	False	False	0	Wales	Wales	Secondary Schoolchildren	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1985-10-21.3.3	My hon Friend, whom I am glad to hear, particularly as he is so conversant with this subject, had started on these very discussions with local authorities and had met the Gwent and Clwyd local authorities. I fully intend to carry on the good work that he began and to meet the remaining local education authorities.	1985-10-21a.8.5	I agree with my hon Friend and disagree with the hon and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Carlile), but do not local education authorities have a problem of resource management? Talk of cuts is political nonsense. The figures speak for themselves. They are figures put out, not by the Welsh Office, but by the LEAs. Will my hon Friend give the assurance for which I very much hope, that he will continue to discuss with the LEAs the very' difficult problem of resource management against the background of falling rolls, which is at the heart of the problem faced by LEAs in Wales?	1985-10-21a.8.4	person/16425	person/21902	False	1985-10-21	thatcher	False	False	0	Wales	Wales	Secondary Schoolchildren	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1985-10-21.4.0	The hon Gentleman will be aware that we are very concerned about the high number of unemployed school leavers that appear at this time of year on the register and account for a considerable part of the increase. Indeed, they are responsible for about 5,530 of those registered in Wales. However, I am glad to say that that number is 701 fewer than last September's figure. There are consolations for these young people, because I am glad to say that vacancies are up, being 1,500 higher this September than in September 1984. While we still regard the figures as being too high, there is hope for every youngster who has left school and is now without a job.	1985-10-21a.9.2	Does the Minister accept that, according to the October figures, 1,500 young people are registered as job seekers in Rhymney Valley and that in Mid-Glamorgan as a whole there are about 7,000? Is he aware that for those 1,500 in Rhymney Valley there is one vacancy at the careers office and that for the 7,000 in Mid-Glamorgan only 17 vacancies are registered with the careers service? In the light of those figures, will the Minister dissociate himself entirely from the view of the vice-chairman of the Conservative party, Mr. Jeffrey Archer, that the problem with young people is that they will not do a day's work and that they should get off their backsides and find a job?	1985-10-21a.9.1	person/10161	person/21902	True	1985-10-21	thatcher	False	False	0	Wales	Wales	Labour Statistics	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

While we are deeply concerned about their predicament, their prospects are somewhat better now than they were a year ago."	1985-10-21a.9.4	Will the Minister now answer the question posed by my hon Friend the Member for Caerphilly (Mr. Davies) and say whether he dissociates himself entirely from the insulting remarks of the vice-chairman of the Tory party, Mr. Jeffrey Archer, which caused a great deal of anger and bitterness among the young people in our community?	1985-10-21a.9.3	person/10516	person/21902	False	1985-10-21	thatcher	False	False	0	Wales	Wales	Labour Statistics	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1985-10-21.5.0	No. There is clear evidence from this and many other countries that high initial rates of pay as employees enter industry without skills result in more unemployed youngsters. Labour Members have expressed concern in previous supplementary questions about unemployed youngsters. They should take serious note of the fact that these youngsters are more likely to get jobs if they start at lower rates. They will then have better prospects for the future. To discount the overwhelming evidence of that fact is not to do any service for those of whom Labour Members speak.	1985-10-21a.10.1	I thank the right hon Gentleman for being good enough to write to me on this matter. Does he think that the people of Wales will swallow his explanation and accept that new jobs will be created if we remove the minimal protection that is enjoyed by low-paid workers? Does this mean that the Welsh unemployed can look forward to jobs that are low paid without regulated protection?	1985-10-21a.10.0	person/16424	person/22141	True	1985-10-21	thatcher	False	False	0	Wales	Wales	Wages Councils	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1985-10-21.5.1	That is true. There is no doubt that high basic rates for youngsters in relation to rates for adults are a key factor in deciding whether firms take on young people. There is no doubt also that the rates that have been paid to youngsters have been a factor in discouraging their employment. We should do everything that we can to bring them into work where they can be trained and where they can earn much higher rates in future.	1985-10-21a.10.3	Is my right hon Friend aware that in Germany young workers start at rates between 20 per cent. and 25 per cent. of an adult wage and ultimately secure far higher paid jobs than British workers?	1985-10-21a.10.2	person/17607	person/22141	False	1985-10-21	thatcher	False	False	0	Wales	Wales	Wages Councils	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1985-10-21.5.2	If the hon Gentleman had listened he would have heard me say that we shall not abolish the wages councils. If he wishes to talk about the protection of young people, I must put it to him that those who do not have jobs are not being protected by the wages councils. Indeed, their prospects of employment are being threatened by many of the actions of the councils. That is what we are seeking to change.	1985-10-21a.10.5	Does the Secretary of State realise that the wages councils protect about 500,000 employees and that one out of five of those who are protected are young people? Does he understand that they have suffered enough under this Government and that they do not want to return to sweatshops? I ask the right hon Gentleman and the Government to reconsider their decision to recommend the abolition of the wages councils.	1985-10-21a.10.4	person/10485	person/22141	False	1985-10-21	thatcher	False	False	0	Wales	Wales	Wages Councils	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1985-10-21.6.0	The consultations to which the hon Gentleman refers are part of the management process of health authorities in organising their priorities. He should know that five major hospital schemes have been completed since 1979, which is evidence of the Government's commitment and that of my right hon Friend to the NHS in Wales.	1985-10-21a.11.1	How does the Minister equate the propaganda from his Department and the Department of Health and Social Security about maintaining the level of expenditure in the NHS with the real experience of those of us who during the recess have visited hospitals, spoken to Health Service workers and had the privilege of attending massive public meetings in our constituencies and elsewhere at which objections have been raised to proposals for hospital closures and changes in the ambulance service? Why are health authorities in Wales going through these consultation exercises on closure proposals if there is not a real financial crisis in the NHS?	1985-10-21a.11.0	person/21720	person/22628	True	1985-10-21	thatcher	False	False	0	Wales	Wales	Nhs Expenditure	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

This is an enormously important activity and we shall be monitoring the initiative closely.	1985-10-21a.11.3	Will my hon Friend accept that there is a warm welcome for the expansion of the NHS, especially the significant increase in bone marrow transplant operations at the University hospital of Wales in my constituency?	1985-10-21a.11.2	person/22619	person/22628	False	1985-10-21	thatcher	False	False	0	Wales	Wales	Nhs Expenditure	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1985-10-21.6.2	I thank the hon Gentleman for his kind words. He has referred to the shortage of resources for health authorities in Wales. I said earlier that Gwynedd's resources had increased by 30 per cent. Mid-Glamorgan's resources have increased by 19 per cent. The first phase of the Deloitte report has been completed and the Mid-Glamorgan health authority will have to consider it. My right hon Friend the Secretary of State and I will monitor the position closely.	1985-10-21a.11.5	I congratulate the Under-Secretary of State on his appointment, and I thank his predecessor for his courtesy. Will the Under-Secretary of State heed the SOS from Mid-Glamorgan, Gwynedd and South Glamorgan? Are not patient services at risk?

I think that my hon Friend can be assured by what we have done so far and our announcement this afternoon that in reaching our decisions we shall continue to take full account of the changing situation in the area.	1985-10-21a.12.3	I thank my right hon Friend, and through him the Prime Minister, for the pressure that they brought to bear on Courtaulds to produce its comprehensive regeneration package for Greenfield. I thank my right hon Friend also for today's announcement, which will be welcomed in my constituency, and for the Government's contribution to the regeneration of the Greenfield site. This will create a healthy private and public sector partnership. Can my right hon Friend give a commitment with respect to the necessary continued urban aid and capital allocation support in the longer term so that we can speedily build on the foundations that have been so successfully laid?	1985-10-21a.12.2	person/18849	person/22141	True	1985-10-21	thatcher	False	False	0	Wales	Wales	Courtaulds Plant, Greenfield	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

I do not think that it would be in accordance with the general attitude of the clergy if the Church of England tried to ordain or lay down the thinking that should take place in their studies. Total expenditure on Auckland castle is much greater than my hon Friend has indicated, because of the historic nature of that ancient place.	1985-10-21a.13.0	Will my hon Friend assure me that the considerable sums spent on parsonages and bishops' palaces, which in 1984 included £70,000 on the palace of the Bishop of Durham, will ensure that there are adequate study facilities for all parsons and bishops, to enable more of them to comment on moral rather than political issues, including the narrow decision last week by the Law Lords to abolish the age of consent?	1985-10-21a.12.8	person/22587	person/19392	True	1985-10-21	thatcher	False	False	0	Church Commissioners	Church Commissioners	Parsonages And Bishops' Palaces	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1985-10-21.9.0	The Church Commissioners' duty is to make moneys available for the remuneration of the full-time clergy. As my hon Friend is aware, more than half the overall burden, including pensions, is now also carried by the laity. I do not believe that considerations of what will happen in the future enter into that calculation. My hon Friend is now uniquely well placed to make his views known because of the welcome news that since we last met he has been elected to the General Synod.	1985-10-21a.13.5	I thank my hon Friend for that answer. First, I welcome the fact that the Church Commissioners are paying more than the rate of inflation to support the ministry and the pay of incumbents. Does he agree that some anxiety should be shown, because about 1,000 members of the clergy have given notice that they will leave the Church of England if women are ordained and admitted to the priesthood? Will he confirm that special consideration will be given to keeping those members and the rest of the clergy happy, because we do not wish to lose more members of the clergy?	1985-10-21a.13.4	person/16827	person/19392	True	1985-10-21	thatcher	False	False	0	Church Commissioners	Church Commissioners	Stipendiary Ministry (Pay, Pensions And Housing)	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

The work is demanding physically and mentally.	1985-10-21a.13.7	When my hon Friend and his colleagues next discuss these matters, will they give further thought to the compulsory retirement age of 70, bearing in mind the fact that many men who are just over 70 are well able to look after a small rural parish, and that mother Church is often better served by a resident father than by a peripatetic priest of whatever sex?	1985-10-21a.13.6	person/10134	person/19392	False	1985-10-21	thatcher	False	False	0	Church Commissioners	Church Commissioners	Stipendiary Ministry (Pay, Pensions And Housing)	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

My hon Friend can well judge from that what any projected contributions would achieve.	1985-10-21a.14.3	Can my hon Friend give the latest official estimate of the cost of putting St. Alban's into a safe, sound and decent condition and of obtaining a fund to keep it that way?

When will the Secretary of State pursue policies that will genuinely bring down the level of unemployment? Why is he pursuing policies that will increase unemployment, through closures at MAFF at Cardiff and Bangor and the Welsh plant breeding station at Aberystwyth?	1985-10-21a.15.0	On 12 September 1985 there were 187,563 unemployed claimants in Wales.

On the second point, my hon Friend hopes to make an announcement about the allocations for next year, in December. On the matter of

post-abolition funding, as the hon Member knows, we have already committed £34 million of additional central funding for the arts after abolition. The Arts Council subsequently made a bid for more resources, which we will have to consider in the context of the public expenditure discussions. As I think the hon Member will know, that will have to await the broader considerations that are being discussed at the moment."	1985-10-21a.15.7	I hope that the Under-Secretary of State will convey to his hon Friend our regret that he is unwell. We particularly wish to assist him in his new task. Is the Minister aware that in West Yorkshire, as in other metropolitan areas, there is worry about what will happen when the metropolitan county councils are abolished? When will the Minister respond to the Arts Council's bid for £35 million to replace the metropolitan county money, and what further guidance is to be given via the rate support grant formula to assist district councils in developing their arts funding?	1985-10-21a.15.6	person/18427	person/10659	True	1985-10-21	thatcher	False	False	0	The Arts	The Arts	Regional Arts Associations	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

No one wishes my hon Friend a speedy recovery more than I do.	1985-10-21a.16.1	Since my hon Friend is in such close and frequent contact with the newly appointed Minister for the Arts, may I ask him to transmit the message that many of us hope that he will be rather more a champion at the Chancellor's door than a supplicant and defendant in the star chamber?	1985-10-21a.16.0	person/22553	person/10659	False	1985-10-21	thatcher	False	False	0	The Arts	The Arts	Regional Arts Associations	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1985-10-21.12.2	I reject the assumption behind the hon Gentleman's question. In our manifesto in 1983 we said that we would keep up the level of support for the arts, and our record shows that we have done better than that. From 1978–79 to date the central Government arts budget has more than doubled in cash terms, that is, a real terms increase of nearly 18 per cent. This year's budget is almost 6 per cent. up in cash terms on last year's budget. In the context of the very difficult decisions that the Government have had to take on public expenditure, the arts have done quite well.	1985-10-21a.16.3	We are all pleased to learn that at least the Minister for the Arts is in a better condition than I fear most of the arts are. We pass on our good wishes, and no doubt we shall meet him in a few weeks' time. Will the Under-Secretary of State remind him that the arts crisis, the cataclysmic collapse in arts funding. is the worst ever? Will he also remind him that this is due to the abolition of the metropolitan counties and the GLC? Thirdly, will he remind his hon Friend of the promise given to me on 2 August last year by the previous Minister that the present level of public support for the arts would be maintained? When are we to get that assurance from the present Minister?	1985-10-21a.16.2	person/16421	person/10659	False	1985-10-21	thatcher	False	False	0	The Arts	The Arts	Regional Arts Associations	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

As my hon Friend knows, British Rail proposed the closure of the Settle-Carlisle line and my right hon Friend the Secretary of State for Transport has a quasi-statutory role, which makes it difficult for Ministers to say anything at the moment. However, I assure my hon Friend that the heritage and tourist aspects of the line will be taken into account when my hon Friend makes his decision.	1985-10-21a.17.7	I thank my hon Friend for that reply. Bearing in mind that he has various hats, can he confirm that funds are and will be available for appropriate railway structures, including the Ribble head viaduct and, under another hat, will be ensure that the future of the Settle-Carlisle line is kept in mind by the bodies with which he has contact?	1985-10-21a.17.6	person/14200	person/10659	True	1985-10-21	thatcher	False	False	0	The Arts	The Arts	National Heritage Fund	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

Does he accept that it is counter-productive not to invest more money in the scheme, because the amount of work that it takes to hook a potential sponsor and the damage done by losing him if there is insufficient money will do little to futher the scheme?	1985-10-21a.18.3	person/17464	person/10659	True	1985-10-21	thatcher	False	False	2	The Arts	The Arts	Private Sponsorship	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

1982-05-25.10.10	That is about seven questions. I wonder which to start on. The hon Gentleman referred to the phrase in my right hon Friend's speech that the days of the Argentine garrison are numbered. Does the hon Gentleman not want those days to be numbered? We wish them to be numbered. He then called for a ceasefire while the invader was kept in occupation. We totally reject that. It would leave the whole paraphernalia of tyranny in place. Perhaps two answers will be enough for the hon Gentleman.	1982-05-25a.792.9	They are.	1982-05-25a.792.7	person/10647	person/19284	False	1982-05-25	thatcher	True	False	0	Prime Minister	Prime Minister	Engagements	1	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

Naturally, one hopes that countries such as Argentina that have nuclear power stations will join the nuclear nonproliferation agreement.	1982-05-25a.794.2	As Argentina is likely to become a nuclear weapon State in the near future, is it not essential to recognise that that would raise the stakes considerably in the South Atlantic?

That is one of the basic principles that I enunciated earlier.	1991-02-21a.418.9	Will the Minister assure the House that the internal logic of the CAP, which has driven us for so long to the destruction of wetlands, moorland, woodlands and birdlife, has been arrested and, preferably, put into reverse?	1991-02-21a.418.8	person/17238	person/10249	False	1991-02-21	major	False	False	0	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Agriculture, Fisheries And Food	Common Agricultural Policy	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

1991-02-21.0.3	My first advice is that they should support the Government's recent proposals, which would make it easier for land to be available to let. Secondly, I hope that if they enter farming, they will set out to produce goods that the public want and to narrow the gap between imports and exports of food products which was graphically exposed yesterday by Food From Britain. Thirdly, there will be a difficult time ahead because we are in a world of surplus for those who can afford it, but in such a world there will always be a place for the specialist, efficient producer who produces what the public want and at a price that they can afford.	1991-02-21a.419.5	I do not wish to make a political point——	1991-02-21a.419.1	person/22517	person/10249	False	1991-02-21	major	False	False	0	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Agriculture, Fisheries And Food	Common Agricultural Policy	2	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

The hon Gentleman does the industry no good by suggesting that the reason for the problems in the knacker and the rendering industries is other than the world problem of a low price for their products.	1991-02-21a.420.1	If the Minister wishes to close the trade gap in food, will he consider a letter that I received from a farmer in my area who is very concerned about the closure of the knackeries?

I agree that it is very difficult to see how British producers can get the best price for their milk or how British manufacturers can get the best part of the market for their manufactured products unless the system, which was designed for wholly different circumstances, is changed. If not, British producers will be supplying the end of the market that produces the least money while the top end of the market will be provided by products coming from the rest of Europe.	1991-02-21a.420.3	Does my right hon Friend agree that the consumers' ability to buy British depends on the freest possible market? In that context, does he agree that the reason why the British consumer so often has to buy French cheese or German yoghurt lies in the monopolistic and outdated practices of the milk marketing board?

On that basis, I shall decide what action to take without the benefit of any spurious advice from the hon Gentleman.	1991-02-21a.420.5	On the trade gap, did the Minister see the claim by Safeway supermarkets earlier this week that it had to import 70 items of food which could be grown in Britain because British suppliers could not guarantee quality, consistency or price? If that is true, it is a massive indictment of our agricultural support system. Will the Minister set up an inquiry into that allegation, which has also been made to me from other quarters?

1991-02-21.1.0	I accept that the woodland option under set-aside has not proved as popular as we had hoped. That is why we are examining the relationship between the farm woodlands scheme and all the other woodland schemes to determine whether we can put together a better package. We intend to draw up a consultation paper and I shall take particular care to forward it to the farmers of Esher. If we wish to carry out experimental work, no doubt they will volunteer for it	1991-02-21a.421.1	My hon Friend gives rather disappointing figures. Will he try to galvanise the famers of Esher— [Laughter.] I should have thought that that would be taken seriously. Will my hon Friend try to galvanise the many farmers of Esher into adopting the woodland option so that we can add woodlands to the green belt and have all the attractions of woodlands, with their waving trees, dells, glades and cover for pheasants?	1991-02-21a.421.0	person/10587	person/10149	True	1991-02-21	major	False	False	0	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Agriculture, Fisheries And Food	Set-Aside Scheme	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1991-02-21.1.1	In the early stages of the set-aside scheme, when whole farms could be taken out of production, people may have been able to level the accusation that it was payment for doing nothing. In fact, that was not the case, because farmers had to maintain their land in trim. But that accusation was precisely the reason why we reduced the incentives for whole-farm set-aside. We have steadily increased the environmental element of set-aside, because that is the best justification for the scheme. We intend to take the Countryside Commission's East Anglia premium scheme nationwide and we are looking hard at its environmental benefits. If set-aside becomes one of the centrepieces of the eventual Community reform programme, we shall wish to ensure that it is closely associated with environmental objectives.	1991-02-21a.421.3	Perhaps one reason why farmers have not been keen on set-aside is that it appears that farmers are being paid for doing nothing. But it is an opportunity to use public money in a desirable way, because it encourages the creation of woodland. If land is to be set aside, it should be used in ways that encourage wildlife and promote conservation. I know that there are Premium payments for doing that. Will the Minister give an assurance that farmers will be encouraged to participate in the woodland schemes, particularly for urban and community forestry? The schemes enable farmers to take their land out of production and put it into forestry for the benefit of themselves and the community in general.	1991-02-21a.421.2	person/10444	person/10149	False	1991-02-21	major	False	False	0	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Agriculture, Fisheries And Food	Set-Aside Scheme	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

1991-02-21.2.0	Of course, I am aware of the concern about the use of sheep dips. Two organophosphorous sheep dips and one alternative are currently available. We should be very happy if anyone were to come to us for approval with a new sheep dip that did not contain those materials, provided that the new dip met all other standards of safety, quality and efficacy. Such dips, which contain potent materials, are necessary to deal with the nasty problem of sheep scab. That is why there are strict warnings on the labels and a scheme to encourage anyone who is adversely affected to report it to our independent advisory committee.	1991-02-21a.422.3	Is the Minister aware of the widespread concern about the use of organophosphorous sheep dips?

1991-02-21.2.1	When the veterinary products committee reviews sheep dips, it will keep in mind the problem of whether any residue is left on the animal or ingested into its system.

However, at the National Farmers Union I spoke about the environmental changes that we should make and which I consider a necessary part of CAP reform. I hope that we shall reform the CAP to make it better. Some of the suggestions that have been made would make it decidedly worse. We need to ensure that farmers can do their two jobs—produce the food that we need and look after the land that we care about.	1991-02-21a.423.0	When the Minister goes to Brussels, will he bear in mind the urgent need for change, given that the GATT round has restarted? Will he consider the information, which I imagine was passed to him by the director general of the Nature Conservancy Council, that 80 per cent. of damage to sites of special scientific interest in Britain is caused by bad farming? Will he make it an urgent priority in the reform of the common agricultural policy to introduce green premia along the lines advocated by the Labour party?	1991-02-21a.422.9	person/10246	person/10249	True	1991-02-21	major	False	False	0	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Agriculture, Fisheries And Food	Agriculture Reform	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1991-02-21.3.1	My hon Friend is both a farmer and someone who takes a great deal of interest in farming, but it is an odd view of our membership of the European Community—or of the world community—that we should be self-sufficient in everything. The German Government took such an autarkic view in the past. It would not commend itself to democrats or anyone with a liberal view of trade.	1991-02-21a.423.2	Given that within the European Community Britain is one of the least self-sufficient countries in terms of food and agricultural produce, I wonder whether my right hon Friend would be kind enough to give a simple undertaking to the House today that he will not agree to anything coming out of Brussels which will reduce still further our self-sufficiency in food and agricultural produce?	1991-02-21a.423.1	person/18333	person/10249	False	1991-02-21	major	False	False	0	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Agriculture, Fisheries And Food	Agriculture Reform	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1991-02-21.3.2	I do not know of many farms in the United Kingdom that could not be classified as family farms. The idea that a family farm must have less than about 30 acres is nonsense. Some family farms hold and look after four or five families and that is how British agriculture has generally developed. The real distinction to make is between farms of a realistic size that are able to support a family and farms that we know perfectly well cannot produce an acceptable income as standards rise in countries such as Portugal, which traditionally have had tiny farms. We want to help such farms to reach a more sensible base so that they can support the people who run them. Farming in this country is efficient and very much able to compete. I am determined that it should be able to continue to do so. As 80 per cent. of production is achieved by 20 per cent. of farms covering nearly 70 per cent. of the land area, it is not surprising that they receive 80 per cent. of the support.	1991-02-21a.423.4	In the ongoing debate on common agricultural policy reform it has been suggested that only large farms are economic and efficient. Will the Minister take this opportunity to refute that suggestion? Does he accept that many smaller farms in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are equally efficient? Is not there something wrong with the CAP when 80 per cent. of funds available are directed to only 20 per cent. of farmers?	1991-02-21a.423.3	<UNKNOWN>	person/10249	False	1991-02-21	major	False	False	0	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Agriculture, Fisheries And Food	Agriculture Reform	0				<UNKNOWN>	False	False

However, we believe that the reform must be cash-limited. It is absolutely indefensible that the British taxpayer and consumer currently pays £13·5 million a day to support the common agricultural policy. Why is the Minister so dismissive of the suggestion of my hon Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths), along Labour party lines, for the payment of a green premium? I know that the Minister likes the idea—why will not he discuss it with us and acknowledge that the green premium not only gives us environmentally sensitive farming, but provides us with a sensible agricultural support system and is more economical to the consumer and the farmer?	1991-02-21a.424.1	person/10108	person/10249	False	1991-02-21	major	False	False	0	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Agriculture, Fisheries And Food	Agriculture Reform	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

1991-02-21.4.0	Let us get one thing straight from the start. There would be no knacker industry in Britain if the Parliamentary Secretary, my hon Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry), had not pulled off a marvellous coup in Brussels just before Christmas, when he protected the whole knacker industry for at least the next five years. My Department is taking strenuous action to ensure that there are alternative systems available. The knacker industry can continue collecting dead animals. We are giving help and advice to farmers on other disposal methods. We are spending £800 million per year in general support for the livestock industry. I do not think it reasonable to ask the taxpayer to spend any more money on specific subsidies to farmers. We shall take strenuous action against anyone dumping animals by the roadside.	1991-02-21a.425.3	Has the Minister noted what Mr. John Logie wrote in Farmers Weekly of 25 January? Mr. Logie is a leading member of the Scottish knackery industry and is greatly concerned about the number of knackeries that are closing in Britain. In particular, there is great concern about the number of farmers leaving animal carcases to rot in the countryside. Mr. Logie wrote: It is really beyond belief that the Government is ignoring what could become a major health hazard. It would be terrible if the public were poisoned before something is done.

His suggestion that European surpluses should be sent to the third world would do positive damage to the third world by simply wiping out local production. To suggest getting rid of our surpluses by using the third world as a dustbin does no good to European agriculture and would be a major disservice to the third world.	1991-02-21a.426.2	Will the Minister admit that, despite all the set-aside schemes and attempts to run down the industry, surpluses in intervention stocks are increasing again? Does he agree that at a time when every family is paying £16 a week to prop up the common agricultural policy, and when we have the cock-eyed MacSharry proposals before us that will make matters worse, it would make more sense if those stocks of food found their way into empty bellies in the third world instead of being wasted as they are now?	1991-02-21a.426.1	person/10544	person/10149	True	1991-02-21	major	False	False	0	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Agriculture, Fisheries And Food	Intervention Stores	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1991-02-21.5.1	What I have discovered is that we must have an agricultural policy that is closer to the marketplace and the consumer. I am afraid that the formula that my hon Friend suggests would have precisely the opposite effect.	1991-02-21a.426.4	When will my hon Friend discover what ought to be self-evident—that only by a quota policy can we ensure that agricultural support goes to the producers of food, not to the storers of food or the exporters of subsidised food?	1991-02-21a.426.3	person/18362	person/10149	False	1991-02-21	major	False	False	0	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Agriculture, Fisheries And Food	Intervention Stores	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1991-02-21.5.2	I suggest that the hon Gentleman reads the speech by my right hon Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to the National Farmers Union. It spells out clearly what we have said for years—that farming must get closer to the marketplace and that institutional prices have to come down. We have to make sure that farming is compatible with the environment and that its job is to supply what people want to eat. There is nothing very original about that. It is common sense, and common sense is the hallmark of the Government's policies.	1991-02-21a.426.6	We all agree that a system of agricultural support that does not benefit producers or consumers but rewards people who store food, people who destroy food and people who dump food cannot be justified and has to be reformed. We know which reforms the Government oppose. Why are they so coy about giving details of the reforms that they would like to see?	1991-02-21a.426.5	person/10161	person/10149	False	1991-02-21	major	False	False	0	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Agriculture, Fisheries And Food	Intervention Stores	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1991-02-21.6.0	I am sure that my hon Friend agrees that the announcement today that resumption looks likely is very encouraging. I wholly agree that we shall get a solution to the GATT round only if those participating stop addressing themselves to the columns of newspapers and sit down in a conference room at a table from which they do not get up until they have found a solution.	1991-02-21a.427.1	My right hon Friend is a doughty fighter in Europe for British industry. He has heard today the many concerns about the cost, waste, fraud and protectionism associated with the present CAP. Does he agree that there should be an early resumption of the GATT round of talks? Perhaps it is time for delegates to be locked in a room until they reach agreement.	1991-02-21a.427.0	person/18022	person/10249	True	1991-02-21	major	False	False	0	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Agriculture, Fisheries And Food	Gatt	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1991-02-21.6.1	I am happy to agree with the hon Gentleman's analysis. I think that he will agree that it is the British attitude which has very much won the support of the European Community. It is we who got the Community to put its proposals to the GATT round. We have kept the Community at that negotiating table and we have supported the Commission in fighting to negotiate on those terms. We have also stopped those in the Community who wish to resile from those negotiations from succeeding. Britain can say that the successes so far are based upon British initiative and support.	1991-02-21a.427.3	What influence can the Minister bring to bear on the EEC to make sure that there is a resolution of the conflict in the GATT round? As he well knows, the GATT round of talks is crucial not only to agriculture but to other industries, notably the textile industry which in Bradford in my constituency faces difficulties because of high interest rates. The uncertainty of the GATT round indicates a difficult and dark future. Can the Minister tell the House what influence, if any, he can and will bring to bear in the European Community?	1991-02-21a.427.2	person/16389	person/10249	False	1991-02-21	major	False	False	0	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Agriculture, Fisheries And Food	Gatt	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1991-02-21.7.0	I think that the hon Gentleman is taking a rather simplistic approach to combating food poisoning. We have a whole host of measures to deal with food poisoning, not least the Food Safety Act which came into effect on 1 January this year. The Act gives widely and greatly increased powers to environmental health officers and others to implement the law without a huge increase in resources being necessary, but we have also provided an extra £30 million for local authorities to help enforce the Food Safety Act.	1991-02-21a.428.2	Is the Minister aware that there is general concern about the increase in food poisoning, as illustrated by a sixfold increase in the Trent region in the past seven years? Does he agree that local authority environmental health officers have an important part to play in combating food poisoning, but that their task is being made far more difficult by an insufficiency of financial resources?	1991-02-21a.428.1	person/10418	person/10394	True	1991-02-21	major	False	False	0	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Agriculture, Fisheries And Food	Food Poisoning	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1991-02-21.8.0	I can confirm to my hon Friend that we are particularly attentive to the needs of the processing industry and that when it comes to the cutting of restitutions we should get full restitution for the raw material components of processed foods. I know that the confectionery industry runs up a balance of payments surplus of about £100 million a year and that is particularly important to it.	1991-02-21a.428.7	Will my hon Friend confirm that in the conclusion to the current GATT rounds, no competitiveness will be lost in connection with United Kingdom food and drinks exports, particularly the great confectionery industry based in cities such as York?	1991-02-21a.428.6	person/22614	person/10149	True	1991-02-21	major	False	False	0	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Agriculture, Fisheries And Food	Food And Drink	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1991-02-21.9.0	Since Britain has become a member of the European Economic Community we have increased the amount of self-sufficiency in the dairy industry. One of the sadnesses of the present situation is that although we are only 86 per cent. self-sufficient, we are still manufacturing some of the lower-cost products, with lower returns to producers, because of our milk marketing system. So we need to reform that as a matter of urgency. What I will say to the hon Gentleman is that I am not prepared to have a greater reduction in quotas in this country than occurs in other member countries of the European Community. The MacSharry plan proposes exactly that. I believe in fair shares for all.	1991-02-21a.429.0	"We have heard a lot of rhetoric from the Minister today about buying British, but, as British dairy farmers are not allowed to produce more than 86 per cent.


of the milk consumed in this country, will the Minister state categorically that he will not accept any further cut in the United Kingdom milk quota? Would not it be monstrous for the efficient farmers of north-west England and elsewhere to have to pay the price for inefficiency and overproduction in the rest of Europe?"	1991-02-21a.428.11	person/10421	person/10249	True	1991-02-21	major	False	False	0	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Agriculture, Fisheries And Food	Common Agricultural Policy	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

1991-02-21.10.0	I very much agree with my hon Friend. The only message that we wish to hear today is that Iraq is prepared to accept and implement all the Security Council resolutions in full and immediately. That is a message which can be given to us at any time. As I told the House on Tuesday, only when such a message is received and has begun to be implemented can there be an end to the conflict.	1991-02-21a.430.0	"Bearing in mind the horrors that have been perpetrated in Kuwait, where thousands have been murdered and tortured, and bearing in mind also the awful nature of the weapons available to Saddam Hussein, does my right hon Friend agree that there can be no doubt that the implementation of all the United Nations resolutions is both a just and a necessary cause? Does he also agree that since August Saddam Hussein has had every opportunity to withdraw from Kuwait, and that if a major

land offensive should now be necessary our forces will carry with them the gratitude and good will of the entire nation?"	1991-02-21a.429.9	person/10615	person/10408	True	1991-02-21	major	True	False	0	Prime Minister	Prime Minister	Engagements	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1991-02-21.10.1	It has certainly been made clear by the allies that we stand by the Security Council resolutions in full. As the House may know, I understand that, within the past few minutes, Saddam Hussein has begun broadcasting to Iraq. There is no indication yet of what he has said or what he will say, but I am bound to say that he preceded his broadcast with yet another Scud attack.	1991-02-21a.430.2	Will the Prime Minister confirm that within the past 48 hours every one of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council has made it crystal clear to Saddam Hussein yet again that if immediate and unconditional removal of all Iraqi forces were to take place the fighting could end? Does the Prime Minister agree that that is what the whole world wants—including, had they but the freedom to say it, the ordinary people of Iraq? Knowing that, is not it obvious that of all the many cruelties committed by Saddam Hussein, the greatest would be his failure to take the opportunity, which has always existed and still exists, to avert a major land battle and the great suffering that it would bring?	1991-02-21a.430.1	person/13171	person/10408	False	1991-02-21	major	True	False	0	Prime Minister	Prime Minister	Engagements	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

1991-02-21.10.3	I very much agree with the right hon Gentleman, particularly about durability and security. There is no need for particular peace proposals. The peace proposals that we wish to hear are those that we have set out and agreed with our allies and others in the United Nations Security Council resolutions. That has been and remains the position. If Iraq is prepared to accept and implement those, the conditions exist for an end to the conflict. Without that, they do not exist.	1991-02-21a.431.0	"Does the Prime Minister agree that no one, but no one, can relish the prospect of having to fight a land war in the Gulf, that even at the 11th hour every realistic avenue for peace ought to be pursued, but that we cannot allow ourselves to be distracted by culs-de-sac designed to delay the freedom of Kuwait? Will he confirm that the aim of the allies is not a temporary peace, leading


to conflict later, but a durable, United Nations-based peace, a basic ingredient of which must be recognition of the legitimacy of Kuwait?"	1991-02-21a.430.7	person/10015	person/10408	False	1991-02-21	major	True	False	0	Prime Minister	Prime Minister	Engagements	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

Last year, crime fell in Hampshire by 7 per cent.; burglaries were down by 14 per cent.; and robberies were down by 14 per cent. I accept my hon Friend's point, however, that the criminal justice system is a seamless robe and that all parts of it must work in harmony if the public and our constituents are to be assured that there is justice. The House has given the courts powers to impose sentences of up to 14 years for burglary, 10 years for killing someone while drink-driving, five years for inflicting bodily injury and life imprisonment for unlawful wounding. I suggest that any public indignation at a perceived failure to use the extensive powers that the House has granted should be directed at those responsible for sentencing.	1995-02-09a.439.16	May I make my hon Friend aware of the concern of many people in Portsmouth who are particularly sensitive about crimes of drunken, late-night violence and vandalism associated with clubs similar to the one in Aldershot?

Does that not sum up the lack of confidence in law and order enforcement that many people feel?

The whole purpose of making payments under the tariff scheme during the interim judgment while we await the ultimate judgment is to ensure that people do not have to wait longer than necessary for their money.	1995-02-09a.441.6	Will those 51,000 victims of violent crime be further disadvantaged by having to wait another period before receiving payment in compensation?

Leaving aside the dubious legality of how he sought to change the scheme, which still hangs in the balance, will he now admit the obvious: that victims of the most serious crimes of violence will not gain under his scheme and that compensation for those who suffer the most horrendous attacks and therefore need that compensation most, including police and fire officers injured in the course of duty, will be slashed?	1995-02-09a.441.7	person/10431	person/10290	False	1995-02-09	major	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Criminal Injuries Compensation	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1995-02-09.3.0	Questions relating to the detention or release of Private Clegg are a matter for my right hon and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.	1995-02-09a.442.4	Will the Home Secretary use the powers at his disposal to free Private Lee Clegg at the earliest opportunity? Is he aware that I have received many more letters about the plight of Private Clegg than I have received, for example, about veal crates, because my constituents are outraged at the fact that that British soldier is serving a life sentence for murder, having become entangled in that terrible situation simply because he was doing his duty?	1995-02-09a.442.3	person/18926	person/22613	True	1995-02-09	major	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Convicted Murderers (Release)	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1995-02-09.3.1	As I have already said, the issue of Private Clegg is a matter for my right hon and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. I am sure that the hon Gentleman is aware that the mandatory life sentence enables my right hon and learned Friend, on an individual basis, to decide on the basis of risk whether a life prisoner may be released and on the basis of appropriate retribution and deterrence the length of sentence that should be set as a minimum as part of the tariff-setting procedure.	1995-02-09a.442.6	Is it not a fact that if the Home Secretary relinquished his powers to interfere in judicial decisions and got rid of mandatory life sentences, the problem concerning Private Clegg would never have arisen, because the judge would have been able to sentence him appropriately?	1995-02-09a.442.5	person/10042	person/22613	False	1995-02-09	major	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Convicted Murderers (Release)	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1995-02-09.3.2	I entirely agree with everything that my hon and learned Friend has just said. Obviously, it was part of the arrangements made following the abolition of the death penalty for murder that the Home Secretary should have a role in deciding the length of sentence that would be served as part of the tariff-setting procedure. It is important that that ability to set a tariff, on the advice of the judiciary, and to assess whether a prisoner will be released on licence, should take account of risk to the whole community, and that that power should rest with the Home Secretary.	1995-02-09a.442.8	Does my right hon Friend share the view that the public expect that the most heinous of all crimes should be visited by the most serious of all punishments; that life imprisonment is the substitute for capital punishment, which the House gave to the country in 1965; and that, if that is right, those who seek to require that judges decide how long a prisoner shall serve for the crime of murder have a difficult case to prove?	1995-02-09a.442.7	person/21906	person/22613	False	1995-02-09	major	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Convicted Murderers (Release)	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1995-02-09.4.0	Perhaps I could point out to the hon Gentleman that before the 1993 Act, the average time taken on those cases was 18 months, so seven months is an improvement on that. I share the anxiety expressed by the hon Gentleman about the time that is being taken, and am urgently considering, in conjunction with the Lord Chancellor's Department, ways in which we may reduce those times, precisely. to deal with the problems that the hon Gentleman describes.	1995-02-09a.443.4	Is it not a fact that that appalling backlog and the long time taken for consideration are caused by the immigration service being overstretched and underfunded? Is the Minister aware that there are more than 5,000 of those cases in my borough of Newham alone? That is 10 per cent. of all applications. Is he aware of how much pressure that puts on the people who are waiting for a decision, and how much pressure it puts on the hard-pressed services of Newham in terms of housing, social services and education? Will he give further resources to the immigration service and speak to his comrades—friends—in other Departments, so that boroughs such as Newham can be given additional resources to tackle the problem?	1995-02-09a.443.3	person/10025	person/22346	True	1995-02-09	major	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Asylum Seekers	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

1995-02-09.5.0	They are getting it. The Government's comprehensive drugs strategy commands expenditure of more than £500 million throughout Departments. The hon Gentleman should not misrepresent the proposed changes to Customs and Excise. They will not detract from the effectiveness of the customs response to drug smuggling. The proposals are designed to enhance and develop existing strategies, and to provide better flexibility and better targeting for customs operations against drug smuggling. Customs and Excise assures me that there will be no customs-free port or airport in the United Kingdom. It will be able to make flexible use of regionally based, mobile, anti-smuggling teams and that represents a good response to the problem.	1995-02-09a.444.7	I wonder whether the Minister has seen the letter sent to the Home Secretary by the local section of Parents Against Drug Abuse in my constituency in which those parents expressed their concern at the closure of the Customs and Excise operations at Ellesmere Port and the fact that no police officers are dedicated solely to the task of policing the drugs problem. Does he not understand that that failure to monitor that port leaves the door wide open for drugs? Does he not believe that children in my constituency and right across the country deserve better protection than that?	1995-02-09a.444.6	person/10435	person/10394	True	1995-02-09	major	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Drug-Related Crime	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

advocate the legalisation of so-called ""soft"" drugs understand the nature of the problem with which we are dealing. The signal that would be given to our young people, to the effect that some drugs are okay to mess about with while others are not, would be disastrous. That is the view of the police force and Her Majesty's Government."	1995-02-09a.444.9	Will my hon Friend confirm to the House that the Government have no plans to legalise any drugs that are currently banned in the United Kingdom?	1995-02-09a.444.8	person/22624	person/10394	False	1995-02-09	major	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Drug-Related Crime	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

I was slightly surprised that when we are discussing the legalisation of drugs the right hon Gentleman from the Liberal party should rise on cue, as the Liberal party is one of those ridiculous organisations that believe in the liberalisation of some soft drugs.	1995-02-09a.445.1	Is the Minister aware of newspaper reports that the Security Service, MI5, is seeking a role in dealing with drug-related crime? Although it may have the capacity to assist in dealing with drug trafficking and money laundering, will Ministers bear it in mind that much of the work to combat drug-related crime depends on working closely with communities? Many police forces are doing just that and are accountable for that work to local communities in a way that the Security Service cannot be.	1995-02-09a.445.0	person/10034	person/10394	False	1995-02-09	major	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Drug-Related Crime	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1995-02-09.5.3	I have read some articles in some trendy newspapers which were given to me suggesting that some champagne socialists can pass the pot around at dinner parties quite safely. No doubt, some people can safely handle some drugs and know when to stop, but many more do not. The signal that legalisation would give young people in particular—that it is safe and trendy to participate in drugs—would be absolutely disastrous. It would lead to the use of harder drugs and would make the task of the police infinitely worse. The police are totally opposed to it, as are all right-thinking people. The Government remain totally opposed to legalisation.	1995-02-09a.445.3	Does my hon Friend agree that the fight against drug-related crime can be enhanced by a proper public understanding of drugs? Is he aware that there are now certain varieties of cannabis which cause hallucinations and can exacerbate conditions such as phobias and even schizophrenia? In those circumstances, does my hon Friend share my view that those who regard some drugs as only recreational and safe send out entirely the wrong signal in the fight against drug-related crime?	1995-02-09a.445.2	person/10561	person/10394	False	1995-02-09	major	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Drug-Related Crime	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1995-02-09.5.4	I fail to see the consistency. The hon Gentleman has just pointed out the incorrectness or daftness of the decision which has come from a European organisation on legislation which was passed with the full support of the House. I share the hon Gentleman's concern that there should be an attempt to make us remove those powers. We shall need to reflect carefully on the judgment. The hon Gentleman then said that the problem could be solved by incorporating the European convention into British law, but I do not see how that could be achieved. I shall debate it with my right hon and learned Friend the Home Secretary. The hon Gentleman has lifted what my right hon and learned Friend said and is apparently proposing it as Labour party policy. It does not make sense of the judgment to attempt to incorporate it into English law. We shall look carefully at the judgment, but the whole House shares the indignation at the decision that those jurists have reached. It is not the view of the British Government. We have robustly defended our corner; we shall reflect on it, but we remain convinced that the laws are appropriate for dealing with drug dealers.	1995-02-09a.446.0	"My hon Friend the Member for Knowsley, North (Mr. Howarth) made clear to the Minister our opposition to the legalisation of cannabis, and that remains the case. On the alarming decision this morning by the European Court of Human Rights to declare unlawful certain aspects of the Drug Trafficking Offences Act 1986, let me make it clear to the Minister that we fully supported those provisions—including the retrospective provisions—when they came before the House in January 1986, and that remains our position. I believe that the court made a bad decision that the British public will find almost impossible to understand. It is entirely right that those who profit from drugs should be hit in their pockets. Does the Minister also accept the view of the hon and learned Member for Burton (Sir I. Lawrence), the Chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, that the problem might have been avoided had the European convention been incorporated into English and Scots law? [HON.

to stir up racial hatred an arrestable offence. We have very strong laws in place and we hope that they will be enforced. On the hon Gentleman's second point, we welcome the recommendations in the Home Affairs Select Committee report on racial attacks and harassment. We were not able to accept every recommendation, but much of the work called for in that report is already being carried forward by the interdepartmental racial attacks group. On the question of Hizb ut-Tahrir, I am aware that the Jewish community is very concerned about the activities of extreme Islamic groups. If any group engages in illegal activities, it is liable to be dealt with using the full force of the law. I believe that the laws that we have in place are effective in dealing with precisely the kind of literature to which the hon Gentleman referred."	1995-02-09a.446.5	Will the Minister go further and take up all the proposals of the Home Affairs Select Committee and the Labour party to strengthen the law in that area? Is he aware that I wrote to the Home Secretary on 1 November and forwarded to him material which was sent to me by Lady Birdwood and her racist organisation? I have received a reply from the Director of Public Prosecutions saying that he is not prepared to prosecute in that instance. Is the Minister also aware that Hizb ut-Tahrir, an extremist organisation, has been issuing leaflets in my constituency calling for death to Jews, and that the Radio Authority recently gave a broadcast licence to an organisation associated with Hizb ut-Tahrir?

It is for the Merseyside fire and civil defence authority to set a budget for 1995–96, in the light of the criteria for council tax capping. That budget should allow it to comply with its statutory duties to provide fire cover.	1995-02-09a.449.4	In response to that fully complacent reply, the Home Secretary should study the situation on Merseyside and throughout the country. On Merseyside, the shortfall in the Government's assessment of our needs is £2.9 million, even to stand still. If the authority were to carry out the Government's statutory growth requirements, the shortfall would be £4.7 million. How can the Government justify that? The Merseyside chief fire officer is saying that he cannot make cuts other than in pumping appliances and closing stations.

1995-02-09.9.0	The Warwickshire constabulary can spend up to 2.5 per cent. more in the coming year than this year. It is possible, moreover, for police forces to ask the Home Office for funds in exceptional circumstances—to provide cover for special events—but not for on-going or regular policing. As for police numbers, the House should be aware of the statistics. I have seen surveys carried out by some members of the police service that suggest that officer numbers may fall next year. If that is so, it is because of a decision by the police service. Overall it received about 4 per cent. more this year. For me, the telling statistic is that 21 police forces are receiving over 5 per cent. more, and some are receiving increases of more than 10 per cent.; yet only four say that they will recruit more bobbies. If all those forces that are receiving a great deal more money choose to spend it on other matters, that is their decision and I will not criticise them, but the hon Gentleman should not criticise me if chief officers do not retain the same number of police officers.	1995-02-09a.450.0	"Does the Minister accept that for many constabularies this has been a very harsh settlement? The

Association of Chief Police Officers has said that 900 jobs may go, and the Police Federation has put the figure higher. Many forces, such as Warwickshire, have particular problems. A continuing public order problem at Baginton airport will put great pressure on its funds. Is not it time that the Home Office provided special allocations for forces in areas with on-going public order problems, so that they are not hit by station closures at the end of the year and do not have to sack officers because insufficient funds are available to support our police properly?"	1995-02-09a.449.10	person/10461	person/10394	True	1995-02-09	major	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Police Funding	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

It is important that, in the question of priorities in all local authority budgets, and particularly in education budgets, education authorities look carefully at the right education priorities for the children in our schools. That may well apply to Somerset county council, to which my right hon Friend refers. It applies equally to many other education authorities.	1995-02-09a.452.1	Does my right hon Friend recall the attack on Tuesday by the right hon Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) about being forced to sack teachers? Is my right hon Friend aware that the right hon Gentleman is, at this moment, supporting the Liberal Democrat leadership in Somerset, which is insisting on sacking teachers, even though Conservative councillors have put forward proposals so that those jobs need not be lost, and for ways in which the education in the county can be protected? Is not that symptomatic of the Liberal Democrat party, which is more interested in scoring political points than in genuinely seeing how the education of children can be protected?	1995-02-09a.452.0	person/10342	person/10408	False	1995-02-09	major	True	False	0	Prime Minister	Prime Minister	Engagements	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

I see no evidence that a single currency is inevitable as a result of that, nor do I share the view of the hon Gentleman, which he clearly holds as it becomes more apparent that the Labour party is already wedded to a single currency, whatever the economic circumstances may be. That is the only implication which can possibly be drawn from the hon Gentleman's question. I simply have to say to him that I disagree with him.	1995-02-09a.455.0	Why does the Prime Minister think that a free market operating between countries that has got rid of all our trade barriers will not inevitably lead to a single currency?	1995-02-09a.454.9	person/10556	person/10408	False	1995-02-09	major	True	False	0	Prime Minister	Prime Minister	Engagements	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

1997-10-28.2.2	I am pleased to tell my hon Friend that one of the positive effects of Madeleine Albright's visit was a sharp reduction in the Israeli Government's closure programme. I fully endorse my hon Friend's general points. The closure process has resulted in a sharp increase in unemployment and a loss of economic trade throughout the Palestinian entity. It is important that the Israeli Government should take on board the fact that they are unlikely to succeed in the peace process if the Palestinian people find that, throughout the peace process, their standard of living goes down rather than up.	1997-10-28a.692.4	The Minister will be aware that I recently visited the west bank and Gaza to see for myself the effects on the ground of the Israeli policy of internal closures. Those policies have resulted in Gaza being shut off for, on average, one day in three over the past three years. They have resulted in 65 per cent. unemployment and in Palestinians suffering from less freedom of movement than was the case before the Oslo agreement was signed, which has obviously had a detrimental effect on Palestinian public opinion. Can the Minister assure me that he is taking action to make representations to the Israeli Government, either directly or through the European Union, to get them to stop the unproductive policy of internal closures?	1997-10-28a.692.3	person/10564	person/10130	False	1997-10-28	blair	False	False	0	Foreign And Commonwealth Affairs	Foreign And Commonwealth Affairs	Middle East Peace Process	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
1997-10-28.3.0	My hon Friend is absolutely right to say that there is a need for reform of the common agricultural policy. That need would be there even if enlargement of the European Union were not under consideration. The fact that enlargement is a top priority for the British presidency of the EU means that we shall give top priority in the negotiations in Luxembourg in December to seeking reform of the agricultural system in order to bring prices more in line with world prices.	1997-10-28a.693.2	Does my hon Friend agree that, desirable though enlargement is, it is incompatible with the common agricultural policy in its present form?

1997-10-28.3.1	The answer to the first question in yes; we will protect the abatement. The answer to the second question is that we are firm in the belief that the Edinburgh criteria on the future size of the aggregate budget—1.27 per cent. of gross national product—should be a sticking point. During negotiations with our European partners, we have realised that there is increasing consensus behind that position.	1997-10-28a.693.4	Will the Government give a commitment that they will protect Britain's rebate from the European Community budget in those negotiations? Will they further make a commitment that, in those negotiations, they will press for reform of the complete European Community budget to bring about a sharp reduction in the unacceptably large contribution that we now make to the European Community?	1997-10-28a.693.3	person/10613	person/10272	False	1997-10-28	blair	False	False	0	Foreign And Commonwealth Affairs	Foreign And Commonwealth Affairs	European Union Enlargement	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False

Achieving a way forward on structural funds, the budget, agricultural policy and enlargement are top priorities in our negotiations.	1997-10-28a.693.6	Given that the Minister has agreed that common agricultural policy reform, along with structural reform and many other essential reforms, must precede any enlargement of the European Union, what measures did the Government take at Amsterdam to ensure that progress was made on those issues?

1997-10-28.3.3	I visited Turkey three weeks ago and raised those issues with the Turkish Government. I made it clear that, while Britain believes that there is a strong case for Turkey to be included in the European conference because of its important geo-political situation and other reasons, it cannot be without condition. Turkey must improve democracy, and that involves a change of attitude to the Kurdish community, progress on human rights and economic reform. All those points were made to the Turkish Government as well as specific representations in respect of the recent incidents to which my hon Friend refers.	1997-10-28a.694.0	"The Government have been critical of Turkey and its human rights record.

His Government could not even find a dialogue with the other European Union countries, never mind have any influence on them. He is the last hon Member I would have expected to raise that question. In relation to the 10 countries plus Cyprus seeking membership of the European Union, I can assure the hon Gentleman that we support the European Commission proposals that negotiations should begin with five countries plus Cyprus, but other understandings on the way forward for the other five countries should be an important focus of the negotiations at Luxembourg.	1997-10-28a.694.2	Do the Government now regret not pushing the agenda for enlargement more energetically at Amsterdam? Does the Minister regret pushing for deepening rather than widening the EU? Will he clarify his Government's policy?

Frankly, it was desperately needed. Many of my constituents have suffered as a result of the delays caused by the breakdown of the previous system. It occurs to me that, since the installation of the new system, there has been a reduction in the number of applications and


fewer people have been able to visit their relatives here.

We warmly welcome the fact that the Prime Minister of India has initiated such a bilateral dialogue and we were glad that we were able at the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting to ensure that both of them had the opportunity to have a further bilateral dialogue, which I understand went well.	1997-10-28a.695.7	Will my right hon Friend confirm that he recognises that there is considerable international concern about the on-going conflict in Kashmir between India and Pakistan, in which more than 1,000 people have been killed in the past 12 months? During recent months, there has been renewed shelling over the line of control. Will he make it clear that it is the Government's policy to give full support to the bilateral talks between India and Pakistan, with the hope that that leads to a conclusion of the conflict, while recognising that Pakistan and India have more to gain than anybody else from the solution to the problem?	1997-10-28a.695.6	person/10479	person/10130	True	1997-10-28	blair	False	False	0	Foreign And Commonwealth Affairs	Foreign And Commonwealth Affairs	Kashmir	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

Has he had the chance to see the United States State Department report, which has described the line of control between India and Pakistan in Kashmir as the most dangerous flashpoint in international relations today—both sides of course having nuclear potential?	1997-10-28a.696.7	person/10218	person/10130	False	1997-10-28	blair	False	False	0	Foreign And Commonwealth Affairs	Foreign And Commonwealth Affairs	Kashmir	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

1997-10-28.6.0	My hon Friend raises a real question. The Bosnian Serbs should learn the clear lesson given by the Bosnian Croats when Kordic and the other nine Bosnian Croats went to The Hague to face the charges against them. We expect the same from all indictees, whether Bosnian Serbs or Bosnian Croats. On the question of the return of refugees, my hon Friend will be glad to know that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has a programme to return 100,000 refugees this year. Already, 83,000 have returned and the programme is on course. That is good news. Progress has been made and will continue to be made.	1997-10-28a.697.6	Are not the Bosnian Serbs driving a coach and horses through the Dayton accord by refusing to hand over indicted war criminals to the court in The Hague?

1997-10-28.6.1	Let me place on record that we work closely with the Americans and all our allies in Bosnia. Progress is being made. For example, the problems caused by corruption have seen Mrs. Plavsic break with the Pale crowd, including Karadzic and his cronies, in her anti-corruption drive. We have seen the seizure by the Stabilisation Force of the transmitters in Pale, which stopped the transmission of the daily messages of hate. Transmissions will be stopped until we get an agreement from the Bosnian Serbs in Pale that messages of hate are a thing of the past. We have seen an effort by our troops in Prijedor in arresting indictees, which gives a signal to all indictees that we expect to see them at The Hague. We shall see them at The Hague. Progress is being made, because all the allies are working together in the Dayton framework.	1997-10-28a.698.0	"The Minister said that he was keeping pressure on the three parties concerned.

If so, he should look at all the faces around him and consider the commercial interests represented by his hon Friends. We have published clear guidelines for the sale of defence equipment and we will judge every export licence against those criteria. We will take no lectures from the hon Gentleman and other Conservatives who, when in government, armed Saddam

Hussein and cost this country £750 million of taxpayers' money. The Conservatives have no right to talk on these issues—their record is appalling."	1997-10-28a.699.7	I am sorry that the Minister has not got to grips with this matter. The decision to sell Hawk jets was made by the previous Labour Government two or three years after the takeover of East Timor. The House and the country would like to know why the Government, who are looking at ethical issues in arms sales, believe that we should not sell Land Rovers to Indonesia some 22 years after the takeover of East Timor, whereas the previous Labour Government sold jets to Indonesia a couple of years after that country—some say because they were urged to do so by the American and British Governments at the time—took over East Timor. It is a confusing issue.

We know where that policy leads: it led to the arming of Saddam Hussein and to the loss of taxpayers' money. It is time that the hon Gentleman and his colleagues understood the failures of the previous Government and recognised the new Government's positive policies.	1997-10-28a.700.3	Is not the truth that, considering the licences for arms sales to Indonesia that were disallowed by the previous Government and the licensing of Hawks under the present Government, foreign policy is neither more nor less ethical than it was before 1 May? The only victim of the soundbite diplomacy of the past six months has been the British national interest, as we learn that Malaysia has signed a £1 billion contract for patrol ships with a German company, when Vosper Thornycroft thought that it was in pole position, and that Turkey says in effect that we will be disbarred from a $7.5 billion export market. British jobs and the national interest are bearing the burden of soundbite politics.	1997-10-28a.700.2	person/10051	person/10195	False	1997-10-28	blair	False	False	0	Foreign And Commonwealth Affairs	Foreign And Commonwealth Affairs	Indonesia	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False

Most of those killed on the Pan Am jet were Americans, and the majority of their relatives do not want a trial to take place outside Scotland or the United States.	1997-10-28a.701.1	Since one of the reasons given by the Foreign Secretary for objecting to a trial on Lockerbie in The Hague is that the Americans might refuse to submit evidence that they held to a court outside Scotland or the United States, can we reflect on why the Americans should do that? Is there a suggestion that the Americans might be unwilling, after nine years, to give information to the Dumfries and Galloway police?	1997-10-28a.701.0	person/10152	person/10130	True	1997-10-28	blair	False	False	0	Foreign And Commonwealth Affairs	Foreign And Commonwealth Affairs	Lockerbie	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
1997-10-28.9.1	If I may correct the hon Gentleman, what happened at Lockerbie was not a disaster; it was murder. No one in the House should forget that. I find it strange that it should be argued that a trial by Scots judges under Scots law in another country would be fair, but a trial by Scots judges under Scots law in Scotland would not. We have nothing to be defensive about concerning the impartiality of our courts, and I shall be proud to display that when I meet the delegation.	1997-10-28a.701.3	As the interest of those who lost their relatives in the dreadful disaster is that a trial should take place and the guilty parties be identified and punished, is the Foreign Secretary really saying that there are no circumstances in which he will consider a trial outside Scotland, especially as the Libyans have already said that they would willingly surrender the two accused to an independent party—perhaps Egypt—if the trial were held in any third country?	1997-10-28a.701.2	person/10591	person/10130	False	1997-10-28	blair	False	False	0	Foreign And Commonwealth Affairs	Foreign And Commonwealth Affairs	Lockerbie	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
1997-10-28.9.2	The hon and learned Gentleman makes some fair points about the nature of the Scottish legal system. It is, after all, the legal system to which we subject our citizens. I see no reason why there should be a separate system for those from Libya, but I understood that other countries may not be so persuaded. That is why I have made in good faith the offer that we are willing to discuss any reservations that other countries may have, confident in the knowledge that we can put them right. We would welcome monitors and observers from them at a trial so that justice could not only be done but be seen internationally to be done.	1997-10-28a.701.5	I welcome the Foreign Secretary's announcement of the invitations that he has extended. Is the assertion that no fair trial can be obtained in Scotland not only unfounded but unnecessarily provocative? If the test of fairness of a judicial system is transparency, does not the Scottish system stand comparison with many others, including the Libyan system? May not fairness be established by the presence of independent observers at every stage of the legal process?	1997-10-28a.701.4	person/10088	person/10130	False	1997-10-28	blair	False	False	0	Foreign And Commonwealth Affairs	Foreign And Commonwealth Affairs	Lockerbie	0	liberal-democrat	False	False	labour	True	False

I do not believe that the conditions that were agreed in Amsterdam in any way detract from that important objective.	1997-10-28a.703.4	Are not the processes of ever-closer union via economic and monetary union inimical to job creation and sustainment?

Will we seek to use the presidency to establish a European code of conduct on arms sales to ensure uniformity of policy across the European Union in line with our ethical foreign policy so that where we do not grant arms export licences, these are not taken up by other countries?	1997-10-28a.706.5	person/10496	person/10130	True	1997-10-28	blair	False	False	0	Foreign And Commonwealth Affairs	Foreign And Commonwealth Affairs	Eu Common Foreign And Security Policy	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
1999-10-25.0.0	Yes, I can give the hon Lady that assurance.	1999-10-25a.685.10	I am grateful to the Minister for that reply.

given the changes made in the other place to a Bill that has not yet completed its passage through the other place, I cannot answer his question in detail."	1999-10-25a.685.12	I welcome the Minister to his first Question Time in his current capacity. On appointment, he was the fourth pensions Minister in 27 months, so I wish him luck. I understand that the Minister may be reluctant to adopt a position that is being urged on him by the Opposition, but has he decided whether pensioners, and stakeholder pensioners in particular, should be obliged to take their pension in the form of annuity at the age of 75, or whether he intends to sweep away that rule for stakeholder and other appropriate pensions?	1999-10-25a.685.11	person/10603	person/10511	False	1999-10-25	blair	False	False	0	Work And Pensions	Social Security	Stakeholder Pensions	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False

1999-10-25.0.3	I saw the report in the Financial Times , although I have not seen the document to which it refers. I got the impression under the previous Government that everyone was awash with funds. The vast majority of those at whom stakeholder pensions are targeted—people on moderate earnings, say between £10,000 and £20,000 a year—have no second pension provision. We estimate that their total earnings amount to £60 billion a year, and we believe that allowances and second pension provision can be made from that.	1999-10-25a.686.3	What provision will the Government make to ensure that adequate advice is available to those who take out stakeholder pensions? According to the Financial Times , no less than half the population of the United Kingdom have total savings of less than £750. Is that not a disturbing comment on the lack of real disposable income, and does that not make it all the more important that the investment choices to be made through a stakeholder pension are properly made?	1999-10-25a.686.2	person/10636	person/10511	False	1999-10-25	blair	False	False	0	Work And Pensions	Social Security	Stakeholder Pensions	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
1999-10-25.1.0	"I understand my hon Friend's frustration with the system that we inherited, where the average wait for an appeal decision was seven months. Clearly, if the average waiting time is seven months, some cases will go on for much longer. The backlog of old appeals, which in February stood at 70,348 cases, which was 50 per cent. of all outstanding appeals, was down to 15,405 in September, as a result of the changes that we have made in decision making and appeals. That is a


substantial improvement, and I take this opportunity of complimenting the staff of the tribunal service, who have done so well to produce that result."	1999-10-25a.686.8	I thank my hon Friend for her response. I welcome the setting up of a new appeals procedure, which we hope will prevent unacceptably long delays in making decisions. One of my constituents, who suffered from myalgic encephalomyelitis, had to endure 18 months before his appeal was won. Can my hon Friend give us an assurance that all the old appeals will be tackled in the near future?	1999-10-25a.686.7	person/10655	person/10182	True	1999-10-25	blair	False	False	0	Work And Pensions	Social Security	Appeals	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
1999-10-25.1.1	I have never heard such nonsense in my life; I am afraid that the hon Lady is living in fantasy land. It is quite clear that streamlining, which maintains people's proper rights, had to be introduced for the cumbersome appeals procedure that we inherited, and that is what we have done.	1999-10-25a.687.1	Does the Minister accept that the appeals procedure was reviewed only because of pressure exerted by the Opposition? Will the hon Lady, on behalf of the Government, undertake to go back on the means-testing provision that is written into the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill, to avoid a burdensome appeals procedure when that comes into force?	1999-10-25a.687.0	person/10389	person/10182	False	1999-10-25	blair	False	False	0	Work And Pensions	Social Security	Appeals	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
1999-10-25.1.2	I certainly agree with my hon Friend and also, I hope, can reassure her that one of the main principles behind the changes to appeals procedures is avoiding the need for appeals altogether. In other words, we want to collect the evidence properly and ensure that benefit is awarded correctly first time so that we can take a lot of appeals, which are caused by mistakes and confusion, out of the system completely.	1999-10-25a.687.3	Although everyone welcomes the clear acceleration in the hearing of such appeals, will my hon Friend bear it in mind that there is some doubt about the quality of some of the evidence that is being given to tribunals? Many of the most vulnerable people in our society are losing their benefits and having to appeal. The length of time in which an appeal is heard is essential. I know that she understands that, but will she keep a close eye on the situation?	1999-10-25a.687.2	person/10181	person/10182	False	1999-10-25	blair	False	False	0	Work And Pensions	Social Security	Appeals	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
1999-10-25.2.0	"The hon Gentleman asked me about ensuring that pensioners receive the benefits to which they are entitled. It is a deep cause of concern that some pensioners are not receiving the benefits to which they are

entitled because of the barriers to claiming. Some of them believe that they still have to go to the social—to the office—to claim, for instance, income support or the minimum income guarantee. That is not the case. Claims can be made through a home visit or, in some parts of the country, over the telephone. The hon Gentleman has asked about the important issue of take-up of benefits before. An estimated 800,000 pensioners are not receiving the benefit to which they are entitled and for which the House has legislated, and we want to do everything we can to encourage take-up. There will be a Government-sponsored take-up campaign next spring."	1999-10-25a.687.8	I am grateful to the Minister for that deeply illuminating reply. What explanation can he give pensioners who are claiming benefits today of the fact that their basic state pension is worth only a fraction of what it would have been worth had it been placed in a fund when they were making their national insurance contributions?	1999-10-25a.687.7	person/10355	person/10511	True	1999-10-25	blair	False	False	0	Work And Pensions	Social Security	Pensioners	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
1999-10-25.2.1	I thank my right hon Friend—and, indeed, the hon Member for Windsor (Mr. Trend)—for their welcome. My right hon Friend is absolutely correct. Indeed, of the estimated average number of pensioners not taking up their entitlement to income support—which varies between 530,000 to 870,000; one cannot be precise—230,000 are single females aged over 80, so there is a major problem. The figure for single males aged over 80 is 40,000. When I walked into the Department of Social Security, I thought that, by twiddling the keys on my keyboard, I would be able to bring up the information necessary for finding those people in a detailed and systematic way, but the way that the information technology arrangements in the Department have been made in recent years prevented that from happening, which is why we need a Government-led take-up campaign. On my right hon Friend's further point, he will know better than I do that we cannot make a decision that could have consequences for 10, 20 or 30 years on one year's figures for the national insurance fund.	1999-10-25a.688.1	I also congratulate my hon Friend on his new post. Can he confirm that, generally speaking, the poorest pensioners are the oldest pensioners and that the national insurance fund is, to use a phrase he used a moment ago, awash with funds? Can he also confirm that the Government have records of pensioners aged over 80, because we pay them a few extra pennies a week, and that perhaps the most effective way of tackling pensioner poverty would be to give an increase of about £15 to those pensioners?	1999-10-25a.688.0	person/10197	person/10511	False	1999-10-25	blair	False	False	0	Work And Pensions	Social Security	Pensioners	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
1999-10-25.3.0	No, it is not. I shall deal first with the national benefits hotline. We receive about 13,000 to 14,000 calls a month on the hotline, and from 1 November we shall spend nearly £500,000 on another advertising campaign because we believe that the public support and information that we get are invaluable in support of the fight against fraud. Since we came into office, we have increased by a third the number of serious cases that are prosecuted, which has resulted in a 50 per cent. increase in custodial offences. Many of the spotlight on fraud campaign features that worked have been incorporated into the Department's fight against fraud. I remind the right hon Gentleman that, at the end of his term as Secretary of State, two out of every five income support cases were being paid without sufficient evidence to justify them. Because of the changes that we have made to ensure that we get benefit claims right in the first place, we shall save £1 billion on that benefit alone during this Parliament.	1999-10-25a.689.0	"I thank the right hon Gentleman for that reply, but can he confirm that the truth is that the


Government have run down the beat-a-cheat line and closed down the spotlight on fraud campaign, which was succeeding in saving more than £100 million a year? They have so starved the Benefits Agency fraud investigation service that it has had to shut down its operations because of lack of money. Is not the truth that the Government have gone soft on fraud?"	1999-10-25a.688.6	person/10362	person/10153	True	1999-10-25	blair	False	False	0	Work And Pensions	Social Security	Fraud	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
1999-10-25.3.1	That project was wound up—it was run not by my Department but by London boroughs—because of internal difficulties that made it impossible for it to carry on. That decision was taken by the London boroughs responsible for it. I remind the hon Gentleman, that in addition to ensuring that we get income support cases right, since October we have insisted that every claimant establishes his identity before his claim can be accepted, which never happened under the Conservatives. We have stopped the Post Office redirecting housing benefit cheques to bogus addresses, something that the previous Government did not pursue. We have ensured that the benefit fraud inspectorate examines the 30 councils that spend the most on housing benefit to ensure that their procedures are tightened up, and we are now cross-checking information held by the Inland Revenue, the Benefits Agency and local authorities. There are more inspections because we are concerned not just about detecting fraud, but about preventing it from entering the system in the first place. Above all, the approach that we are now adopting is not only more robust, but supported by the National Audit Office, which, as the hon Gentleman should know, expressed concern about the DSS accounts in just about every year that the Conservatives were in office.	1999-10-25a.689.2	Surely that smells of complacency. Is the Secretary of State aware that, in the last year of the previous Government, we achieved our fraud savings target by more than £50 million, whereas he is below his target by some £200 million? He says that he is not soft on fraud. Why, then, has he cancelled LOFIT—the London Organised Fraud Investigation Team?	1999-10-25a.689.1	person/10240	person/10153	True	1999-10-25	blair	False	False	0	Work And Pensions	Social Security	Fraud	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
1999-10-25.3.2	I agree with my hon Friend. It is important that not only the Benefits Agency but the local authorities that administer the housing benefits scheme understand that fraud is a serious problem. It undermines the general public's confidence in the system and is bad for the perception of those who legitimately claim housing benefit. We have offered much help to councils to ensure that they have access to Benefits Agency systems, that we all hold the same information and that we get claims right. We started a joint initiative with councils to ensure that housing benefit cheques are not redirected to bogus addresses. All the steps that we are taking are causing a significant change of culture in the system, because we must make inroads into the sums lost in the past through fraud and error.	1999-10-25a.690.0	"Will my right hon Friend congratulate Westminster council on its anti-fraud strategy, which has resulted in one of its Tory councillors spending some time at Her Majesty's pleasure?

assure me that his new anti-fraud strategy will be implemented by councils throughout the country, because fraud is completely unacceptable, wherever it is found?"	1999-10-25a.689.3	person/10332	person/10153	False	1999-10-25	blair	False	False	0	Work And Pensions	Social Security	Fraud	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
1999-10-25.3.3	No, what we are asking is that everyone who claims benefit must establish his or her identity, which means producing either a national insurance number or sufficient information to ensure that we can identify the national insurance number. The problem in the past was that many officers paid out benefit without checking that people were who they said that they were. It is all very well for Opposition Members to sneer, but for 18 years they did absolutely nothing about those problems.	1999-10-25a.690.2	My right hon Friend referred to claimants having to establish their identity at the point at which they receive benefit.

1999-10-25.3.4	I do not agree with the right hon Gentleman. If he had thought for just one moment before he asked his question, he would have realised that the Government have taken many initiatives with local authorities. I mentioned the service that will prevent redirection of housing benefit cheques, and the fact that we are giving local authorities, for the first time, access to the Benefits Agency system to ensure that the information that we all hold is exactly the same. We are sharing information in a way that never happened in the past. In addition, we have set up two pilot projects to find better ways of ensuring that the Benefits Agency and councils work together, so that there is one interview with an individual, the same information is held by both organisations and we get claims right. The difference between this and the previous Government is that we are determined to tackle the causes of fraud and error rather than spending all our time trying to chase the symptoms. I think that the majority of the public would support us in doing that.	1999-10-25a.690.4	Surely what the Government have been doing has undermined the efforts of local authorities to tackle this serious problem. Will the Secretary of State give us details about the amount of successful fraud detection by local authorities between, let us say, May 1997 and now?	1999-10-25a.690.3	person/10206	person/10153	False	1999-10-25	blair	False	False	0	Work And Pensions	Social Security	Fraud	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
1999-10-25.4.0	My hon Friend makes some important points, and I can give him the assurance that he seeks. The training that personal advisers receive will be tailored to their individual needs. For instance, someone who has previously worked as a disability employment adviser will have different training needs from someone who has worked on housing benefit. To date, personal advisers have gone through an average of 200 hours training; some have received 300 or 400 hours. Particular emphasis is placed on all special client groups, although more time is spent on disability awareness than on understanding the needs of other groups. We have had input from a wide range of voluntary organisations, such as Scope, Mencap, MIND and the National Schizophrenia Fellowship, on the content of the training programmes.	1999-10-25a.691.4	I thank my hon Friend for that answer. The qualities required by personal advisers may be significant, given that they will have to analyse the capacities of people with Asperger's syndrome and other difficult conditions, and the state of the workplaces where those people may have the capacity to work. Given those complexities, will my he assure us that personal advisers will be fully trained and highly qualified?	1999-10-25a.691.3	person/10403	person/10029	True	1999-10-25	blair	False	False	0	Work And Pensions	Social Security	Incapacity Benefit	0	labourco-operative	False	False	labour	True	False
1999-10-25.4.1	"The trend in appeals shows that, as a result of the changes that our Department has made, more people are getting the right decision first time, but there is some way to go, and we shall press ahead with that. The all-work test remains the same for the gateway to incapacity benefit: we have not tightened up the system.

However, we are taking a wide range of measures to improve the quality of the advice that Benefits Agency medical services practitioners give on claims, including those involving ME. My hon Friend has taken a special interest in chronic fatigue syndrome, so he will know that the advice to personal advisers and to doctors making assessments that is published by the Department in the ""Disability Handbook"" provides much detail about ME and states that it must be taken seriously."	1999-10-25a.691.6	Does my hon Friend agree that nothing discredits the system that we inherited from the previous Government more than the all-work test? In devising a new test, will he ensure that more decisions are reached correctly at the first time of asking, so as to avoid lengthy appeals? Will he ensure that the questions asked elicit the real nature of the disability, because disabled people often say that they can perform a particular function but do not mention the extreme difficulty that they have in performing it? Sometimes that renders them ineligible for the benefit. Will he deal in particular with the problems of people who suffer from ME?	1999-10-25a.691.5	person/10049	person/10029	True	1999-10-25	blair	False	False	0	Work And Pensions	Social Security	Incapacity Benefit	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
1999-10-25.4.2	The hon Gentleman misunderstands what we are doing. We are not slackening the medical criteria; we are not changing them in any way. What we are doing is expanding the all-work test into a personal capability assessment. As well as taking into account what a person cannot do, and thereby assessing that person's entitlement to benefit, we take into account what that person can do. The information will then be fed in to assist disabled people who want to return to work to achieve their aim. According to the Government's labour force survey, 1 million people who have been consigned to life on benefits in the long term by the policies of the last Government say that they want to work, and we are providing the help and advice that will enable more of them to do so.	1999-10-25a.692.1	Is there not something rather cruel about the idea of slackening the medical criteria, while at the same time introducing means-testing for incapacity benefits? Is it really fair to fund this easing of medical criteria on the back of the savings of seriously disabled people?	1999-10-25a.692.0	person/10065	person/10029	False	1999-10-25	blair	False	False	0	Work And Pensions	Social Security	Incapacity Benefit	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
1999-10-25.4.3	We have made provision for a medically qualified person, as well as a legally qualified person, to be on the board when appeals relating to incapacity benefit are being heard. We have done that because we believe it is right. As for the arcane debate in relation to the 1998 Act, the Opposition can take responsibility for it. Nothing in the legislation prevented the Government from doing what we believed needed to be done, and that is what we have done.	1999-10-25a.692.3	Can the hon Gentleman explain the change in Government policy that occurred between the passage of the Bill that became the Social Security Act 1998, when the Government rejected Conservative proposals that there should be legally qualified chairmen and that doctors should be present when appeals were being heard requiring complex medical evidence, and the passage on 18 May this year of a statutory instrument making precisely that provision?	1999-10-25a.692.2	person/10580	person/10029	False	1999-10-25	blair	False	False	0	Work And Pensions	Social Security	Incapacity Benefit	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
1999-10-25.4.4	I would be extremely concerned if any doctor recommended that a person should return to work if work would worsen the person's condition. That is certainly not the Government's intention. I hope that this will reassure the hon Gentleman. It will be made clear to anyone discussing with a personal adviser the scope that exists for that person to return to work that any job seeking, or job taking, is entirely voluntary. Once the service is up and running, people on incapacity benefit will be required to discuss what scope there is for a return to work, but they and they alone, as individuals, will decide whether to convert that scope into job seeking.	1999-10-25a.693.0	"Will assessments of people who can perform a task take into account whether it is medically advisable for them to undertake that task? I have a constituent whose joints were damaged by a wasting disease, and who has to have replacement joints.

1999-10-25.5.0	No, I do not accept that. I think it right that, when people draw down a pension early after retiring through incapacity, and when they have a significant income, that income ought to be taken into account. I bear in mind the fact that about 300,000 people who receive incapacity benefit along with an occupational pension have an income of some £400 a week, and the fact that nearly 50 per cent. of incapacity benefit recipients with occupational pensions are in the top income brackets. I believe that the social security system needs to do far more for those who need help most. That is why we are increasing the amount of help that we give to severely disabled children by nearly £27 a week, and in some cases—involving those with particular difficulties—by more than £35 a week. If we are to do that, however, there will come a stage at which we must consider where else the system is paying benefits to people on whom, owing to changes in circumstances over the past 50 years, we might not wish to focus our activities. I believe that the principles that underpin the Government's approach are absolutely right. I have said that I am prepared to look at the detail. I am doing that and will have further proposals, but the principle that the Government's efforts are best directed towards those who need help most is right.	1999-10-25a.693.4	Does the Secretary of State accept that applying means-testing to incapacity benefit not only undermines the contributory principle, but constitutes a massive disincentive for constituents—including mine—who have disabilities, and who want to save and make provision for themselves?	1999-10-25a.693.3	person/10624	person/10153	True	1999-10-25	blair	False	False	0	Work And Pensions	Social Security	Incapacity Benefit	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
1999-10-25.5.1	I made it clear that I am and have been listening to representations over the past few months. I will have further proposals, but I repeat that I believe that the principles that underpin the approach that we are taking in this and other parts of the Bill are absolutely right. The Government have given other help to disabled people. We have introduced the disabled person's tax credit, the disability income guarantee and the new deal for the disabled—all those are new and were introduced by the present Government. None of them came from the Tory Government. The Tory opposition to this part of the Bill is wholly opportunistic. I respect the views of some of my colleagues and, indeed, some Cross Benchers in the other place. I will listen to them, but I hope that my hon Friend will accept, when he looks at what the Government are doing in the round, that we are greatly helping people who are disabled and doing far more than any Government have for those who need help most. I hope that, when it comes to the final vote, he will look at those matters in the round, support the Government and not go into the Lobby with Conservative Members.	1999-10-25a.694.0	"Will my right hon Friend listen very carefully to those on our side who have criticised his proposals, particularly those who have

campaigned for disability benefits for years on end? I have in mind Lord Ashley and Lord Morris. Will my right hon Friend bear it in mind that, although many of us recognise the improvements that have undoubtedly taken place in the past two years for many people who are affected by his Department—some of us have taken the opportunity to point that out on many occasions—there is deep concern over what is being proposed? To avoid what occurred on 20 May in the House of Commons happening again, I hope that he will bear in mind our concern."	1999-10-25a.693.5	person/10645	person/10153	False	1999-10-25	blair	False	False	0	Work And Pensions	Social Security	Incapacity Benefit	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
1999-10-25.5.2	Pensions that are drawn early after someone has retired because of incapacity are meant to replace income; incapacity benefit was originally designed in the same way. When the hon Gentleman reflects that 50 years ago, less than 30 per cent. of people had occupational pensions and that now nearly 86 per cent. of men have such provision, he will realise that we cannot go on ignoring that fact. I understand that the Liberal Democrats' view is sometimes different and that they have all sorts of spending proposals without any means of financing them. However, there comes a stage when, if we want to do more for those who are most severely disabled, particularly children who have been disabled from birth or at an early stage, we will have to look at what is happening throughout the labour market and ensure that the social security system reflects those changes. At the moment, such people are paid so little that they are living on income support for the whole of their lives. Our changes will lift them above income support.	1999-10-25a.694.2	The arguments that the Secretary of State has used for means-testing incapacity benefit—the fact that some recipients have big company pensions—would apply equally to retirement pensions, yet the Government think that it is wrong on principle to means-test the national insurance retirement pension. Why is it wrong to means-test the retirement pension, but right to means-test incapacity benefit?	1999-10-25a.694.1	person/10626	person/10153	False	1999-10-25	blair	False	False	0	Work And Pensions	Social Security	Incapacity Benefit	0	liberal-democrat	False	False	labour	True	False
1999-10-25.5.3	I strongly agree with my hon Friend. I confirm that Baroness Hollis, the Under-Secretary of State, made it clear in the other place that the Government, having listened to representations, would exempt from the proposals those who are most severely disabled. That change will be widely welcomed. I accept the arguments in respect of it. The Government will ensure that the appropriate amendments are made to the Bill. As I was saying to the hon Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb), when I took over this job I was struck by how little we were doing for those who are most severely disabled. I do not think that any Labour Government could complete a term of office and simply allow that to continue. I am therefore determined to do more and more to help those who are severely disabled—those who will never, ever work—and I feel very strongly that, as a matter of decency, we owe that to them. I feel equally strongly that the current benefits system is increasingly out of date, and that it will have to keep abreast of changes in society and in the labour market. I therefore believe that the principles underlying our approach are right, but am listening to representations on the detail.	1999-10-25a.695.0	"I welcome the Government's statement in another place that those on the


higher care component of disability living allowance will be exempted from the clawback in incapacity benefit. However, can my right hon Friend assure me that the Government, in modernising welfare, will continue to protect those in greatest need, particularly people who, through the severity of their disability, have never been able to work?"	1999-10-25a.694.3	person/10220	person/10153	False	1999-10-25	blair	False	False	0	Work And Pensions	Social Security	Incapacity Benefit	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
1999-10-25.5.4	We are talking about sums that are drawn down early by someone who has come out of the labour force because of an incapacity. The hon Gentleman said that it was a matter of principle. I was interested in a letter—a copy of which someone was kind enough to send me—sent to all Tory Members by the hon Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles), saying that today's Question Time would be a useful opportunity to see how determined the Government were to reverse the amendments in the other place. The hon Member for Brentwood and Ongar said, however, that a degree of subtlety is required in that the Government is keen to brand the defeats as Tory plotting. The letter goes on to invite Tory Members to a plotting meeting, at 1.15 pm, in the Tea Room. The Tory opposition to the changes that we are proposing in the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill is wholly opportunistic. When people see what the Government have done for disabled people and judge that against what the previous Government did—blocking the changes that we tried to make in establishing the Disability Rights Commission, and at every turn disadvantaging disabled people—most of them will realise that our position is one of principle, in stark contrast to the position taken by Conservative Members.	1999-10-25a.695.2	Does the Secretary of State understand that there is so much cross-party opposition to his proposals not because of points of detail, but because of points of principle, such as the principle of a contributory incapacity benefit? I remind him that it is also a matter of holding him to account for his own statements about encouraging people to save for their own retirement. How can the Government say that they want to encourage people to take out pensions—we heard it again today from the Minister of State, Department of Social Security—but at the same time penalise them if they have an occupational or personal pension—but only if they a pension; the Government are interested in no other type of savings—by depriving them of their incapacity benefit? That is manifestly an attack on saving and is inconsistent with the Government's own statements.	1999-10-25a.695.1	person/10637	person/10153	False	1999-10-25	blair	False	False	2	Work And Pensions	Social Security	Incapacity Benefit	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
1999-10-25.6.0	My hon Friend is right. He asks what our policy is. It is to review the disregards annually as part of the uprating process. They have not been uprated for several years—not since 1988 for income support or since 1996 for the jobseeker's allowance. However, there have been other changes in the welfare benefits system, not least the working families tax credit, which means that it is no longer possible for any family person to claim that they are better off on benefit than in work.	1999-10-25a.697.0	"I welcome my hon Friend to his new position. As he well knows, for many years the previous Government restricted the weekly earning power of those on means-tested benefits to £5 for a single person and £15 for those with families. Through that policy they


ring-fenced the shame and misery of those without work, bringing the fear of fraud to millions of decent families and taxing the energy and enterprise of the poorest in a way that no one has ever suggested should be done to the richest. They made women fearful of looking after their grandchildren and men fearful of mending their mate's car or painting their auntie's house. They restricted self-employment and limited community business. Following the introduction of the minimum wage, the disregard is worth 90 minutes of earning power or four hours for someone with a family. Is it not time that that, too, was modernised?"	1999-10-25a.696.5	person/10137	person/10511	True	1999-10-25	blair	False	False	0	Work And Pensions	Social Security	Earnings Disregards	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

Our document measures the year before our changes came into force and shows the legacy of the previous Government, which will still be rolling along for some time. The hon Gentleman asked for an example. Constituents of mine—and those of most hon Members—who have been claiming family credit and have now gone on to the working families tax credit will be substantially better off under this Government, notwithstanding those—"	1999-10-25a.697.2	"May I associate myself with the words of my hon Friend the Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts) in welcoming the Minister to his post? It is a difficult one and I wish him well. What incentive does the Minister's response give to people on low incomes? The Government have been in power for two and a half years, but their latest ""Households Below Average Income"" document clearly shows that the number of people at the poorer end of the income scale has increased and that the trend is upwards. Will he name a year when poor people will be better off under a Labour Government? Will it be next year or the year after? Will it be 2000, 2001 or 2002? Or is what he has said an example of spin over substance? Does he believe that the Government are tackling poverty merely by saying that they are going to do so?

1999-10-25.7.0	We are aware that people who have money owing because their employer has gone bankrupt are not able to receive benefit. We will therefore propose regulations at the earliest opportunity to remedy that anomaly. In future, jobseeker's allowance and income support will not be refused because of earnings owed to people when their jobs end.	1999-10-25a.698.3	I thank my hon Friend for that announcement. Does she agree that the Tories introduced the present regulations not only as a means of cutting benefits for those made unemployed by their policies, but as one of 30 fiddles to hide the true unemployment rate at the time? Is she aware that people who are made redundant when their firm goes into receivership or liquidation cannot claim this allowance at the moment? Previously, such people were able to claim unemployment benefit, which was recovered from any payment due in lieu.

1999-10-25.8.0	We expect that about 1 million children will gain because of the changes. That contrasts with the fact that, at the moment, some 66 per cent. of children do not see all the benefit to which they are entitled under the present system.	1999-10-25a.698.8	To inform future contributions to the debate, will the Secretary of State tell the House how many parents will have their entitlement to maintenance reduced, and by how much?	1999-10-25a.698.7	person/10062	person/10153	True	1999-10-25	blair	False	False	0	Work And Pensions	Social Security	Child Support Agency	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
1999-10-25.8.1	My hon Friend raises a difficult point which also concerns people whose income can change dramatically because of the availability of overtime. The difficulty is that, at the moment, it takes up to 100 pieces of information to make a basic calculation. Under the new system, we will be able to calculate the sum due in a matter of days, rather than months. That means that where someone's income fluctuates because of the circumstances described by my hon Friend, it will be far easier to make a more accurate assessment of what is due. There is a balance to be struck in terms of what is fair to the parent without care, as well as to the parent with care. However, I am sure that if we simplify the system to ensure that the calculations are made more quickly, we will have a better chance of making sure that we do the right thing by both parents—but above all, by the children concerned.	1999-10-25a.699.0	"I congratulate my right hon Friend on introducing changes to the CSA regulations, and on offering the prospect of greater fairness in the making of maintenance assessments. Will he consider people who are working part time or in seasonal labour? The CSA often takes into consideration


only the income based on periods when such people are in employment. Would not it be much fairer to take into account annual income when assessing maintenance, rather than three or four weeks when such people are in employment? The CSA has applied that principle in some cases, and it is difficult to understand how it can do so in some instances but not in others."	1999-10-25a.698.9	person/10460	person/10153	False	1999-10-25	blair	False	False	0	Work And Pensions	Social Security	Child Support Agency	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
1999-10-25.8.2	In the White Paper, we are considering what greater civil penalties can be imposed where parents will not co-operate. I hope that the hon Gentleman will welcome the fact that the CSA will be given powers, where appropriate, to get to the records held by the Inland Revenue to find out how much someone earns. Many of us have constituents who are not receiving a penny from, usually, the estranged husband, who can be seen driving around town in a BMW and leading a life style that is wholly inconsistent with his assertion that he has no money. I am sorry to say that, as I understand it, the Conservative party is against our proposal.	1999-10-25a.699.2	In the new proposals, what will deal with a parent without care who is self-employed and decides to ignore the CSA? I have constituents who have been waiting two and a half years for any payment, and some people are getting away with blue murder.	1999-10-25a.699.1	person/10368	person/10153	False	1999-10-25	blair	False	False	0	Work And Pensions	Social Security	Child Support Agency	0	plaid-cymru	False	False	labour	True	False
1999-10-25.8.3	"My hon Friend raises two points. One concerns the administration of the Child Support Agency, which we are overhauling. Part of the problem is that its case load has increased dramatically—by about 60 per cent.—in the past couple of years, and that is putting a strain on staff. The agency has a high staff turnover, a problem which we are seeking to tackle, and the complexity of the rules and regulations under which it has to operate leads to difficulties. I regard the situation as wholly unsatisfactory, which is why we are simplifying

the rules and regulations so that instead of 100 pieces of information, three or four will be sufficient to get claims into payment. I agree with my hon Friend's other point, which was that equity demands that people believe that the CSA will pursue anybody who does not pay, and not only those who are more readily accessible. Currently, far too many staff are employed assessing claims and very few enforcing them. I believe that as a result of the changes that we are making far more attention will be given to enforcement, carried out in a fair way."	1999-10-25a.699.4	I welcome my right hon Friend's statement that more will be done to give the CSA power to investigate fathers who are not paying their children's maintenance, but will he ensure that the agency does not tackle only the soft targets: those who are already making a contribution and are being persistently pursued for more? Will he also ensure that bureaucracy is cut back so that my constituents can get a reply to their letters and telephone calls within a reasonable time?	1999-10-25a.699.3	person/10621	person/10153	False	1999-10-25	blair	False	False	0	Work And Pensions	Social Security	Child Support Agency	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
1999-10-25.8.4	I understand the hon Lady's point, but let me repeat that, as a result of the changes that we will make, 1 million more children will get the maintenance to which they are entitled. It is perfectly true that, as a result of the simplified formula, which was published in the White Paper—the ready reckoners are there—some parents will pay more, and some less, but the fundamental point that concerns Labour Members is the fact that those 1 million more children will receive their benefit. I wish that Conservative Members would pay more attention to those children rather than concentrating on those who seek to dodge their responsibility.	1999-10-25a.700.1	Will the Secretary of State answer the question that my hon Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady) asked?

As constituency Members, we have all seen a string of people who have been affected in various ways by the agency's inability to do its job effectively. That is why the move to a much simpler formula for calculating maintenance has been widely welcomed. Changes to child


support regulations are at the centre of our fight against child poverty. It is essential to get maintenance into payment efficiently and effectively."	1999-10-25a.700.5	Have the responses reflected the total muddle, confusion and inefficiency that have dogged thousands of children and families because of the way in which the Child Support Agency was introduced in the previous Parliament? Thousands have been driven into our advice surgeries, desperate for some response from Government. Will my hon Friend assure us that the Government will concentrate on prioritising the needs of children; offering wherever possible a face-to-face consultation as opposed to the thousands of telephone calls that people currently have to make; and, above all, ensuring that there is an efficient and fully prepared set-up to deal with the changes?	1999-10-25a.700.4	person/10309	person/10182	True	1999-10-25	blair	False	False	0	Work And Pensions	Social Security	Child Support Agency	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

Their only concern is the length of time that it will take to bring in the new and simplified procedures.

1999-10-25.10.0	Yes, I can give my hon Friend those assurances. We have learned a great deal from the new deal pilots.

When I visited one of the pilots a few weeks ago in the north of Scotland, I met a man who had been unemployed because of incapacity for 29 years. The new deal had provided him with an opportunity that he had sought for a long time—the opportunity to work. My right hon Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Employment is making available additional resources to pay for supported employment. That will help Remploy and other organisations that are providing supported employment.	1999-10-25a.702.5	I thank the Minister for his reply. May I ask my hon Friend to ensure that any problems that have been highlighted during the pilot scheme are resolved before the scheme goes national? Given the concern about the closure of Remploy factories, will he give me a guarantee that when the new system is up and running, when pilot schemes are extended, and when there are new deals for the disabled throughout the country, there will be better, not fewer, options for the disabled?	1999-10-25a.702.4	person/10625	person/10029	True	1999-10-25	blair	False	False	0	Work And Pensions	Social Security	New Deal (Disabled)	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

wider than that. We have to ensure that work pays by changing the benefit and tax systems that we inherited; and we have to ensure that people who are disabled and seek work get the personal advice and support that they need to obtain employment. We are doing that. We must ensure that barriers to work—some employers are good but others are much poorer—are removed, which we are doing through the disability discrimination legislation. We must advance on all fronts, and we are doing so."	1999-10-25a.703.0	"Will the Minister ensure that he takes more seriously than it has been taken before the research commissioned from the Institute for Employment Studies that suggests an alarming shortfall in future supported employment placements? The figures suggest that there may be a deficiency of between 40,000, on a narrow estimate, and up to 179,000, on a broad estimate, of potential future demand for supported places.

Since South Africa became involved, considerable progress has been achieved on agreeing a transitional Government of all the different factions. That Government are not quite in place, and there is still a lot of destabilisation by forces that support genocide in Burundi and Rwanda. We are getting progress, however, and we are doing everything that we can to drive it forward.
In Zimbabwe, everything that a British Government could have done to try to prevent the ever-growing crisis, abuse of human rights, the stolen election and, now, horrendous levels of hunger, has been done, through the Commonwealth and the European Community, without success. The present situation is catastrophic. We are doing all that we can and are a major player in keeping people fed and cared for. My view is that this catastrophe will bring down the Mugabe regime, but at the cost of terrible suffering for the people of Zimbabwe."	2003-01-22.281.7	I thank my right hon Friend for that reply.

Of course, the regime's delivery of food is deliberately biased and used politically: food is not brought to those villages and places that dared to vote as they wished. But the UN delivery is not politically biased: it is made according to need, but it is faced with all sorts of political problems, and even fuel shortages, which make it a very difficult operation. In addition, HIV levels are so high that people are very weak. For the UN, the key shortage is not enough money in the international system. We have put in a lot, and I have written to Development Ministers across the world about it. There has been some improvement, but we must keep the pipeline full. I am afraid that the recovery will take a long time.	2003-01-22.282.1	The Secretary of State is absolutely right to describe the situation in Zimbabwe as catastrophic.

The new President is a great hope for the country. Unfortunately, he is in hospital because of a deep vein thrombosis, but I gather that the prognosis is good. However, I met his Government, who have inherited a massive hole in public finances, and they have a determination to reform. I have had meetings with the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the EU and others, and we are going to try to mobilise an enormous international effort to help the country forward, deliver to its people and deliver the reform that Kenya needs.	2003-01-22.282.5	President Mwai Kibaki is a man whom I have known and admired for more than 30 years. He is undoubtedly the personality best equipped to grapple with Kenya's very serious problems. I congratulate the Secretary of State on visiting him so soon after his triumphant election.

The Secretary of State has said that the Government are doing all that they can, so I am sure that she will agree that, when innocent Zimbabweans face rape, murder, torture, starvation and ethnic cleansing at the hands of their Government, it would be an insult to their suffering if Robert Mugabe were allowed to visit Paris in February as a guest of the President of France. Can she reassure the House that reports that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office is planning to waive a veto on the granting of a visa to Mugabe are untrue and that her Government will raise at the European Foreign Ministers meeting on Monday the strongest objections to this breach of the sanctions?	2003-01-22.283.0	person/10559	person/10540	False	2003-01-22	blair	False	False	0	International Development	International Development	Sub-Saharan Africa	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2003-01-22.0.5	I agree with my hon Friend that peace in Angola provides great hope for its people and will enable the country's rich resources to be better used. That will help that region of Africa. There has been fighting in Angola since the 1960s, when it began its fight for independence, and there has been civil war ever since. The war is over, but there is desperate hunger and need because of its effects. We support the international mobilisation that is having some success in getting fighters settled and in delivering food to the areas that could not be accessed before. Angola is a fertile country with masses of land and rich diamond and oil resources that have been very badly managed. There is desperate corruption, so there will have to be a big reform effort. However, we are very engaged, as is the international community, and I hope that the Angolan people will be able to look forward to a much better future.	2003-01-22.283.3	One of the most optimistic developments in the whole of sub-Saharan Africa and the whole of Africa last year was the ceasefire in the very long-running war in Angola.

Can she assure me that the Government are doing everything that they possibly can to assist that country in this crucial phase in which it is emerging out of war and in which a whole range of issues needs to be addressed for the development of civil society and the economy and to help those who have spent their whole lives as soldiers to build new hopes, jobs and opportunities?	2003-01-22.283.2	person/10164	person/10540	False	2003-01-22	blair	False	False	0	International Development	International Development	Sub-Saharan Africa	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2003-01-22.0.6	"No, I am afraid that the hon Lady does not understand the HIPC initiative. Twenty-six countries are in receipt of debt relief, but are not paying their debts. Countries reach the point at which they are allowed to stop paying when they put in place a poverty reduction strategy and start a process of reform. Only six have reached the completion rate when the debt is permanently written off, but a much bigger number are receiving debt relief than she suggested. Her 70 per cent. figure is simply wrong.
The HIPC initiative has triggered a major effort for reform in some of the poorest countries, and we can all be proud of that. However, it now needs some adjustment. Partly because of the fall in commodity prices and the great rise in oil prices, there needs to be more generous debt relief to get countries to sustainability. There is another technical problem: the debt relief formula limits what countries can borrow, and Rwanda, Ethiopia and Niger are not being allowed to receive World Bank resources under the initiative. That needs correcting."	2003-01-22.284.1	Many sub-Saharan countries are classified as heavily indebted poor countries and qualify for debt relief. However, only six countries have completed the process of debt relief under the HIPC initiative. That means that 70 per cent. of those countries are failing to meet their targets for receiving debt relief. Of that 70 per cent., three quarters are sub-Saharan countries. Given that the HIPC initiative has missed the target by such a wide margin, will the Secretary of State now agree with Jubilee Research, Oxfam, Christian Aid and many other non-governmental organisations that it is about time that the HIPC initiative was radically overhauled?	2003-01-22.284.0	person/10559	person/10540	False	2003-01-22	blair	False	False	0	International Development	International Development	Sub-Saharan Africa	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2003-01-22.1.0	No, I am sorry, but the hon Gentleman is wrong. I know from his repeated questions on the matter of his continued interest in it, but since he last asked about it, I think, two years ago, the island has decided in a referendum that it wants the airfield. The financing has been agreed and the prospectus, which we expect to be completed around about the end of next month, is being drawn up. I am sure that the hon Gentleman will keep asking questions about the airfield, but steady progress has been made and there is a firm route forward.	2003-01-22.285.0	I am not sure whether that is good news and represents progress. We will have to wait and see what happens. May I remind the Minister that the island's expectations on this issue drag back for several years? Indeed, when a Commonwealth Parliament Association group of which I was a member visited the island in the summer of 1999, the airfield was top of the agenda then. I urge the Minister to get on and to make a decision one way or another because the island has been waiting years. I detect from her answer that the decision on the matter will be prolonged even further.	2003-01-22.284.5	person/10521	person/10328	True	2003-01-22	blair	False	False	0	International Development	International Development	St. Helena	0	liberal-democrat	False	False	labour	True	False

My right hon Friend the Secretary of State has agreed that we will provide £26.3 million, so substantial progress has been made. We look forward to seeing the prospectus and to the project being carried forward.	2003-01-22.285.2	Given the long historical link between the island of St. Helena and the people of south Wales through the coal trade, in particular Barry dock, which was the biggest exporter of coal in the world, and given the lifeline that was provided by the SS St. Helena and the port of Cardiff, will my hon Friend do all she can to ensure that the island gets the airfield it deserves?	2003-01-22.285.1	person/10550	person/10328	False	2003-01-22	blair	False	False	0	International Development	International Development	St. Helena	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2003-01-22.2.0	My hon Friend is sadly right. Some 22.5 per cent. of Palestinian children under five are malnourished and the acute rate in Gaza is 13.2 per cent. That puts Palestinian children in Gaza between Zimbabwe and Congo in terms of children suffering from acute malnutrition. It is a terrible situation. On the middle east and the risks of military action, my Department is working on all the various humanitarian scenarios, the optimistic as well as the pessimistic. The pessimistic are pretty terrible.	2003-01-22.285.7	I am grateful to my right hon Friend for that answer. She told the House last month that the levels of hunger in Gaza were worse than those in Congo.

People cannot get out of their homes to work and are getting ever poorer as the weeks go by. It is a distressing and troubling situation. I have not had discussions with my European counterparts—I do not know whether the hon Lady knows that the European Development Council has been abolished—but discussions are taking place across Europe on whether Israel is complying with the terms of the agreement.	2003-01-22.286.1	Does the Secretary of State agree with those people who say that conditions in the occupied territories are like the aftermath of a terrible natural disaster, such is the destruction and suffering there?

This claim of corruption is a red herring, which is used to try to damn the Palestinian Authority when what we need to do is get on with the development of the two states.

2003-01-22.3.0	I share the hon Gentleman's concern about the campaign for the third term which took place as the crisis was developing. It is not for the UK Government to tell Malawi what to do, but we have said that if such a constitutional change is to be made, surely there should be a full and thorough discussion in which all the people of Malawi are allowed to express their view. Since then, work with the Government of Malawi, the UN institutions and ourselves has gone well, and the present organisation for keeping people fed is good. There is no prospect of behaviour like that witnessed in Zimbabwe, but Malawi is in very bad shape, and reconstruction to the point at which it does not have recurrent crises will take considerable time and requires much more reform.	2003-01-22.287.5	I thank the Secretary of State for that answer. Does she share my concern that President Muluzi's priority seems to be constitutional change to allow him to get a third term in office rather than to address the problem of HIV/AIDS and the food crisis? What can we do to ensure that Malawi does not see the same political interference in aid distribution that we have seen next door in Zimbabwe?	2003-01-22.287.4	person/10785	person/10540	True	2003-01-22	blair	False	False	0	International Development	International Development	Malawi	0	liberal-democrat	False	False	labour	True	False
2003-01-22.3.1	My hon Friend is right that the grain reserve was sold off just before the crisis. It is untrue that that was done under pressure from the IMF—that is a false story. It appears that money was corruptly misplaced, and there are inquiries into that. I agree that charities are doing useful work, but so are the United Nations and the British taxpayer. I hope people understand that charities are at the end of the distribution mechanism. The biggest contribution is from taxpayers, and non-governmental organisations help to deliver at the end of the process. Without taxpayers, we would not get through crises like this. Charitable donations are welcome, but the people of Britain should be proud of what they do through their taxes as well.	2003-01-22.288.0	I am sure that the Secretary of State will join me in welcoming the restoration of much of Malawi's grain reserves, which were sold off by the Government—the root cause of the famine conditions in the country. I am sure that she will join me also in congratulating the many charitable organisations, such as TearFund, which are doing a power of work in Malawi to counter the worst effects of the famine.	2003-01-22.287.6	person/11059	person/10540	False	2003-01-22	blair	False	False	0	International Development	International Development	Malawi	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2003-01-22.3.2	Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It was difficult to hear the question, even on the Front Bench. The hon Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry) was right—the problem concerns not just Malawi, but the whole southern African drought and is complicated by the position in Zimbabwe and Zambia on genetically modified crops. It is deepened by high levels of HIV infection, which has affected one third of the population. People become sick quickly, so they cannot get back to farming and there are more orphans. Recovering from this crisis will be extremely difficult—there has not been one like it before and, with HIV and all the other factors, it will take a long time to recover from it.	2003-01-22.288.3	It is good news that the Government have been able to give so much money for food aid to Malawi. The other aspect of the situation there is the terrible scourge of HIV/AIDS, with 1 million orphans already. Does the Secretary of State agree that the international community must make a qualitative response to the huge number of AIDS orphans in Africa? Countries such as Malawi simply do not have the sustainable capacity to respond to the needs of their own orphans— [Interruption.]	2003-01-22.288.1	person/10023	person/10540	False	2003-01-22	blair	False	False	0	International Development	International Development	Malawi	1	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2003-01-22.4.0	I do not fully agree with my hon Friend or Christian Aid, if that is what it is saying. In Afghanistan, 5 million people are dependent on food aid, as there has been a fifth year of drought in the south. The refugees need continuing support, but so too does a large part of the Afghan population. The biggest problems are achieving stability outside Kabul so that the economy can start running again and dealing with the drought. The World Food Programme needs more money than has been needed for many years. The UNHCR also needs some more resources, but it is slightly overstating its claimed shortage.	2003-01-22.289.3	Is my right hon Friend aware of the concerns— [Interruption.]	2003-01-22.289.0	person/10564	person/10540	True	2003-01-22	blair	False	False	0	International Development	International Development	Afghan Refugees	1	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2003-01-22.4.1	I agree with my hon Friend. When the Taliban were overthrown, they were providing arms and money to warlords, who are now strong, so getting stability throughout the country is difficult. There are plans for regional security teams in the big cities, but it would have been desirable if that step had been taken earlier. This is the crunch for Afghanistan—if we cannot get order and security, we will not get economic development and people who are still desperately poor will not have a better future.	2003-01-22.289.5	As my right hon Friend knows, the Select Committee on International Development is publishing its report on the reconstruction of Afghanistan on Thursday.

However, I return to a point that I have made before and to which President Bush alluded yesterday. We cannot go back to the situation that existed in the 1990s, when the inspectors were in Iraq for years and Saddam was effectively concealing what he was doing. Saddam's duty is to co-operate fully with the inspections regime, which is not a detective agency: it is supposed to be given the full details of what is in Iraq's programme and then be able to inspect and close the programme down. The duty to co-operate is not only about access to sites, but about being open and honest.

I understand entirely why he and his constituents will be angry about a decision that affects their livelihood, but he will know two other things. First, the original European Union proposals were changed very significantly from an 80 per cent. reduction down to 45 per cent. Secondly, there is no way in which we can responsibly say that this is not a serious issue to do with the level of fishing stocks. Where jobs are lost, however—this is why I say to the hon Gentleman that we will provide the necessary assistance for people—we must ensure that people are given the proper protection and ability to find new jobs.	2003-01-22.296.4	Yesterday, the Malakoff and Moore boatyard in Shetland announced that it would be going into receivership, threatening almost 200 jobs in my constituency—just the first casualties of last month's disgraceful Fisheries Council. When the Prime Minister meets fishing leaders next week, will he be able to offer fishing-dependent communities such as Shetland new money from the Treasury, or will it just be tea and sympathy?	2003-01-22.296.3	person/10785	person/10047	False	2003-01-22	blair	True	False	0	Prime Minister	Prime Minister	Engagements	0	liberal-democrat	False	False	labour	True	False
2003-01-22.6.13	Despite the reaction of Opposition Members, the point that my hon Friend makes is serious and right, which is precisely why the Criminal Justice Bill, which will offer witnesses better protection, and the antisocial behaviour orders that we propose in the antisocial behaviour Bill will make a difference. As a result of the introduction of the measures that we discussed earlier, we have more police on the beat and we are looking to see how we get more police, particularly in relation to transport in London.	2003-01-22.297.0	May I draw my right hon Friend's attention to concerns about the rising number of attacks on bus drivers in London? A bus service was withdrawn for 10 days from an estate in my constituency following the stabbing of a driver in the hand. Children are committing these crimes. I call on my right hon Friend to join me in asking parents to exert more control over their children, particularly when they are out in the community. [Interruption.] Moreover, does my right hon Friend accept that too many people who are involved in these crimes are getting away with them by intimidating and threatening witnesses? Does he accept that the police and local authorities need more powers to deal with such individuals, particularly the minority of parents who will not take any action to protect the community from the activities of their children?	2003-01-22.296.5	person/10185	person/10047	False	2003-01-22	blair	True	False	0	Prime Minister	Prime Minister	Engagements	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2003-01-22.6.14	On the latter point, it surely must be the case that local health trusts could purchase places in the private sector since they are able to do so, but I do not know enough about the facts of the hon Gentleman's individual case. He makes a fair point about the hospice movement. Obviously, there is a limit on the amount of public resources and public investment that we can put in, but I am aware, from representations that I have received myself, not just of the good work that hospices do but of the role that they can play in giving palliative care, and it is something that we are looking at. I simply tell the hon Gentleman that there will be a limit to the amount of money that we can put in.	2003-01-22.297.2	Will the Prime Minister undertake to look again at funding for the hospice movement in the United Kingdom? Although the Government have said that they are committed to providing greater palliative care for all who need it, the reality is that statutory funding for adult hospices in the UK has declined from 33 per cent. to 28 per cent. of their needs in the last five years, and in my local hospice in the Weald it is only 10 per cent., with the absurd result that, while the local hospital is absolutely full, there are empty beds in the hospice, where, arguably, better quality care can be provided, and definitely at a much lower cost to the taxpayer.	2003-01-22.297.1	person/10457	person/10047	False	2003-01-22	blair	True	False	0	Prime Minister	Prime Minister	Engagements	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False

As for Iraq, we will spend what is necessary to ensure that the threat to the security of the world posed by weapons of mass destruction is dealt with. We have set out a process for doing that, but if we do not deal with the threat of Saddam Hussein, if we allow him to develop weapons of mass destruction and if, as he has done many times before, he threatens his own neighbours, do we not think that we will also be sucked into a conflict, but a far worse and more expensive one this time?"	2003-01-22.297.4	Will the Prime Minister tell the House and the country how much the build-up to the war in Iraq is costing the British taxpayer?

The turnaround for checking has been speeded up dramatically, but it is important for those transporting children with special educational needs in particulr, to be subject to the right checks.
I know that my hon Friend is meeting people in the near future to discuss the problem. It is important for us to ensure that the checks are carried out, and carried out as quickly as possible, so that transport for those children can be provided."	2003-01-22.298.3	My right hon Friend knows of the case of my constituent Mary Powell, who, like many parents of children with special educational needs throughout the country, faces serious difficulties in arranging safe transport between home and school for her child. He will share my concern about evidence that has come to light in Merton and elsewhere that when minicabs are involved, neither the drivers nor the escorts who go with the children are being properly vetted by the police. Will he continue to do all he can to strengthen and enforce child protection regulations, so that we have mechanisms to root out poor practice wherever we find it?	2003-01-22.298.2	person/10094	person/10047	False	2003-01-22	blair	True	False	0	Prime Minister	Prime Minister	Engagements	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2003-01-22.6.18	I do not accept what the right hon Gentleman says. I would also point out that it is not just the measures on benefit that are making a difference now; it is also the withdrawal of exceptional leave to remain, it is also the juxtaposed controls, and it is also the fact that 70 per cent. of asylum claims are now decided within two months. When we took office—particularly as the right hon Gentleman's party was prepared to cut the number of immigration officers—claims were taking 12 months to decide. All those things are making a difference.	2003-01-22.298.5	I welcome the Prime Minister's decision to reinstate the measures that I introduced to remove the right to benefits from those who enter this country as business men, tourists or students, but subsequently claim asylum. Does he acknowledge that his mistake in endorsing the removal of the changes I made and the reinstatement of those benefits five years ago contributed to a doubling of the number of asylum seekers? Will he tell us how many extra economic migrants the country has had to admit and pay for as a result of five mistaken years?	2003-01-22.298.4	person/10362	person/10047	False	2003-01-22	blair	True	False	0	Prime Minister	Prime Minister	Engagements	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False

2003-01-22.6.20	It has increased, for reasons that are clear, not just in this country but in other countries. In certain areas of the country, there is a culture of gun crime that must be suppressed. Let me point out two things to the hon Gentleman. First, overall, crime is down, not up, under this Government, whereas it doubled under the Conservatives. Secondly, I hope that when we introduce measures to impose a mandatory five-year sentence for the illegal possession of a firearm, Conservatives will accept and support them, contrary to the position that they have adopted so far; otherwise, there is no use the hon Gentleman's saying that there is a problem, but refusing to accept the solution to deal with it.	2003-01-22.299.3	Can the Prime Minister say why gun crime has increased by 90 per cent. since he took office?	2003-01-22.299.2	person/10964	person/10047	False	2003-01-22	blair	True	False	0	Prime Minister	Prime Minister	Engagements	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2003-01-22.6.21	I have to say to my hon Friend that it is not just a question of the inspectors finding the weapons; it is a question of the duty of co-operation: Saddam has to make sure that any weapons that he has are honestly exposed and shut down by the weapons inspectors. That is how the weapons inspection regime is supposed to work. If the inspectors find the facts in respect of a breach of resolution 1441, it goes back before the Security Council, which should then take the necessary measures. But it is not just about finding the weapons; it is also about making sure that there is full co-operation with the inspections regime.	2003-01-22.300.1	If the weapons inspectors find no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and want more time to look, and if my right hon Friend is agreeable to giving more time but President Bush is not, who will make the final decision?

1986-05-01.0.0	That was an interesting question, and one that I had not expected. Last July, when there was a debate on the De Lorean affair, we said that the Government would do all that they could to bring De Lorean to trial if he ever touched down in the country. I take note of what the hon Gentlman says, and undoubtedly other Ministers and Members will have heard it as well.	1986-05-01a.1078.4	Was not John De Lorean responsible for making many people unemployed in Northern Ireland? Will the Minister take steps to ensure that that individual is extradited to this country and placed on trial?

Last year Shorts brought out the Tucano plane, recently there were sales of aircraft to British Midland Airways Ltd., and the contract for the auxiliary oiler replenishment vessel went to Harland and Wolff last week. We trust that other firms in Northern Ireland, with the same enterprise and backing of the work force, will gain such contracts here, in Northern Ireland, and throughout the world.	1986-05-01a.1078.6	Would not unemployment be assisted far more greatly in Northern Ireland if the example set by companies such as Shorts, and Harland and Wolff, which do so much to provide jobs for people in the Province and exports to the world, were emulated by others in the Province?	1986-05-01a.1078.5	person/19736	person/16760	False	1986-05-01	thatcher	False	False	0	Northern Ireland	Northern Ireland	Unemployment	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

I take totally what the right hon Gentleman has said.	1986-05-01a.1078.8	Let us see whether the Minister expects this question. In considering the factors that are likely to have a favourable effect on employment in the Province, will the Government not overlook the importance of transport action between the Province and the mainland, particularly the urgency of ensuring that use is made of the roll-on/roll-off facilities for transport in the port of Warrenpoint?	1986-05-01a.1078.7	<UNKNOWN>	person/16760	True	1986-05-01	thatcher	False	False	0	Northern Ireland	Northern Ireland	Unemployment	0				<UNKNOWN>	False	False

There has also been an increase of imports into the United Kingdom market.	1986-05-01a.1079.3	On that point, does my hon Friend agree that that makes so important the representations that we made to the Treasury about the level of tobacco taxation, because we foresaw what eventually could occur as a result of the increase in tobacco duty?	1986-05-01a.1079.2	person/22577	person/16760	False	1986-05-01	thatcher	False	False	0	Northern Ireland	Northern Ireland	Unemployment	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1986-05-01.0.5	There is no doubt that the hon Gentleman's point is highly relevant to employment, and even more so to unemployment in Northern Ireland.

The best thing that could be done for industrial advancement in Northern Ireland would be to achieve a political settlement, especially in relation to the hon Gentleman's point, so that people can come to the Province knowing that there will be continuity of production.	1986-05-01a.1079.5	Can the Minister give any assessment of the damage that has been done to employment prospects for the people of the north of Ireland by the recent form of Fascism centering on a new approach—a Bible in one hand and a petrol bomb in the other?	1986-05-01a.1079.4	person/10411	person/16760	False	1986-05-01	thatcher	False	False	0	Northern Ireland	Northern Ireland	Unemployment	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

1986-05-01.5.0	In view of the position in which the two major Unionist parties find themselves, the first objective is to see whether it is possible for such a framework to be established. Obviously, thereafter, it becomes a question of the involvement of other parties in possible further discussions.	1986-05-01a.1083.9	I welcome the Secretary of State's answer. Does he not think that, given the willingness of the SDLP and the alliance party of Northern Ireland to enter into discussions without pre-conditions, the time has come to fix a date for those talks to begin?	1986-05-01a.1083.8	person/16469	person/10342	True	1986-05-01	thatcher	False	False	0	Northern Ireland	Northern Ireland	Political Parties (Talks)	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

1986-05-01.6.1	I appreciate the hon Gentleman's concern about coal sales from Ayrshire to Northern Ireland. The conversion of Kilroot from oil to coal burning is going ahead. The contract has been given to the NEI. We shall have to weigh the question of conversion at other power stations. Much depends upon the price at which coal can be bought. Electricity prices in Northern Ireland have continually been among the highest in the United Kingdom. As the price of oil is falling, and if coal is to be bought for Northern Ireland, we shall have to consider the price at which it can be bought from the Coal Board.	1986-05-01a.1084.1	Will the Minister tell the House what effect the development of lignite will have on the supply of Ayrshire coal to power stations in Northern Ireland? In particular, will he confirm that it is planned that the Kilroot power station will continue to burn Ayrshire coal? Will he also tell us why the decision has been made in the short term to burn oil at the Belfast West power station—a very unwise decision—when the supply of Ayrshire coal can be maintained and guaranteed in the long term? Will the Northern Ireland Office hold discussions with the Coal Board about the use of Ayrshire coal in Northern Ireland and the devastating effect it would have on Ayrshire if the supply of coal to Northern Ireland were not continued?	1986-05-01a.1084.0	person/10211	person/16760	False	1986-05-01	thatcher	False	False	0	Northern Ireland	Northern Ireland	Lignite	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1986-05-01.6.2	This is one of those times when I can answer yes. I agree entirely with the hon Member for Foyle (Mr. Hume). We have granted a prospecting only licence for two years. There is no guarantee that a mining licence will follow. I have met objectors from East Tyrone in my office in Northern Ireland and I have read all the material that they have published. We have given a straightforward commitment—which has the agreement of my hon Friend the Minister with responsibility for the environment in Northern Ireland—that if a mining application is made by any company, a public inquiry will be held.	1986-05-01a.1084.3	Is the Minister aware of the public concern that has been expressed by many residents in the Lough Neagh area about the possibility of damage being done to the environment by lignite mining? As the environmental quality of that area is the highest in Europe, does he not think that a public inquiry is necessary before a licence to mine lignite in the Lough Neagh area is granted?	1986-05-01a.1084.2	person/10300	person/16760	False	1986-05-01	thatcher	False	False	0	Northern Ireland	Northern Ireland	Lignite	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

Neagh. If prospecting had been a threat to the level of Lock Neagh, or to its boundaries, we should have had to think very deeply before granting the licences."	1986-05-01a.1084.5	Does the hon Gentleman appreciate that the danger envisaged by the hon Member for Foyle (Mr. Hume) applies to the prospecting itself? As Lough Neagh is listed in the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands as a site of international importance, have the Government given notice of their proposal to grant licences for prospecting, and have they made any assessment of its effect upon wildlife?	1986-05-01a.1084.4	person/16494	person/16760	False	1986-05-01	thatcher	False	False	0	Northern Ireland	Northern Ireland	Lignite	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

Will my right hon Friend accept that it is no answer to say that we should not interfere in the internal affairs of the Republic?	1986-05-01a.1085.6	Since I last answered questions in the House on 27 March, two civilians and two members of the security forces have died in incidents arising from the security situation in the Province. The efforts of the security forces are continuing to yield results. Since the beginning of the year, a total of 264 people have been charged with serious offences and 95 weapons, 10,500 rounds of ammunition and 2,460 lb of explosives have been recovered. The House will wish to note that seven of these weapons and 1,240 lb of explosives have been recovered in the last six days.	1986-05-01a.1085.3	<UNKNOWN>	person/18825	False	1986-05-01	thatcher	False	False	1	Northern Ireland	Northern Ireland	Security	1				<UNKNOWN>	False	False

If that is made clear, perhaps the time will come when the Unionist Members of Parliament will return to their seats here.	1986-05-01a.1087.2	asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if he will make a statement about progress in implementing the provisions of the Anglo-Irish agreement.	1986-05-01a.1086.8	person/22346	person/10645	False	1986-05-01	thatcher	False	False	0	Northern Ireland	Northern Ireland	Anglo-Irish Agreement	3	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False
1986-05-01.9.0	I shall certainly not support any legislation which takes away from the security forces in Northern Ireland a means of protection against the sustained and vicious rioting which they have had to endure over the period of these troubles. It may also be worth mentioning that the European Court of Human Rights has found that the use of baton rounds in Northern Ireland constitutes reasonable force.	1986-05-01a.1089.0	"Bearing in mind that most of the victims were children or young people, many of them innocent bystanders, who were killed, blinded, paralysed or suffered brain damage, and now especially since the tragic death of Keith White, the use of such lethal weapons has been rightly condemned by many people of the Unionist tradition as well as people of the Republican

1986-05-01.9.1	The short answer to my hon Friend's question is that I know of no other means of protecting the security forces against rioting that would be as effective. Water cannon and CS gas have both proved to be ineffective. I know of no alternative to baton rounds at present.	1986-05-01a.1089.2	Can my hon Friend say what other form of defence would be available to the security forces if baton rounds were eliminated?	1986-05-01a.1089.1	person/18416	person/22052	False	1986-05-01	thatcher	False	False	0	Northern Ireland	Northern Ireland	Plastic And Rubber Bullets	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

I think that it is up to those who complain about the use of baton rounds and who wish to have them removed to come forward with an alternative that would be as good and as effective in protecting the security forces against rioting.	1986-05-01a.1089.4	My question No. 27 on the Order Paper is similar to that of my hon Friend the Member for Falkirk, West (Mr. Canavan).

I should like to thank the governors who stood at their posts, the police officers who also stood at their posts, and the police, who backed up the whole service.	1986-05-01a.1091.2	Now that the prison officers have suspended their industrial action, thereby giving further evidence of their good will and sense of responsibility, why are the Government adding stubbornness to their original folly by refusing to engage in talks with them?	1986-05-01a.1091.1	person/13171	person/19284	False	1986-05-01	thatcher	True	False	4	Prime Minister	Prime Minister	Engagements	0	<UNKNOWN>	False	False	<UNKNOWN>	False	False

For some time many of us have felt that it is time we had a new GATT round so that we can jointly get rid of or reduce some of the barriers. This is meeting with a good deal of hostility in some quarters, but we shall nevertheless continue to persevere with that line, both at the Tokyo summit and beyond.	1986-05-01a.1092.6	Is my right hon Friend aware that we are proud of the fact that she will be this country's representative at the Tokyo summit?

2003-05-15.0.0	"I know that my hon Friend has been very active on behalf of his local company and his constituents in respect of this issue. I can reassure him that there are strict controls and regulations on imports from countries such as Brazil. They must come from a slaughterhouse that meets the EU standard, and they must go through border inspection posts, at which there is 100 per cent. inspection of documentation and 50 per cent. physical inspection of the product.
I understand my hon Friend's point about the use of illegal vaccinations. Tests are being carried out on poultry meat to ensure that such products are not receiving vaccinations that are banned in the EU. We are taking seriously the concerns that have been expressed, and we are currently carrying out a full investigation with the support of Customs and Excise."	2003-05-15.441.10	I welcome the brief answer that the Minister has given. My concern relates to the use of nitrofurans as antibiotics in turkey meat from Brazil, and the mis-description of imports into this country from Brazil, where products that appear to be marginally treated are dealt with in a different tariff fashion. This has had a major impact on Brandon's Poultry in Scropton, in my constituency.

Illegal imports is one of them and we take it seriously, which is why more finance has been provided, Customs and Excise has been given a stronger role, we have improved the range of publicity and information for people entering this country, and we have obtained agreement from the EU to end the derogations that allowed the importation of personal meat products.	2003-05-15.442.1	"I share the concern of the hon Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd) about nitrofurans in meat, and the Minister is aware of my concern about illegal meat imports generally, including turkey meat.

It is desirable to support the wider rural economy as well as agri-environment measures.	2003-05-15.443.2	I hope that my right hon Friend will bear it in mind in the negotiations that many of us do not want the current system, through which farmers are subsidised for production, to be replaced by one which subsidises them simply because they own a piece of farmland or—even worse—because they once happened to be farmer. I know that she has been pushing hard for fundamental reform at European level, but I hope that she will bear in mind those concerns and press for as much funding as possible to be transferred to true rural development, rather than continuing with the current subsidy culture in another form.	2003-05-15.443.1	person/11038	person/10031	False	2003-05-15	blair	False	False	0	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Common Agricultural Policy	0	labourco-operative	False	False	labour	True	False
2003-05-15.1.2	I can certainly assure the right hon Gentleman that the Government are very conscious of some of the serious and genuine practical problems that existing proposals raise. I cannot give the right hon Gentleman the answer that he seeks at present, but we believe that the talks and negotiations remain on course for basic decisions by the end of June. Once we see the shape of those decisions, we will know what impact they will have. However, I assure the right hon Gentleman that we have received many representations about the points that he makes, and that we take them very seriously.	2003-05-15.443.4	Does the Secretary of State accept that there is an urgent need to establish what happens to the right of entitlement to the single farm payment in cases where the land has changed hands or tenancy during the reference period? If the decision is to devolve the matter to member states, will she ensure that the Government's intentions are clarified as soon as possible, and that a detailed consultation is held?	2003-05-15.443.3	person/10149	person/10031	False	2003-05-15	blair	False	False	0	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Common Agricultural Policy	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2003-05-15.1.3	My hon Friend is entirely right that the Curry commission proposals go further than the generality of the mid-term review reform proposals would suggest. That lends a particular importance and urgency to our efforts to have that position recognised and taken account of in the negotiations. I assure both my hon Friend and the House that there is nothing that the Government want less than to abandon the steps that we have already taken or the plans that the Curry commission rightly put forward for further steps in the UK.	2003-05-15.444.0	The mid-term review proposals to decouple payments do not sit easily with the Curry commission's recommendations on modulation—10 per cent., and then 20 per cent. Is my right hon Friend confident that, in the light of that, the broad and shallow entry scheme can be funded?	2003-05-15.443.5	person/10597	person/10031	False	2003-05-15	blair	False	False	0	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Common Agricultural Policy	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2003-05-15.1.4	I shall answer the hon Gentleman's final point first. He will know that there is already broad agreement about the nature of the financial framework for the future use and structure of the CAP. I share his view entirely that much of the language is impenetrable, but the numbers at least are not. In addition, we have been, and will continue to be, engaged in extensive talks, bilaterally and in small groups, with other member states and the Commission. The course of action that the Commission is pursuing is that the proposals put into the public domain by Commissioner Fischler remain on the table. It is engaged in extensive dialogue with individual member states about the concerns raised by the proposals. We anticipate that there will be further extensive discussions at the next Agriculture Council, which I think is to be held next week. However, the proposals that remain on the table are the proposals with which the House and the farming community are familiar.	2003-05-15.444.2	Although much of the language is impenetrable to members of the public, the Secretary of State is aware that momentous decisions need to be made very shortly. What will she do to secure a deal and face down the German and French pack to protect the viability of small family farms, ensure that the nation state is able to distribute the top-sliced modulated rural development funds and, above all, significantly reduce the overall common agricultural policy budget?	2003-05-15.444.1	person/10222	person/10031	False	2003-05-15	blair	False	False	0	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Common Agricultural Policy	0	liberal-democrat	False	False	labour	True	False
2003-05-15.1.5	My hon Friend raises another serious and valid point, which has been raised with this Government, with the Governments of many other member states, and with the Commission. I can assure him that we are mindful of the danger. We do not believe that it is as serious as some of those engaged in the sector believe, but we accept that we have to examine the position and take it into account as the final proposals begin to emerge.	2003-05-15.444.4	What estimates has my right hon Friend made of the effect of CAP reform on the sectors that are currently unsupported, such as fruit and vegetables? Is there not a danger that some farmers will take single-farm payments, move into those sectors with a competitive advantage, and distort markets that are currently very finely balanced?	2003-05-15.444.3	person/10248	person/10031	False	2003-05-15	blair	False	False	0	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Common Agricultural Policy	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2003-05-15.1.6	As the hon Gentleman will know from what I said to my hon Friend the Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping) a few moments ago, we are mindful indeed of the fact that our voluntary modulation—some other member states are also pursuing one—goes further than the Commission's initial proposals. We are discussing with the Commission how best to handle that in terms of the transitional scheme, which is particularly relevant to the United Kingdom.	2003-05-15.445.0	Does the right hon Lady believe that a national scheme for modulation is necessary, in addition to the European modulation scheme proposed by the Commission?	2003-05-15.444.5	person/10361	person/10031	False	2003-05-15	blair	False	False	2	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Common Agricultural Policy	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2003-05-15.2.0	My hon Friend makes a good point. There is now greater sensitivity towards pollutants and a greater understanding of their impact. We do not believe that the battle is yet won: pointing to indicators of progress does not mean that we are satisfied with the position that we have reached. Although the emissions of most pollutants are falling, concentration levels of some are not falling as fast as we would like. I can reassure my hon Friend that we shall remain focused on the targets and work with our colleagues in the Department of Health to remain fully sensitive to the points that he makes.	2003-05-15.446.0	I thank the Minister for his answer and I commend the Government for the work that they have done. However, conditions such as asthma are greatly exacerbated by pollution. Pollution may not cause it, but, as I know from my experience, it certainly makes it worse. The number of asthma sufferers now totals 5 million. Has the Minister examined the research on the effects of long-term air pollution carried out by the air pollution unit of the Department of Health? When will the measures that he has announced have a significant effect on air pollution, so that conditions such as asthma can be significantly ameliorated?	2003-05-15.445.6	person/10684	person/10431	True	2003-05-15	blair	False	False	0	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	National Air Quality Targets	0	labour	True	False	labourco-operative	False	False
2003-05-15.2.1	The hon Gentleman addresses transport policy and tax in his question, which confirms the important fact that many Departments make a contribution to these policy issues. We are conscious of the impact of air transport and the situation around airports, which is clear from our statement on the consultation documents on the future of air transport in the south-east.	2003-05-15.446.2	Does the Minister accept that the good work done in tackling air pollution will be undermined if the airline industry is not brought under control? Is he aware that Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports alone emit more than 2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide and 13,000 tonnes of nitrogen dioxide each year? The industry's CO2 emissions are set to double between 1990 and 2010. Will his Department support the imposition of a European Union aviation fuel tax, and also tell the Department for Transport that it must resist the discredited predict-and-provide policy for more runways in the south-east?	2003-05-15.446.1	person/10022	person/10431	False	2003-05-15	blair	False	False	0	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	National Air Quality Targets	0	liberal-democrat	False	False	labourco-operative	False	False
2003-05-15.2.2	My hon Friend makes a very good point. Ozone levels in rural areas are a problem, and we are not satisfied with the progress that has been made. It should be remembered that ozone is a highly trans-boundary pollutant and we are taking measures nationally to control ozone precursors, such as nitrogen dioxide and volatile organic compounds. Internationally agreed measures are the most effective ways to tackle that pollutant, as ground-level ozone concentrations in southern England are influenced largely by trans-boundary pollution. The UK will play a key role in seeking agreements on those issues, and my hon Friend is right to highlight them as an area for concern.	2003-05-15.446.4	Does my right hon Friend accept that air pollution is not simply an urban problem? It has a worrying effect in rural areas, especially given the amount of ozone from motorways. Is it right to put special effort into monitoring that, and does he agree that that should be part of a properly constituted overall policy, instead of one that just concentrates on urban areas?	2003-05-15.446.3	person/10177	person/10431	False	2003-05-15	blair	False	False	0	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	National Air Quality Targets	0	labourco-operative	False	False	labourco-operative	False	False
2003-05-15.2.3	The hon Gentleman is right to suggest that air pollution problems arise in areas such as market towns, where one would not expect them, and he has raised the issue in the House in the past. I can assure him that air quality issues are considered across government by this Department and our colleagues in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Department for Transport.	2003-05-15.447.0	Surprisingly, many local air quality management areas exist in small market towns, and some of those are set to deteriorate further as a result of unsympathetic planning.

2003-05-15.3.0	We are mindful of the importance of the Bonn conference and we shall certainly be represented at a senior level. Unfortunately, we have not had much notice of those dates and Ministers' diaries are under considerable pressure. We are trying to find out who might be able to attend, but I cannot tell my hon Friend at this point. I can tell her that we are involved in the renewable energy and energy efficiency partnership. We are taking that forward with great vigour and there is great interest in it from many companies and organisations across the world. We hope that it will be a fruitful vehicle. We are also working with other states that are pursuing similar partnerships internationally. I can assure my hon Friend that the coalition of people who wish to pursue the advance of renewable energy is alive and well.	2003-05-15.447.5	Given the lack of binding targets on renewable energy set at Johannesburg and the fact that the follow-up on energy will not begin until 2006, what strategies are the Government developing on expanding the use of renewable energy globally, and will a British Minister attend the Bonn conference on that subject next month?	2003-05-15.447.4	person/10519	person/10031	True	2003-05-15	blair	False	False	0	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Sustainable Development	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2003-05-15.3.1	We have had many discussions with our Treasury colleagues and I can, in all honesty, tell the right hon Gentleman that there is no unwillingness in the Treasury team to look at those issues. There have already been, and there will continue to be, extensive discussions. The industry is very aware of the position: so far, it has not been able to make its case with sufficient force to convince the Treasury about the further steps that would make the dramatic difference that has been suggested. Treasury Ministers are open to those discussions—	2003-05-15.448.0	On the issue of sustainable development and road fuels, the Secretary of State will be aware of the contribution that is being made by the development of biodiesel, especially from the use of oilseed rape as a feedstock. However, the 20p duty derogation is not considered sufficient to pump-prime the industry in the UK. What representations could her Department make, even at this late stage in the passage of the Finance Bill, to try to increase the derogation from 20p to 28p, thus triggering an important development in sustainability?	2003-05-15.447.6	person/10307	person/10031	False	2003-05-15	blair	False	False	0	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Sustainable Development	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2003-05-15.3.2	We are talking about substantial sums of money.

2003-05-15.3.3	I share my hon Friend's view that it is a good way of improving the understanding of sustainable development. DEFRA and the Department for Education and Skills make substantial information available to schools. Offhand, I am not aware whether special information is devoted to the network of eco-schools, but I shall certainly draw my hon Friend's remarks to the attention of the relevant staff.	2003-05-15.448.4	My right hon Friend will know that there is a growing network of eco-schools, where children of all ages learn about sustainable development in practical ways. That is a good way of embedding in future generations knowledge of, and responsibility for, sustainable development. Can my right hon Friend tell us whether the Department already disseminates information on sustainable development to the network of eco-schools? If not, does she not think that it is a really good idea and is a way of improving people's understanding of sustainable development?	2003-05-15.448.3	person/10338	person/10031	False	2003-05-15	blair	False	False	0	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Sustainable Development	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2003-05-15.4.0	I know of my hon Friend's interest in this matter. Indeed, he took me to Walthamstow reservoir to see the problem. Unfortunately, on that particular morning there was a thick fog so I can only say that I could see no problem. However, I know that there is a problem and that my hon Friend is serious about it. As he knows, we have spent a great deal of money on looking into ways of dealing with the matter; for example, research is currently under way on fish refuges, which may be helpful in dealing with the problem. My hon Friend will also know that in the worst-case scenario we can issue licences for control, but people have to demonstrate an economic loss and that other ways of deterring cormorants have been tried and have failed. We are willing to work with the angling world to find out how we can deter cormorants from eating its fish.	2003-05-15.449.1	Does the Minister agree that it will come as no surprise to either anglers or the taxpayers who funded the research to learn that cormorants eat fish? The point is what will the Minister do to make it easier for fishery owners and angling clubs to protect their stocks and their livelihoods, especially in the light of the news this week that at Walthamstow reservoir, fish stocks worth £50,000 were predated in a single year?	2003-05-15.449.0	person/10526	person/10444	True	2003-05-15	blair	False	False	0	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Cormorants (Inland Fisheries)	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2003-05-15.4.1	I understand the hon Gentleman's point. Of course there is an issue regarding still-water fisheries and the trend towards inland cormorant breeding, but his suggested solution may not work, and non-lethal deterrents may be equally effective. We do take the problem seriously; we must identify the most effective way of deterring such predation, and to do so we must examine the whole range of options.	2003-05-15.449.3	"May I declare an interest? I have a pond on my farm in County Antrim— [Interruption.] —I will invite the Minister there.
At this time of year, I go to Movanagher fish farm to buy brown trout to stock the pond. All year round, I never see a cormorant, but within 24 hours cormorants come in and eat every one of those trout— [Interruption.] This is a serious point. At Movanagher fish farm, at fish farms throughout the United Kingdom and in commercial and sporting fishing, it is a disaster. The only way to deal with the problem is not to waste money on civil servants but to designate a number of days when cormorant stocks throughout the UK can be culled."	2003-05-15.449.2	person/10768	person/10444	False	2003-05-15	blair	False	False	0	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Cormorants (Inland Fisheries)	0	uup	False	False	labour	True	False
2003-05-15.5.0	I understand the hon Gentleman's concern because he referred to the closure of an abattoir in his constituency. I understand that the decision to close that abattoir was a commercial one, not attributable directly to the introduction of the animal by-products regulations, although they may be a factor.	2003-05-15.450.4	I am grateful to the right hon Gentleman for that answer, which I think shows the dramatic reduction in the number of abattoirs in England and the United Kingdom as a whole. Will he share my concern that the last abattoir in my constituency, the family firm JJJ Heathcote & Son, which has been in operation for six generations, has closed because of the huge additional costs imposed upon abbatoirs by the animal by-products regulations—particularly those relating to biological testing and the disposal of blood, which will add costs to the company, which went out of active trading on 1 May , of £525 a week? The Minister can see that that is a huge additional sum. What is the Minister going to do to safeguard animal welfare and reduce the inconvenience and costs to farmers, by ensuring that in future small abattoirs remain in business?	2003-05-15.450.3	person/10647	person/10431	True	2003-05-15	blair	False	False	2	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Abattoirs	0	conservative	False	True	labourco-operative	False	False
2003-05-15.5.1	My hon Friend makes a good point about the need to ensure the availability of abattoir capacity in order to help local and regional products, and we are doing so in conjunction with the Government offices and the regional development agencies. However, one has to remember that we are talking about commercial activities, and the Meat and Livestock Commission has estimated that in 1999, comparing peak-week activity with average activity, the overcapacity amounted to 49 per cent. for cattle, 55 per cent. for sheep and 27 per cent. for pigs. I came across problems in the abattoir industry when I was first elected to a local authority in 1973, so many of these issues are not new. We should bear in mind, in trying to assist local and regional provision of facilities, that these are commercial activities and that there is still an element of over-provision.	2003-05-15.450.8	Should not we be doing more not only to protect existing abattoirs but to encourage the re-establishment of local abattoirs? Will not that minimise stress to animals, reduce the risk and scale of any disease outbreaks and—as important as anything—encourage the availability of locally produced meat, which many consumers say that they are looking for and would support?

2003-05-15.5.3	Our response has to be proportionate because, on the one hand, yes, testing places burdens on industry, but many of those tests are either national or international requirements and, on the other, people want food safety to be enhanced, and they will find that encouraging. Wherever possible, we have to ensure that the burdens that we impose are proportionate and reasonable, that they are not excessive and that we do not go in for gold plating, but I am sure that the hon Gentleman would accept that food safety is of great importance. The Countryside Agency focused on the economics of the local food industry, which of course is another important aspect and something that we are very keen to develop and promote.	2003-05-15.451.3	"I am sure that the Minister is well aware of the Countryside Agency report on local food, in which it says:
""the erosion of the infrastructure that used to support local food markets was identified as a key barrier. In particular, the closure of local abattoirs, due to increasing legislation"".
Under the heading ""Legislation"", it says:
""Regulations were felt to have a disproportionately high impact on businesses in the local food sector, which tend to be small/micro businesses. Much legislation is felt to be impractical, inappropriate, and unduly expensive to implement, particularly in the meat sector.""

2003-05-15.5.4	The hon Gentleman should be more reasonable in his approach. I have not tried to gloss over anything—I have made it very clear that very difficult issues face those in this industry—but it is equally unreasonable and unhelpful to try to suggest that closures are always associated with a particular set of regulations.	2003-05-15.452.0	The Minister has tried to gloss over the very worrying closure of small abattoirs and, in some strange way, to attribute that to commercial reasons. Of course he is quite right: those commercial decisions are taken because of the huge increase in costs to small abattoirs and the huge increase in regulation. Those commercial decisions are directly attributable to the Government. Will he now tell the House how he perceives the additional costs that result from the animal by-products regulations, which are about to come into effect? How many small abattoirs need to have their incinerators upgraded? How much extra will that cost; and what approaches has he made to the European Commission about allowing small abattoirs grants for the capital costs that will be incurred because of the animal by-products regulations?	2003-05-15.451.4	person/10240	person/10431	False	2003-05-15	blair	False	False	2	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Abattoirs	0	conservative	False	True	labourco-operative	False	False
2003-05-15.6.0	I can certainly tell my hon Friend that even at present the existing member states of the European Union export more to new members joining the European Union than vice versa. That is particularly the case with regard to high-value-added products and quality products. I certainly agree that this country has many excellent producers of food and drink of very high quality, which clearly gives us the market edge in the new member states. I anticipate that that will continue and I look forward to it doing so.	2003-05-15.452.7	I note that reply and I thank my right hon Friend for it very much. It indicates the enormous value to this country of our many excellent producers, who produce a wide range of food commodities that sell well in EU countries. As the EU will very shortly have 10 new member states, many of which produce food, many of us feel that we are under very unfair conditions. Can she assure the House that British producers, who have worked so hard to establish those markets in the EU, will not be squeezed out by unfair competition from new member states?	2003-05-15.452.6	person/10138	person/10031	True	2003-05-15	blair	False	False	0	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Food Exports	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

I am not aware of such exports being rebranded. If he has cause for concern in that respect, I would be grateful if he would let us know, as we will look into it.	2003-05-15.453.1	What proportion does meat on the hoof rather than on the hook represent of the food exported from this country?

2003-05-15.7.0	I am not aware of any evidence to suggest that agri-environment schemes are enforced more rigidly here than elsewhere in the European Union. Certainly, however, we believe that there should be parity, and that there should be proper enforcement, with the relevant requisite disciplines, right across the EU. Indeed, that is part of having a common agricultural policy. Equally, I am not conscious of a particular problem with regard to water whereby horticulturists are treated differently and worse than others. I will certainly look into the point that the hon Gentleman raises, however, as I assure him that it is no part of our approach to want to see UK producers disadvantaged.	2003-05-15.453.6	I am grateful for that answer. Does the Secretary of State agree that when there is a single regime, British farmers should have parity of treatment with others? If I may exemplify the point, my farmers are concerned that under the common agricultural policy review, agri-environment schemes may be enforced more rigidly in this country than in Europe. Secondly, my horticulturists are concerned that they must obtain licences for trickle irrigation while massive housing developments are allowed without regard to the need to extract more water to provide for those developments.	2003-05-15.453.5	person/11291	person/10031	True	2003-05-15	blair	False	False	0	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Farm Regulation	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2003-05-15.7.1	I entirely share my hon Friend's view that this is a matter of some considerable importance. Indeed, we are investigating now, in consultation with stakeholders, what kind of information would be most helpful to them and in what way we can best make it available. We would, of course, have to make the business case for the requisite systems to provide such information. I wholeheartedly assure him, however, that we are very mindful of how infuriating it is to be asked repeatedly by different groups of people for precisely the same information. That is exactly the kind of practice that we are trying to reduce.	2003-05-15.454.0	In discussion with farmers in my constituency last week, although they were not over-delighted by the number of regulations, they recognised that many of them are necessary. What they really felt needed to be addressed, however, was better co-ordination by the Department of the information provided, instead of having to fill in the same information on several different forms at a time. Will my right hon Friend assure me that, while recognising that regulations are necessary, she will look at improving the technology to ensure that farmers do not have to do as much paperwork?	2003-05-15.453.7	person/10500	person/10031	False	2003-05-15	blair	False	False	0	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Farm Regulation	0	labourco-operative	False	False	labour	True	False
2003-05-15.7.2	The hon Gentleman will know, I am sure, that the Government share his concern to an extent, and we did indeed make representations on that issue. I also agree that it is important to press the Commission to examine that potential further step speedily. However, the first step is to ensure that the test is evaluated as quickly as possible. If it is successfully evaluated and it works in the way that is suggested, we can press for it to be taken into account, and I assure him that we shall do that.	2003-05-15.454.2	The Secretary of State will be aware that a regulation that is disadvantageous not only to British farmers but to European farmers is the temporary ban on the use of fish-meal in animal feed, which sets us against imports from outside the European Union. The reason for that ban was bovine spongiform encephalopathy and testing. Is she aware that there is now a proven test, using microscopic analysis, that has been submitted to the EU and which can distinguish between fish meal and mammalian protein, which means that the temporary ban should no longer exist? Will she make representations to the EU to get the ban lifted as soon as possible so that our producers may use that excellent protein?	2003-05-15.454.1	person/10470	person/10031	False	2003-05-15	blair	False	False	0	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Farm Regulation	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2003-05-15.7.3	I think that there is a misunderstanding. The new national collection scheme is not a necessary prerequisite of the regulations' implementation. We urge farmers to sign up to the new national collection scheme because its purpose and effect is to lower the costs of implementation. We anticipate and hope—although we must always be cautious about making assumptions about how the House operates—that the regulations will be in place by the end of the month. Most farmers are clear about where they stand, although they may or may not like it.	2003-05-15.455.0	On the animal by-products regulations, will the right hon Lady confirm that we are now in the absurd situation in which the European ban on burying fallen stock came into force at the beginning at the month, but no implementing legislation has been introduced in the House to give effect to the ban or to provide for penalties for breaching it? Ministers are whispering behind their hands that everything will be enforced with a light touch for three months or so, but several local councils have already announced a strict enforcement policy. Farmers and councils alike deserve to know exactly where they stand, so surely the right policy would be for the right hon Lady to announce a delay on enforcing the ban until the new national collection scheme is in place and operating.	2003-05-15.454.3	person/10361	person/10031	False	2003-05-15	blair	False	False	0	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Farm Regulation	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2003-05-15.8.0	"At least we do not act dirty, which the previous Government sometimes did.
The hon Gentleman misunderstands. I made it perfectly clear that the reason why we could not support the Home Energy Conservation Bill, although we certainly supported the overall targets, was that under the modernisation procedures through which we will finance the further burdens that we require of local authorities, which we have rightly instituted, the cost of the Bill would have been about £400 million. Following the spending review, such expenditure was not available. However, it is true that home energy conservation targets are increasing steadily and gradually.
On the hon Gentleman's second point about kerbside recycling, I remind him that the current level is about 51 per cent. according to the latest information available to me. We believe that if we get to a national recycling rate of 25 per cent. by 2005–06, and we have every intention of ensuring that that happens, the level of kerbside recycling will have to be increased substantially by local authorities. If we were to require them to do it, we would again have to pay substantial sums of money—perhaps as much as £200 million—which is simply not available in the spending review."	2003-05-15.455.5	"I welcome the Minister's support for recycling but I would like to test what it actually means in practice. The Government attempted to remove all meaningful targets from the Home Energy Conservation Bill during its passage, although they were defeated in Committee by Conservative and Labour Members. They consequently destroyed the Bill on the Floor of the House. The current Municipal Waste Recycling Bill proposes recycling targets to be achieved by 2010 that would require, in the Minister's words,
""an increase in the level of kerbside collection in the order of 45 to 50 per cent."".—[ Official Report, Standing Committee B , 10 April 2003 ; c. 238.]
Do the Government intend to support those targets or will there be yet another example of when new Labour talks dirty— [Laughter.] Sorry. Will there be yet another example of when new Labour talks green but acts dirty?"	2003-05-15.455.4	person/10531	person/10427	True	2003-05-15	blair	False	False	0	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Recycling	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2003-05-15.8.1	I think that is a helpful suggestion. In terms of national targets and national performance, what happens in the House is infinitesimal by comparison, but it sends an important message. If we are asking other people in all households to increase recycling and recovery markedly—not just of paper, but also of plastics, aluminium steel cans, bottles and so on—it is important that we do it ourselves. I shall certainly take the matter up with the House authorities.	2003-05-15.456.1	Will my right hon Friend join me in congratulating the House authorities for doing their bit to promote recycling by providing Members with a separate bin for recycling waste paper? Does he agree that that promotion could be taken a step further, perhaps by having central collection points for used plastic bottles or tin cans? That might be a logical way forward.	2003-05-15.456.0	person/10087	person/10427	False	2003-05-15	blair	False	False	0	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Recycling	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2003-05-15.8.2	"It is a bit of a cheek for the hon Gentleman to make a case for recycling levels when we inherited a recycling level of 6 per cent. in 1997. That has been doubled to 13 per cent. and we intend to double it again to 25 per cent. within the next two years.
It is also unfortunate that the hon Gentleman prepared his supplementary question without realising that I had answered it in my full response to the question asked by the hon Member for Mid-Bedfordshire (Mr. Sayeed) , which he would have known had he been listening. Since he obviously did not catch it, I said that we are in favour of a big increase in kerbside recycling. It is already 51 per cent. We believe that achieving 25 per cent. overall national recycling by 2005 will increase that substantially. If we are to require local authorities to do that, however, we have to finance it from central sources, and we simply do not have the capacity in our budget to do that."	2003-05-15.456.3	"The Minister is proud of his targets, but he must be aware that the Environmental Audit Committee described them as ""depressingly unambitious"". Does he agree with most hon Members that bottle banks and the like will never achieve reasonable recycling targets? That can only be done by kerbside recycling, something that the Prime Minister acknowledged when he memorably said:
""I want to see every local authority offering doorstep recycling"".
Does the Minister agree with his right hon Friend? Does he, too, want to see every local authority offering kerbside recycling? If so, can he prove that by supporting the private Member's Bill promoted by the hon Member for Lewisham, Deptford (Joan Ruddock) , which will shortly be in Committee?"	2003-05-15.456.2	person/10240	person/10427	False	2003-05-15	blair	False	False	0	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Recycling	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2003-05-15.9.0	I understand my hon Friend's point. He has been active on the matter and recently wrote to us on a number of suggestions. However, if properly maintained, cesspits and cesspit tanks are perfectly environmentally acceptable. I appreciate that there is a cost attached to that and that there is also an issue of rural development. We are happy to explore ways of dealing with the issue if there is a case to do so on cost benefit grounds as well as environmental grounds. One way to do that might be to consider the facility in the English rural development programme in relation to support for rural communities and infrastructure. I shall write to my hon Friend in more detail on that and am happy to explore the options. We accept that he raises important points.	2003-05-15.457.4	May I take issue with my hon Friend, because they simply do not? The only way for water companies to provide mains sewerage to those rural villages in my constituency that need it is to use section 101A of 1991 Act, which requires them to prove the case on environmental grounds, not regeneration and economic grounds. The Water Bill is just up the Corridor at the moment and it amends section 101A. Will my hon Friend please look at it and consider the minor amendments needed to make the changes so that we can give a real boost to those rural communities that need mains drainage?	2003-05-15.457.3	person/10347	person/10444	True	2003-05-15	blair	False	False	0	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Sewerage Provision	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2003-05-15.10.0	The latest figures show a very substantial increase in the recovery and recycling of wood packaging waste. It was reported at a rate of 57 per cent. in 2001. The latest figures for 2002 are 84 per cent. That shows a substantial uplift, so large that there have been suspicions of an inappropriate allocation and use of packaging waste recovery notes. That is what I have asked my Department to investigate. I accept my hon Friend's point about the slump in PRN prices. I have told the industry that under the EU packaging waste regulations, there will be a considerable increase in those targets, probably of the order of 60 to 65 per cent. by 2006–08. In the light of that, further investment needs to be made now in readiness to meet those higher targets. On that basis, I hope that PRN prices will begin to recover.	2003-05-15.458.0	As my right hon Friend knows, the price of packaging recovery notes for wood products slumped towards the end of last year and is quite low. There are another two issues facing wood recyclers: first, the subsidy offered by power generators for biofuels to use in power stations, where they can offer higher prices than board and wood products users. Secondly, there is the proposed removal of a packaging waste recovery target for wood products. We have heard today about the exploitation of forests in the far east. Is it not time that we did more to encourage wood products recycling, rather than allowing barriers to occur?	2003-05-15.457.8	person/10305	person/10427	True	2003-05-15	blair	False	False	0	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Packaging Waste Regulation	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2003-05-15.11.0	As the hon Gentleman knows, we are strong supporters of regional advisory councils. There is a great deal of activity going on in fishermen's organisations in relation to existing structures. We believe that for those councils to be effective, they should be driven from the bottom, rather than being imposed from the top. They must genuinely engage and involve the fishing industry. On industrial fishing, the hon Gentleman knows my views. We are speaking to the Danes and to the Commission about the potential impact of industrial fishing. We have made £1 million available for scientific involvement with the English fishing industry. One of the topics that we are discussing with the industry is how we can use some of that money to fund proper examination of the by-catch and the ecological impact of industrial fishing, to strengthen the argument about its impact and to consider taking action on it.	2003-05-15.458.5	With regard to the cod recovery programme, which I presume would be an essential part of that, does the Minister agree that it will be meaningless as long as we allow the industrial fishing fleet to remove an important part of the food chain? Will he use the next Fisheries Council to instil some urgency in the EU Commission with regard to the setting up of regional advisory councils?	2003-05-15.458.4	person/10785	person/10444	True	2003-05-15	blair	False	False	0	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Fisheries Council	0	liberal-democrat	False	False	labour	True	False
2003-05-15.11.1	I understand my hon Friend's point. He has been entirely consistent and made a powerful argument on these issues. We had to fight hard for the regional advisory councils to be part of the reformed common fisheries policy. There were people in this country who said that we would never succeed and never get that. We did get it, and as far as we concerned, we see it as a framework for development. It is inevitable that we will have to progress step by step in the beginning to build up confidence and establish the influence of the councils. In the UK, we want them to have real power and a proper decision-making process, and to give fishermen a voice and an involvement in the management of their own fisheries.	2003-05-15.459.0	Accepting that my hon Friend always puts up a good fight, and a very cunning fight, on behalf of the British fishing industry, and does his best to voice the demands of the industry in the Council, I hope that he will attempt at the next Council and succeeding Councils to put more muscle into the regional advisory councils. National management of the waters has been a longstanding demand of the industry, and the present framework is purely advisory and has no real influence and role. It needs to have a defined role in management of the waters that it covers, so that they can be removed from the general considerations of management from Brussels.	2003-05-15.458.6	person/10436	person/10444	False	2003-05-15	blair	False	False	0	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Environment, Food And Rural Affairs	Fisheries Council	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2013-12-02.0.0	Again, I am happy to tell my hon Friend that crime is down on both the reported measures of recorded crime and the crime survey.

In future, the IPCC, rather than the police themselves, will investigate serious and sensitive complaints against the police.

To answer the hon Gentleman’s point seriously, the Government have been clear that if people want to come here to work and contribute, as Romanians and Bulgarians have done since 2007, that is absolutely fine. The changes we made last week are about ensuring that people do not come here to claim benefits. It is also worth noting that 79% of the new jobs created since the Government came to power have gone to British citizens.	2013-12-02a.610.4	Three million Bulgarians have left their country to work in other countries over the last few years, because they have had the right to access 15 European countries. Is not a lot of the rhetoric that we have heard recently just scaremongering, following on from the disgraceful situation in the Eastleigh by-election? [Interruption.] I see a Member squinting; in that by-election, it was said that 3.1 million Bulgarians—more than half the population of Bulgaria—would be coming here in January next year. Why does the Minister not publish the actual number of Bulgarians who have come here to work in the past few years, so that we do not have this rhetoric running around the media?	2013-12-02a.610.3	person/10027	person/11588	False	2013-12-02	cameron	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Immigration: Romania And Bulgaria	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False
2013-12-02.5.4	My hon Friend makes a good point. It is why our right hon Friend the Prime Minister said last week that we very much want to look at free movement and how we negotiate future accession arrangements for large countries. He set out a range of things we might want to consider, other than just time limits—for example, relative income levels in countries—which I think would have great merit.	2013-12-02a.611.1	Although I welcome the measures that the Government have taken on benefits, which will have an effect, are not the concerns about immigration from Romania and Bulgaria really just the tip of a wider problem? With much of southern and eastern Europe still heading into recession, tolerance of the free movement of people is quite close to reaching its natural end.	2013-12-02a.611.0	person/10065	person/11588	False	2013-12-02	cameron	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Immigration: Romania And Bulgaria	0	conservative	True	False	conservative	True	False
2013-12-02.5.5	When the right hon Gentleman’s party was in power, net migration reached 2.1 million. I should also point out, to help the shadow Home Secretary, who was challenged on this yesterday by Andrew Neil, that most of that immigration was from countries outside the European Union. There was a large bar chart showing that on the television screen, but she denied what is reality.	2013-12-02a.611.3	The Minister did not really answer the question from the hon Member for Amber Valley (Nigel Mills) , so let me give him another go. Given that figures published last week show that net migration rose to 182,000, from 167,000, over the previous year, before the impact of any Romanian and Bulgarian immigration in January, does he think that the target, as set out in the Prime Minister’s solemn manifesto pledge, of having a net migration in the “tens of thousands,” to quote the hon Member for Amber Valley, by May 2015 will be met—yes or no?	2013-12-02a.611.2	person/10259	person/11588	False	2013-12-02	cameron	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Immigration: Romania And Bulgaria	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False
2013-12-02.6.0	"My hon Friend is spot on. A number of the changes we set out last week do exactly that. For example, we are limiting the period over which a jobseeker can keep claiming benefits to six months. Colleagues in the Department for Work and Pensions have strengthened the habitual residence test to ensure that it is tougher. We have also made sure that if people who come here
are not exercising treaty rights and we remove them from the United Kingdom, we can stop them returning unless they demonstrate that they are going to do so."	2013-12-02a.611.8	A thought-provoking article on migration published last week by Civitas shows that the British sense of fairness dictates that there should be some link between what people put into the welfare state and what they get out of it. Does my hon Friend agree that in the case of new immigrants there is very little link at all, and does that not need to be looked at?	2013-12-02a.611.7	person/11291	person/11588	True	2013-12-02	cameron	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Access To Benefits	0	conservative	True	False	conservative	True	False
2013-12-02.6.1	On the hon Lady’s point about benefits, those are not decisions for local authorities but for the Department for Work and Pensions, which trains its staff very carefully and gives them clear guidance. They are rolling out the new habitual residence test, which is robust and has a clear script with questions that people are asked. There will be further changes on access to housing benefit. We will make sure that where these decisions are for local authorities they are provided with clear guidance so that they can make the right decisions in the tougher regime.	2013-12-02a.612.1	Much of the detail on access to benefits is determined locally, and it is quite difficult, even after checking with the House of Commons Library or the website, to understand what some of the precise definitions mean. What steps has the Minister taken to ensure that local authorities and the various agencies interpret what he thinks is a toughening consistently across the country?	2013-12-02a.612.0	person/10577	person/11588	False	2013-12-02	cameron	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Access To Benefits	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False
2013-12-02.6.2	I may be missing something, but if people have Romanian or Bulgarian passports and are citizens of Romania or Bulgaria, they are entitled to come to Britain because those countries are members of the European Union. Indeed, they could come to Britain today; the transitional restrictions are only about whether they can come here to work. People with a Romanian or Bulgarian passports—citizens of those countries—are of course able to come to Britain today.	2013-12-02a.612.3	On 1 January , when the transitional controls on Romania and Bulgaria are lifted, will entry also be permitted to non-EU citizens who have Bulgarian or Romanian passports? If so, will the very large number of Moldovans who have Romanian passports be entitled to benefits, like Romanians and Bulgarians?	2013-12-02a.612.2	person/11661	person/11588	False	2013-12-02	cameron	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Access To Benefits	0	conservative	True	False	conservative	True	False
2013-12-02.6.3	It is very good, of course, that the hon Gentleman takes a very liberal approach; he will have been delighted, then, when his party was in power and had net migration of 2.1 million over its period in office, but I do not think that was the general view. On the availability of public services, it is exactly because of the pressures on school places and on access to GPs that the Government have reduced net migration by nearly a third since the election. We want to make sure that people who are coming here are doing so to contribute and to pay their way, and that that immigration is properly controlled.	2013-12-02a.612.5	My constituents are pretty accepting of migration and have been for very many years, and I have always been liberal about migration to our country, but what does worry them is not just the benefit position but whether we have enough school places and social housing. Do we have enough public services to meet the challenge of a fresh wave of immigration?	2013-12-02a.612.4	person/10534	person/11588	False	2013-12-02	cameron	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Access To Benefits	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False
2013-12-02.7.0	We have looked very carefully at this, and we are confident that the measures in the Immigration Bill, including the changes that clause 14 makes to article 8 to put it on a proper statutory basis, are robust. The Home Secretary has made it clear that at the election we will have to deal with the impact of the Human Rights Act 1998 and the convention. Indeed, that has been reinforced by comments from Lord Sumption, who pointed out that the Court is now engaged in judicial law-making, which is in constitutional terms remarkable, taking many contentious issues that should be questions for political debate and turning them into questions of law to be resolved by a tribunal. I could not agree with him more.	2013-12-02a.613.4	I am grateful to the Minister for tightening up the previous Government’s deportation regulations so that the scandalous waste of time it took to deport Hamza and Qatada can never happen again. Can he confirm that the proposals he has tabled are unlikely to be struck down by the European Court of Human Rights? If they might be, is he prepared to take action against the European convention on human rights first?	2013-12-02a.613.3	person/24747	person/11588	True	2013-12-02	cameron	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Deportation Appeals System	0	conservative	True	False	conservative	True	False
2013-12-02.8.0	"I agree that it is a serious problem, and that is why the Home Secretary and I have been working to deal with it. The six-point plan includes Her
Majesty’s inspectorate of constabulary looking specifically at police referrals to the CPS, reviewing the use of out-of-court disposals for these cases, and convening a national scrutiny panel to look at the trends in, for example, rape referral levels. We are taking these matters very seriously. As I said, I am meeting the DPP this week."	2013-12-02a.613.9	I thank the Minister for that answer. However, as we know from the crime survey, instances of domestic violence are increasing quite dramatically at the moment, and there has been a 13% fall in the number of cases referred to the CPS from the police since the election. Is a six-point plan really enough to tackle this serious problem?	2013-12-02a.613.8	person/24710	person/10022	True	2013-12-02	cameron	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Domestic Violence	0	labour	False	True	liberal-democrat	False	False
2013-12-02.8.1	I entirely agree with my hon Friend and welcome the action she has taken for a long time on these matters. The pilot schemes for both Clare’s law and the protection orders demonstrated that they were useful. They were well used in the pilot areas and make a difference in driving down the incidence of domestic violence.	2013-12-02a.614.1	I welcome the Government’s decision last week to introduce Clare’s law and, in parallel, domestic violence protection orders. Does the Minister agree that those two steps will do a great deal to protect women against domestic violence?	2013-12-02a.614.0	person/24821	person/10022	False	2013-12-02	cameron	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Domestic Violence	0	conservative	True	False	liberal-democrat	False	False
2013-12-02.8.2	I think the hon Gentleman is wrong on almost all counts. On the piece in this morning’s The Times , the hon Gentleman might want to know that crime recorded by north-west police has fallen by 17% since June 2010 and that West Yorkshire has seen a drop of 15% in the same period. We welcome the fact that we now have a system whereby people—and women in particular—have more confidence to come forward to report domestic violence. [ Interruption. ] I hope you can hear me above the hubble-bubble opposite, Mr Speaker. I hope the situation will lead in due course to an increase in the number of prosecutions and convictions. Given that the matters are now firmly in the public mind, as they should be, historical cases are also coming forward and they are pushing the figures up.	2013-12-02a.614.3	Referrals are going down, but reported cases of domestic violence are going up. Today’s The Times also reports leaked figures showing that other crimes, including burglary and street robbery, are going up. Does the Minister now regret the Government’s complacency and the way in which they have undermined crime prevention specialist units, neighbourhood police and domestic violence support services?	2013-12-02a.614.2	person/25170	person/10022	False	2013-12-02	cameron	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Domestic Violence	0	labour	False	True	liberal-democrat	False	False
2013-12-02.9.0	I can assure the hon Gentleman that we do not conduct random operations; we conduct intelligence-led operations, as did the previous Government, and they are very successful. The street operations we have conducted this year have led to the arrest of almost a third of those encountered. They are very successful in enforcing our immigration laws. We do not stop people at random; we are not empowered to do so by law and even if we were, we would not do so as a matter of policy. We stop people when we think there is intelligence to indicate that they are breaking our immigration laws, and I make no apology for that.	2013-12-02a.615.0	"That is a surprising answer, because a number of us have witnessed immigration officers at Metropolitan line and other tube stations around London stopping people and asking them for their immigration status. Will the Minister assure me that no immigration officer would ever stop anyone randomly in a public place, ask them for identity documents and then call in the police to assist them with their inquiries, when there
is no requirement to carry identity cards at any time in this country?

2013-12-02.10.0	"The hon Lady is absolutely right to point to the appalling figures for the number of women who lose their lives each week in this country at the hands of a partner or former partner. Sadly, that figure has not changed for many years. Regularly, for a number of years, about two women a week have lost their lives in that way.
I share the hon Lady’s concern about the figures showing the number of young people who think that abuse within a relationship is normal. That is something that we must change. It is why the Home Office will shortly relaunch our very successful “This is Abuse” national campaign, which shows young people what actions constitute abuse and helps them to understand that.
Early next year, Home Office Ministers will meet Ministers from the Department for Education and teaching unions to raise awareness among staff and pupils about risks linked to violence against women and girls. I am pleased to say that the Department for Education is providing funding to the PSHE Association to work with schools that are developing their personal, social, health and economic education curricula, which includes sex and relationships education."	2013-12-02a.616.0	Given that two women a week die at the hands of a partner or ex-partner and, alarmingly, that 50% of young men and 43% of young women feel it is acceptable for men to be aggressive towards their partners, the situation needs collective action.

2013-12-02.11.0	I think that it is important to underline to my hon and learned Friend the steps that are being taken. Last year, about £1 million was taken off human trafficking offenders by way of enforcement of confiscation orders. Equally, I am absolutely clear on the need for more action. That is why the new National Crime Agency has been tasked with making the tackling of modern slavery one of its priorities, and why we are introducing the modern slavery Bill to up prosecutions and up such enforcement action. Indeed, the Bill will include provision for a new commissioner to get a stronger operational response on the recovery of assets and on other prosecutions.	2013-12-02a.616.5	I am grateful to my hon Friend for that answer.

We are focusing on provisions that relate to enforcement by policing and law enforcement agencies, but we will clearly keep operational matters under review.	2013-12-02a.617.1	One of the poisonous sidelines in the deplorable trade of human trafficking is of course the existence of rogue and criminal gangmasters. Are the Government minded to support Labour’s call to extend the gangmasters licensing regime to cover sectors to which this devastating trade has now spread, because it has gone beyond its traditional areas into construction, social care and other sectors where these rogues and criminals reside?	2013-12-02a.617.0	person/11347	person/11640	False	2013-12-02	cameron	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Human Trafficking	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False

The National Crime Agency has a focus on looking internationally and co-ordinating its work with overseas law enforcement agencies, so ensuring that where there is evidence, those involved in these pernicious crimes will be brought to justice.	2013-12-02a.617.3	On the basis of figures about UK citizens receiving consular advice for alleged trafficking and the fact that very few seem to be brought to justice overseas, is the Minister giving proper attention and resources to ensuring that UK citizens who ply this evil trade abroad are properly brought to justice?	2013-12-02a.617.2	person/11573	person/11640	False	2013-12-02	cameron	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Human Trafficking	0	conservative	True	False	conservative	True	False

I think that those changes will be welcomed in the country."	2013-12-02a.617.8	I welcome the Minister’s answer, but will he assure me that the Government will remove people who are not here to work and prevent them from coming back, unless they have a very good, legitimate reason for doing so?	2013-12-02a.617.7	person/24828	person/11588	True	2013-12-02	cameron	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Immigration	0	conservative	True	False	conservative	True	False

Indeed, from what I think I heard an Opposition Member say, there is a political party in this country that thinks that all 29 million citizens of those two countries are going to arrive at Heathrow airport on 1 January . With that range of forecasts, it would not be wise to make any predictions.	2013-12-02a.618.3	Although I can understand, given the grotesque underestimate of the previous Government, my hon Friend’s reluctance to predict the number of Bulgarians and Romanians likely to come to this country, may I encourage him to give the public and local authorities some indication so that they can plan?

The independent reviewer of terrorism legislation stated:
“In terms of security, the TPIM regime continues to provide a high degree of protection against untriable and undeportable persons who are judged on substantial grounds to be dangerous terrorists,”.
The hon Lady talks about people coming off TPIMs as if no one had ever come off a control order.

As he said in response to an earlier question, there was a meeting at the Home Office between Ministers and the Director of Public Prosecutions a couple of months or so ago to look at the issue and find out where the problem lies. Historic incidents are now being reported— we have seen a number of reports of claims of crimes in relation to Operation Yewtree and others—but it is right that we look carefully to ascertain what the issue is. That is exactly what the Minister for Crime Prevention will be doing when he takes this matter forward with the incoming Director of Public Prosecutions later this week.	2013-12-02a.622.0	"I join the Home Secretary is sending our sympathy to those who have lost loved ones or been affected by the tragic helicopter crash in Glasgow.

The Home Secretary will be aware that before the election the number of prosecutions and convictions for rape, domestic violence and child abuse was going up year on year as a result of the bravery of victims and hard work by the police, Crown Prosecution Service, Government agencies and support workers. The police recognised today that the number of prosecutions and convictions for rape has fallen since the election, even though more crimes are being recorded. The number of cases being referred by the police to the courts has dropped by 33% since the election.

What we have seen among the police forces that have been piloting Clare’s law is a real understanding of the need to work closely with other organisations such as Women’s Aid to ensure that there is support for victims. I am pleased to say that the Government have ring-fenced £40 million for local support, including for independent domestic violence advocates, who often play a key role in such cases.	2013-12-02a.623.1	I welcome that fact that now, under Clare’s law, victims of serial perpetrators of domestic violence will be able to get disclosures from right across the country. The Home Secretary knows that victims are probably at their most vulnerable at the point of disclosure, so will she ensure that organisations such as Women’s Aid and domestic violence advisers have sufficient resources to be able to protect those victims at that point?	2013-12-02a.623.0	person/10048	person/10426	False	2013-12-02	cameron	False	True	0	Home Department	Home Department	Topical Questions	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False

In fact, under Labour twice as many people arrived from outside the European Union as arrived from within it. However, as I said earlier, the transitional controls under the accession treaties that Labour signed can last only until the end of the year, and eight other European countries are removing those controls. That is why we have announced changes to ensure that anyone who comes to this country comes to work and not to claim benefits.	2013-12-02a.624.3	After the wave of mass immigration under the previous Labour Government, my constituents believe that this country is full, and do not want to see unrestricted immigration from Romania, Bulgaria and, as it now turns out, up to one third of Moldova.

2000-06-26.0.0	I assure the hon Gentleman that the placing of the report in the Library was directly related to his question, which provided a good opportunity for publication. Some losses will of course be incurred. We must await the liquidator's report before we know how great they are, although we estimate that they will be quite a bit less than the hon Gentleman suggests. However, the immediate liability will lie with GCDC 2000 Ltd., the limited liability company set up by the CRE. We will have to wait and see whether any liability extends to the CRE. I do not anticipate that any funding will have to be made available by the Home Office for that. In July 1998, we made it clear that we would not put extra public funding into the project, and we stuck by that decision in February.	2000-06-26a.640.0	"I am grateful to the Minister for that statement, as I think it could be called, in reply to my

question. Call me cynical, but I suspect that the placing of the report in the Library may not be unconnected with the fact that I was due to ask this question today. We will consult with some care the report to which the Minister referred, but I hope that the hon Gentleman will answer one straightforward, factual question. Is it true, as one commissioner for racial equality claims, that the shambles over GCDC 2000 will cost the Government a total of £1 million—£600,000 of which will go to reimbursing the CRE, and £400,000 of which will be made up of Home Office expenses?

I gather that their report may be a few weeks, or even months, away.	2000-06-26a.640.2	The Minister will be aware that the problem and its associated irregularities have delayed this year's National Audit Office report on the CRE.

2000-06-26.0.2	I ensured that the hon Gentleman would receive a copy of the report before questions today, and I accept that that report discloses that there were failings, especially in GCDC 2000 Ltd., the company set up by the CRE. However, I do not think that that justifies a general attack on all the good work that the CRE has often done in the past. The hon Gentleman needs to be careful not to get involved in that. The CRE has protected its statutory independence from the Home Office and the Home Office has, to some extent, respected that over many years. However, we welcome Gurbux Singh's advice that in future there needs to be a closer working relationship between the Home Office and the CRE. In particular, the Home Office will want to be sure that it monitors carefully the financial issues in the CRE, and Gurbux Singh will be content with that, I know. We think that many issues will emerge from the report. However, many of the recommendations in Gurbux Singh's report have already been implemented or will be implemented, and they will address the issues that came out of GCDC.	2000-06-26a.641.0	"I thank the Minister for his courtesy in letting me have an early copy of Mr. Gurbux Singh's report. Would he not agree that it represents a devastating catalogue of incompetence and mismanagement in the CRE, its holding company and the Home Office? Will he confirm that, among other charges, Mr. Singh says that the original budget for the conference was over-optimistic, that its costings were never assessed independently, that the accounting officer was kept in the dark, and that the process for approving funding was not as independent as it could have been? Does the Minister accept that it is not adequate to say that no one is responsible and that responsibility for the mismanagement must be shared by everyone engaged in planning the congress? The Government are planning considerably to extend the CRE's powers to investigate and report on Government Departments and institutions. Is it not clear that the commission's management, working


methods and relationship with the Home Office must be thoroughly overhauled if Parliament and the public are to have confidence that those new powers will be exercised competently?"	2000-06-26a.640.3	person/10361	person/10461	False	2000-06-26	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Global Cultural Diversity Congress	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2000-06-26.1.0	I agree with my hon Friend that the new measures will be good for the police, business, consumers, families and local residents. We have had representations from magistrates and local authorities, and we will obviously take them into full and proper consideration. Magistrates will be involved in the process because the magistrates court will be the court of appeal for many of the issues and will also deal with matters relating to penalties which may need to be imposed on rogue landlords. So in those circumstances, they will retain a role. Local authorities have expressed some concern about costs, but the White Paper contains provision for the administrative costs that fall on local authorities to be met from fees.	2000-06-26a.641.5	I thank the Minister for his reply. I know that the Government's proposals are warmly welcomed by industry and by alcohol abuse organisations. However, what representations has he had from magistrates and local authorities? The magistrates bench in Coleford in Forest of Dean is particularly concerned about the issue, as the magistrates there do not believe that the local authority has the expertise to deal with the matter. Moreover, my local authority in Forest of Dean is concerned about the costs that it may incur should such a modernisation take place.	2000-06-26a.641.4	person/10466	person/10461	True	2000-06-26	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Licensing Laws	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2000-06-26.1.1	There was a Labour administration in Lichfield until very recently, and I am sure that it was responsible for anything good that has been done in Lichfield. Local residents need some say in the way in which the licensing scheme operates. After due consideration, we took the view that the best way of ensuring that local residents had a say was for their elected representatives to play a key part in making decisions. It would be regrettable if the hon Gentleman believed that local councillors in Lichfield or elsewhere were unqualified as elected representatives to make decisions affecting local people.	2000-06-26a.642.1	The Minister will know from living in the area that Lichfield is sensibly and efficiently run by a Conservative council. I have no hesitation in recommending that local authorities, when they are Conservative, should be in charge of licensing laws. However, does the Minister accept that dour, dank, possibly even corrupt, councils run by Labour may take the view that they do not want licensing laws to be extended? In those circumstances, at certain times of the evening, people will drift from those rather dour authorities into the happy, sunlit hidden uplands of areas such as Lichfield, which are sensibly run by a Conservative council.	2000-06-26a.642.0	person/10193	person/10461	False	2000-06-26	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Licensing Laws	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False

No doubt, many different organisations and individuals, including many hon Members, will wish to make representations on the subject, and we shall consider them all. As I said, magistrates will continue to have an important role in the administration of licensing law and, particularly, in imposing penalties and as part of the appeals process. They will still have a role, but we wanted to ensure that we brought local authorities into the process as well. My hon Friend's suggestion that local authorities and magistrates might work together is certainly well worth considering.	2000-06-26a.642.3	I thank my hon Friend for his response to that question. There must be a review of the licensing laws, for planning and other issues. Given the expertise and material that magistrates and magistrates clerks have obtained over a period of time, I consider that magistrates should be on the licensing committees. It would be wrong to ignore the expertise in the clerks' offices and on the magistrates bench. I appeal to my hon Friend to ensure that magistrates are included on the committees that will issue licenses following the change.	2000-06-26a.642.2	person/10460	person/10461	False	2000-06-26	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Licensing Laws	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2000-06-26.2.0	The only mixed message has come from the Opposition, who have appeared from the comments repeatedly made by those on their Front Bench not to want to have this important weapon against anti-social behaviour in place. The hon Gentleman asked why the orders have not been used more widely. They should have been used more widely; however, I thought that the hon Gentleman was going to stand up on behalf of his constituents in the Lancing area of Sussex whose lives had been made a misery by Mr. John Vyles and Mrs. Madeleine Vyles, both of whom are now the subject of anti-social behaviour orders.	2000-06-26a.643.2	I agree with the Home Secretary, but why does he think that anti-social behaviour orders have been used at the rate of barely one a week since they were introduced?

2000-06-26.2.1	"My right hon Friend is entirely right. There is no question but that, as the police themselves report, in many instances the mere threat of an anti-social behaviour order has been sufficient to ensure that the behaviour concerned has moderated. My right hon Friend will recall that we proposed the introduction of such orders in one criminal justice measure after another and that in each case we were told that it was neither necessary nor practical to have the orders in place—notwithstanding the fact that

there were such serious problems of anti-social behaviour across the country and that the level of crime had doubled under the Conservatives."	2000-06-26a.643.4	Will my right hon Friend cast his mind back over the 18 years in which the Conservative party sent out the message that it did not matter what people did—that they could be as unpleasant and anti-social as they wished in the community and nothing very much would happen? Does my right hon Friend not agree that it is right to use the orders to prevent anti-social behaviour and that the test should not be the number of orders, but the safety of the general public? Where a message has gone out from courageous local authorities working with the police—in Coventry, for example—the level of anti-social behaviour has gone down.	2000-06-26a.643.3	person/10431	person/10574	False	2000-06-26	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Anti-Social Behaviour Orders	0	labourco-operative	False	False	labour	True	False
2000-06-26.2.2	I am always delighted to have constructive discussions with any right hon or hon Member of the House about their ideas for better reducing crime and disorder. As for the crime figures, as the House knows, recorded crime overall appears to be likely to have risen somewhat from March last year to March this year, and violent crime to have risen by rather more. The House knows that robbery, particularly in London, has increased, and we discussed that on Friday during the debate on the Metropolitan police service. However, what is striking about the figures are the significant variations in the performance of otherwise similar police forces and in otherwise similar areas. Although the Lancashire, Northumbria and Kent forces have no more resources than other forces, they all show significant reductions in crime, while in other areas there have been increases. As well as getting on top of the long-term trend in crime, we must take the lessons from those forces and areas within forces that perform well, and ensure that they are translated across the country.	2000-06-26a.644.1	Given that the Government were elected to be tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime and despite the best efforts of the Home Secretary—anti-social behaviour orders are part of a panoply of response—it appears that the overall crime figures are going up again and that violent crime figures are going up again. It appears from a ministerial answer given on Friday that the clear-up rate is less than 30 per cent. on average across the country, so does the right hon Gentleman accept that, instead of looking for simplistic short-term solutions, it is appropriate for all the parties in the House representing England and Wales to try to get our heads together round two questions? The first is how we can prevent crime more effectively and the second is how we can ensure that there are convictions and that people are dealt with when crime is committed. Is the right hon Gentleman willing to initiate talks in the House so that there can be a collective effort to persuade the Chancellor of the Exchequer and other Ministers to deliver the goods and deliver the promise?	2000-06-26a.644.0	person/10298	person/10574	False	2000-06-26	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Anti-Social Behaviour Orders	0	liberal-democrat	False	False	labour	True	False

The kind of experience about which I learned during that visit, and visits to many other similar constituencies, made us determined to put in place tough measures to bear down on the anti-social behaviour that was ripping apart my hon Friend's area and many others. I am glad that we have put those measures in place. I noticed that the right hon Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe) did not mention the Conservatives' attitude to anti-social behaviour orders and did not say whether they would keep them going or, in the words of the Front-Bench spokesman, the hon Member for Surrey Heath (Mr. Hawkins), would tear them up, despite the fact that they are plainly working throughout the country.	2000-06-26a.646.2	I am sure that Northampton, which is examining anti-social behaviour orders, will welcome the new guidelines. Does my right hon Friend recall visiting Blackthorn estate with me before the election? It used to have a crime rate on a par with that of Toxteth and has serious anti-social behaviour problems. Is the Home Secretary aware that his Department funded the Caspar project to deal with anti-social behaviour? Will he join me in paying tribute to the council, residents, police and especially the schools, which have worked to identify the reasons for crime and fear of crime in the local community? Will he consider making a return visit to see the great progress that those groups have made?	2000-06-26a.646.1	person/10328	person/10574	False	2000-06-26	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Anti-Social Behaviour Orders	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2000-06-26.3.0	The hon Gentleman has plainly not read what I said on 10 February 2000. The consequence of our firm but fair approach to the hijacking in February is that just under half of all those who were on the aeroplane have now returned. It was always understood, and I made it clear to the House in my statement on 10 February, that some of those—as it turns out, about half—would be likely to apply for asylum, and those applications have to be processed. I took the exceptional measure of making the decisions about those applications personally in the first instance, and I made most of those decisions, but not all, very quickly. The applicants now have a right of appeal. If the hon Gentleman or his Front-Bench colleagues are suggesting that we should withdraw altogether from the 1951 refugee convention or give people no right of appeal, we ought to hear from them.	2000-06-26a.647.1	Is there not a certain contrast between, on the one hand, the forthright and determined statements that the Home Secretary made all those months ago about speedily ejecting those people and, on the other, the rather sorry answer that he has just given? Can there possibly be a clearer indication of the extent to which this country is seen as a soft touch for asylum seekers than the news in the Sunday papers that another group of Afghans is now planning to do the same thing?	2000-06-26a.647.0	person/10065	person/10574	True	2000-06-26	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Asylum Applications (Hijacked Afghan Airliner)	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2000-06-26.4.0	The hon Gentleman is talking absolute nonsense. He is right to say that the budget has increased; that reflects the number of applications. We said at the beginning that it was difficult to predict the amount that would be needed for asylum support because it depended on numbers. This Administration have removed more unsuccessful asylum seekers than the previous Administration. Why do we not give the immigration service some credit for that?	2000-06-26a.647.6	The IND 1999 report forecast a budget of £350 million, but we know that the outturn will be nearer £597 million—which is 71 per cent. Over—and, in the same year, more than 20,000 failed asylum seekers have absconded. Is that not a disaster and indicative of the failure of the Government's policy on immigration?	2000-06-26a.647.5	person/10582	person/10508	True	2000-06-26	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Immigration And Nationality Directorate	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2000-06-26.4.1	Yes, there are, and we will publish the new targets. I can tell my hon Friend, who takes a close interest in these matters, that decisions in straightforward cases are being made rapidly, but he will know, as will all hon Members, that more complex cases take considerably longer. The way to deal with that is to make sure, as we are doing, that the proper administrative procedures are in hand and that there are enough experienced caseworkers. Unlike the previous Administration, whose policies resulted in the voluntary redundancy of hundreds of experienced caseworkers, we are taking on more people.	2000-06-26a.648.0	"I am sure that my hon Friend recognises that delays in decision making can have serious consequences for the people concerned. Even in what should be routine cases, people are unable to travel or to prove their status because they do not have

documents. What specific targets are being set in IND for dealing with travel documents and applications for indefinite leave to remain?

We have only a small proportion of such inquiries, but the right hon Gentleman may be assured that if such cases arise, the most rigorous investigation takes place.	2000-06-26a.648.2	Is the hon Lady convinced that the immigration authorities are totally colour blind in routine cases? Is she aware of the difficulties experienced by Maori people in coming to the UK—difficulties which, one suspects, would not have arisen in the case of white citizens from New Zealand? Will she make sure that, in the work of the immigration authorities, we are as generous to people coming from countries such as New Zealand as those countries have been to UK citizens?	2000-06-26a.648.1	person/10635	person/10508	False	2000-06-26	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Immigration And Nationality Directorate	0	plaid-cymru	False	False	labour	True	False

Not only is it right to make the decisions as quickly as possible, but it reduces the distress of those involved in the process. We are speeding up the asylum and non-asylum decision-making process. A good example is Oakington reception centre, where we consider cases in about seven days.	2000-06-26a.648.4	Is it not the case that investment in making decisions quickly saves the Home Office money?

about further detention spaces for those at the end of the process. It is unpalatable but true that those whose claims are unsuccessful have to be removed at the end of the process, so they have to be detained. That is why we need an increase in that space. The hon Gentleman knows—I have met and corresponded with him—that I am certain that that is the way to proceed. The previous Administration sought to introduce such an increase, but did not do so."	2000-06-26a.648.6	Can the Minister explain why, although she is so reluctant to detain asylum seekers on arrival in the United Kingdom, her Department is now considering building asylum prisons for those whose cases have been determined and who ought to be deported immediately? Does she understand just how horrified my constituents are to learn that, in spite of representations, her officials are still trying to find sites in North Thanet to build asylum prisons for people who ought to be deported?	2000-06-26a.648.5	person/10217	person/10508	False	2000-06-26	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Immigration And Nationality Directorate	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False

In the context of that work, I undertake to consider her proposals to find out what we can do to assist in the matter.	2000-06-26a.649.3	I thank my hon Friend for that reply. I am delighted by the undoubted improvements that have occurred. May I ask her about the evidence and inquiry unit? She will be aware that when an entry clearance officer abroad asks the Home Office for a statement of the case, it comes from the evidence and inquiry unit, but often takes six months to arrive. Bearing in mind the fact that many applicants have already waited a year to get an interview, will she consider increasing the allocation of staff at the evidence and inquiry unit? I understand that six hard-working individuals cover the globe. Will she ensure that re-applicants are interviewed in less than a year, because the failure to do so is keeping many families apart in heartbreaking circumstances?	2000-06-26a.649.2	person/10341	person/10508	True	2000-06-26	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Immigration And Nationality Directorate	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

hon. Gentleman and the House that we shall deal with the cases of those who have made asylum claims as quickly as we possibly can."	2000-06-26a.649.5	The Minister will know that there are reports that many of the Kosovans who were given leave to remain have extended the time that they have been allowed to stay in the country. Doubtless, many of them will apply for asylum. I wonder how long it will take to process their cases simply because such people are kept in limbo while their cases are processed—often for a long time, which is grossly unfair. It is not a question of statistics; real people are involved and the longer they are kept in limbo, the greater the problems for them and everyone else.

Is he confident that, in both urban and rural areas, the Act will be implemented well by magistrates, the police and the probation service?

2000-06-26.6.1	I would require more details to answer that question. Home Office Ministers are pretty well apprised of the terms of the convention. We do our best to observe it, but I am glad to learn from the hon and learned Gentleman, who played quite a role in the passage of the Human Rights Bill, that there continues to be support for that important measure on the Conservative Benches; it was welcomed by Conservative Front Benchers on Third Reading.	2000-06-26a.650.6	Having been on a Judicial Studies Board course on the Human Rights Act, I can tell the House how good that course was. I have heard from magistrates in my area that they have much benefited from the course that they have been on. However, what concerns me is that Ministers seem to be woefully ignorant of the terms of the Act. Is the Home Office making arrangements for Ministers to attend courses, so that they can learn about their own legislation?	2000-06-26a.650.5	person/10221	person/10574	False	2000-06-26	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Human Rights Act 1998	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False

2000-06-26.6.3	I am glad to have that further reminder of the constructive role that the Conservative Opposition took in the passage of the Bill and of the way in which the then shadow Attorney-General, the right hon and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Sir N. Lyell), wished it well from the Opposition Front Bench and advised his colleagues not to vote against it—indeed, he advised them to support it on Third Reading. It is possible that the hon Member for Surrey Heath (Mr. Hawkins) has been going on and on about the cost of the measure. It is the first time that I have heard him raise it. I do not recall such matters being raised to any degree during the passage of the Bill. By definition, we cannot exactly predict the behaviour either of defendants or, more particularly, of the courts. However, there have certainly been no major revisions of the estimates that we previously made public.	2000-06-26a.651.2	Although the Home Secretary is right to say that there has been a lot of all-party support for the Act, what we have repeatedly questioned is whether the Government's estimates of the costs in taxpayers' money of the implementation of the Act are accurate. In the light of further indications that far more cases relying on the Act will be brought before the courts, have the Government massively increased their estimate of the costs in taxpayers' money of implementation?	2000-06-26a.651.1	person/10264	person/10574	False	2000-06-26	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Human Rights Act 1998	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False

We also do not accept the charge that e-commerce will be driven out of the country, although I emphasise that we have entered very close dialogue with the industry to try to ensure full agreement.

2000-06-26.7.1	I half agree with my hon Friend. He is right to identify the benefits to crime of the way in which the internet can operate and we need to contest it. Examples of his point are clear. In 1996–97, through using such surveillance, there were 1,200 arrests, and the seizure of drugs with a street value of more than £600 million and of more than 450 firearms. I only half agree with my hon Friend because although some people are motivated in the way that he described, some are partners in dialogue—I mentioned business in this context—who are worried about the process, and it is incumbent on us as a Government to work closely with them. I do not impugn their motives, although I impugn the motives of some of those who have made some of the arguments.	2000-06-26a.652.1	Does my hon Friend agree that people who oppose the Bill are playing right into the hands of some of the most evil criminals on this planet?

The third is to make more explicit in the Bill the fact that we are principally requiring plain text rather than any encryption key in order to get the data that we want, about which there has been some concern. A number of those points will arise during the third day's consideration of the Bill in Committee in the other place.	2000-06-26a.652.3	Given the worries about which the Minister has just spoken, and the increasing concerns of Members of both Houses of Parliament and ordinary, law-abiding citizens who use the internet, will he tell us what changes he intends to make to the Bill?	2000-06-26a.652.2	person/10024	person/10113	False	2000-06-26	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Regulation Of Investigatory Powers Bill	0	liberal-democrat	False	False	labour	True	False

It states, in paragraph 3: A central feature of the new … arrangements involves … dispersal … from London and the South East, and continues, in paragraph 5: Our policy is to disperse away from London and Kent. Does she appreciate that that will cause confusion and depression in places like Southend-on-Sea—which recently had the pleasure of a visit by her—which are in the south-east, but not in Kent?	2000-06-26a.653.2	person/10591	person/10508	False	2000-06-26	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Asylum Seekers (Housing)	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False

It recently entered into an agreement to provide accommodation on one hotel site in Leicester for 400 people, but the local authority was not informed at an early stage.

2000-06-26.9.0	My hon Friend makes an important point, which explains why the guidelines for the further rolling-round that we published in February emphasise, first, the need for joint bids from local authorities and local business, because there are significant economies of scale to be made, and secondly, the need to go for schemes on small shopping precincts outside the city centres, which have not always been economic. The guidelines on the web set out clearly how that can be achieved. I hope that my hon Friend's crime reduction partnership in the Wirral will produce proposals which meet that point and the points that he raised in his question.	2000-06-26a.654.4	My hon Friend will be aware that several CCTV schemes in the Wirral have been or are about to be approved and that such schemes are effective in reducing crime. However, there is a related issue of the trading environment: for example, in my constituency, the shopkeepers and licensees of New Ferry are collaborating to improve the trading environment in a small community shopping area; they believe that CCTV's effect on youth theft and vandalism, general crime and night-time disturbances would be such that local people's shopping facilities could be much improved. Does my hon Friend agree that, although the money made available so far is welcome, far more needs to be made available, so that areas such as New Ferry can tackle such issues?	2000-06-26a.654.3	person/10098	person/10113	True	2000-06-26	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Closed Circuit Television	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

anti-social behaviour orders and child curfew orders—[HON. MEMBERS: ""How many?] There have been very few. Those orders have been opposed down the line by the Opposition. We are doing our best, as my right hon Friend the Home Secretary described, to roll out the anti-social behaviour orders. CCTV is an effective weapon to help to ensure that young people in all areas of towns and cities behave in a social way. We intend to keep on funding that programme to a much greater extent than the Conservatives ever did."	2000-06-26a.654.6	CCTV cameras are quite effective against young vandals, but if the young vandals were not on the streets in the first place, that would be even more effective. How many child curfew orders have been issued since the Crime and Disorder Act 1998? If, as I suspect, the answer is none, how great has the impact of such orders been in keeping young vandals off the street? Is this a new example of zero tolerance, or perhaps of the third way? The first way is to do something, the second way is to do nothing, and the third way—the Government's way—is to do nothing but put a spin on it.	2000-06-26a.654.5	person/10352	person/10113	False	2000-06-26	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Closed Circuit Television	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False

On rurality, may I point out to the hon Lady that my right hon Friend announced 10 days or so ago an extra £15 million for rural forces in the current year to meet some of the costs associated with rural forces?

Does he share my concern that although the Government have agreed with North Yorkshire police to top-slice its budget, the rurality factor should be taken into account? It must be recognised that the new equipment cannot be shared in sparsely populated rural areas such as North Yorkshire. Is the Minister aware that 16 per cent. of North Yorkshire's operational budget is currently spent on retirement pensions, and that 50 per cent. of it goes on early retirement for police officers?

Does he accept that, notwithstanding the 103 funded officers for the future about whom he spoke, his announcement on Friday of the increased money for the Metropolitan police has produced the double whammy that people in Essex who want to be police officers will be drawn to the Met to serve because they will earn more money, and existing officers in the Essex constabulary will resign and move to the Met because the financial differentiation will be £6,000?	2000-06-26a.656.5	person/10079	person/10574	True	2000-06-26	blair	False	False	0	Home Department	Home Department	Police Manpower (Essex)	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False

I know that he and other Members of Parliament have taken a great interest in the redundancies, and we extend our sympathies to all those affected. Of course it is right that we need to move as quickly as possible, which is why the Government office and all the other agencies, including the Employment Service, are working hard. It is right that we move ahead with the plan, and we shall do so as soon as we practically can.	2002-02-06.843.10	I am sure that the Minister is aware that not even a borough such as Macclesfield, which currently has an unemployment rate of just 1.1 per cent.—and is brilliantly represented—can rest on its laurels. We must look to the future not least because of the tragic announcement of 993 redundancies on the periphery of the constituency by BAE Systems at Woodford. Does the hon Lady not accept that it is absolutely essential for the future prosperity and economic growth of my area that the regional planning guidance receives an early approval? The matter currently rests with a Minister in another place, Lord Falconer.	2002-02-06.843.9	person/10647	person/10508	True	2002-02-06	blair	True	False	0	Deputy Prime Minister	Deputy Prime Minister	North-West Regeneration	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False

In particular, will she ask the Government office of the north-west to give whatever support it can to Wigan council's exciting proposals for a new community sports complex and a new stadium and home for Leigh RMI and Leigh Centurions?	2002-02-06.844.0	person/10766	person/10508	False	2002-02-06	blair	True	False	0	Deputy Prime Minister	Deputy Prime Minister	North-West Regeneration	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False

I emphasise that smallpox has been eradicated and that good contingency plans are in place.

I shall certainly try to give the matter closer consideration.	2002-02-06.845.4	What preparation has been made for a major offshore incident that could result in a massive oil spill, similar to the Braer disaster or the Sea Empress disaster off the coast of Pembrokeshire? Both reports on those disasters recommended placing a statutory duty on local authorities to deal with offshore oil spillages, but that has still not been put in place.

2002-02-06.2.1	Many of those issues were highlighted in the rural White Paper, for which I had responsibility in my previous job. We thought that it was important to separate rural areas from urban areas and not to get the two mixed up. We made it clear that special programmes were needed, which we identified in the rural White Paper and which are being carried out by the Department. Many of my hon Friend's points are being attended to directly by the Department and the relevant Minister.	2002-02-06.846.2	The rural White Paper said that we need to have a vibrant living and working countryside and that to achieve that aim a range of essential services needs to be in place in rural areas. I am pleased to say that there are plans to open two new rural post offices in my constituency. Will my right hon Friend do everything he can to ensure that the work of all relevant Departments is co-ordinated so that our rural communities have those services?	2002-02-06.846.1	person/10482	person/10488	False	2002-02-06	blair	True	False	0	Deputy Prime Minister	Deputy Prime Minister	Rural Policy	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2002-02-06.2.2	The hon Gentleman makes a valid point; it is all the more valid after 18 years of a Tory Administration under whom we saw a doubling of poverty and a decline in bus transportation, the provision of schools and post offices in rural areas. That is why the social exclusion unit has been deliberately designed to look specifically at those problems, which we identify as existing as much in rural areas as they do in urban ones. Indeed, a specific study is under way on transport in rural areas because without an adequate transport system many people in those areas cannot get access to the services that they need. That is why we have increased considerably the amount of transport resources in rural areas, set against the decline that we saw in those 18 years.	2002-02-06.846.4	The Deputy Prime Minister said today and, indeed, in the past in response to written questions that lead responsibility for rural policy now rests with the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. He however, is, responsible for the work of the social exclusion unit. Does he recognise that there are serious problems of social exclusion in many rural areas?

2002-02-06.3.0	"I could not agree more with my hon Friend. The record of attainment of educational qualifications among young children in care is woeful, and we all need to take that very seriously. Looked-after children need our absolute commitment, which is why I am delighted that the social exclusion unit is pursuing the matter. I welcome my hon Friend's news.
Some good practice is on the way. For example, I recently visited Brighton and Hove council to talk to teachers, foster parents and looked-after children. The council's track record of designated teachers is very good."	2002-02-06.847.2	"I thank my hon Friend for that reply. The work of the social exclusion unit has been critical in sending a message to all local government departments that the record of educational attainment of looked-after children has been woeful. It is something for which we all have responsibility, particularly since we gather that 75 per cent. of young people leaving care do so without educational qualifications.
However, there is some good news. In the Medway towns in my constituency, two such young people have been the first to receive bursaries from the local authority to go to university, and there is one more to follow. That is the sort of thing that we want to see—young people who have been in care getting the same as other young people, rather than anything special. I hope that my hon Friend's Department will continue to monitor carefully the attainment of such young people, so that they get what they deserve, which is nothing less than others get."	2002-02-06.847.1	person/10533	person/10508	True	2002-02-06	blair	True	False	0	Deputy Prime Minister	Deputy Prime Minister	Children In Care	0	labour	True	False	labour	True	False
2002-02-06.3.1	The social exclusion unit takes on projects at the direction of the Prime Minister and under the direction of the Deputy Prime Minister. So far, it has had a tremendous success rate. A good example is the meeting of targets on reducing rough sleeping and on reducing teenage pregnancy. Those are extremely good developments. Of course, there are more projects on the way, such as that on transport which my right hon Friend the Deputy Prime Minister has already mentioned.	2002-02-06.847.4	What mechanisms are in place to assess the relative success of the social exclusion unit compared with its costs?	2002-02-06.847.3	person/11308	person/10508	False	2002-02-06	blair	True	False	0	Deputy Prime Minister	Deputy Prime Minister	Children In Care	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False
2002-02-06.4.0	I welcome the right hon Gentleman's recognition of the importance of the commission's findings on the future of farming.

Although the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Lord Macdonald, is in another place, I shall certainly ensure that he is made aware of the right hon Gentleman's questions and comments.	2002-02-06.848.0	I am sorry that the Minister cannot say that the duchy itself made a submission to the Curry commission, which has produced the most significant report on British food and farming for many years, and offers an important way forward. In the light of its findings and the worries of duchy tenants as they see, for example, investment in more housing and changes in land management arrangements for the estate, what investment will be made in duchy farms in Lancashire to unlock their potential?

We can look at a cap on numbers and we shall want to consult on those matters when any future civil service legislation is introduced.	2002-02-06.849.1	May I repeat my oft expressed view that the way to see off the Opposition's absurd fixation with special advisers is to move ahead, building on the code that we have already established; introduce the civil service legislation that we promised; set a cap on the number of special advisers; and define their relations with civil servants?

2002-02-06.5.3	That is an interesting question.

I tried to do a bit of research the other day and it seems that in their annual report and accounts, the Tories simply lump Short money with the rest of the income that they generate— [Interruption.]	2002-02-06.849.5	"In the light of the excellent fourth report of the Public Administration Committee, which was published last February, does my hon Friend intend to take any further action in that respect? In particular, he should take note of the fact that the report says that the official Opposition

our taxpayers' money—

2002-02-06.9.0	I do urge people not to pay attention to what is sometimes called Government advice. The Government are in fact giving advice on the basis of the advice given to them by independent experts.

No fewer than 90 countries around the world use the MMR vaccine, including every major industrialised country, and 500 million doses of the vaccine have been given since 1972. I say to people that the scaremongering—and it is scaremongering—about this vaccine is wrong. Often, such scaremongering does not matter, but in this case it does.

How does the Prime Minister explain that?"	2002-02-06.855.0	person/10334	person/10047	False	2002-02-06	blair	True	False	2	Prime Minister	Prime Minister	Engagements	0	liberal-democrat	False	False	labour	True	False
2002-02-06.9.4	My hon Friend is obviously right to say that this is a complex issue, although I hope that he would also acknowledge that those who conducted the original inquiry are wise and celebrated people as well, and experts in that particular area. Obviously, we have to study the report, and we shall do that. We shall study its complex technical detail and give a proper response in due course.	2002-02-06.856.1	"When my right hon Friend is preparing his in-flight reading for the next couple of days, would he care to take with him the report on the Chinook crash? I hope that he will look, in particular, at paragraph 174, in which Lord Jauncey and his colleagues unanimously come to the conclusion that
""the reviewing officers were not justified in finding that negligence on the part of the pilots caused the aircraft to crash.""
I realise that the primary response to that will be from the Ministry of Defence, but will the Prime Minister accept that many of us, who have sympathy with the Department in a variety of ways, feel that the Gordian knot of self-interest that surrounds the Department on this issue must be cut through? We look to my right hon Friend for a better, clearer and fairer understanding of a complex issue that has been dealt with by some of the most distinguished jurists in the other place.

2002-02-06.9.5	It would be right, surely, to point out that there have been 1.2 million extra jobs altogether since we came to office. It is correct to say that manufacturing has gone through a difficult time; of course it has. It has done so in many parts of the world, but I believe the best thing for manufacturing is low interest rates, low inflation and a stable economic environment, and that is what manufacturing has. If we were to go back to the policies that the hon Gentleman used to support under the Conservative Government, which caused massive manufacturing job losses and a huge cut in manufacturing output and investment, that would be the worst thing. Having said that, of course we are deeply disappointed at Mr. Dyson's decision, but that is a decision for his company.	2002-02-06.856.3	Is the Prime Minister aware that some 350 jobs had been lost in the town of Malmesbury before yesterday's devastating news of 820 redundancies as a result of James Dyson moving some of his business to the far east? The Prime Minister will understand that that is appalling news for a town of only 4,500 people. Nationally, 350,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost since the right hon Gentleman came to power, and manufacturing industry is now officially in recession. Will he accept personal responsibility for this, or will he seek to blame someone else?	2002-02-06.856.2	person/10240	person/10047	False	2002-02-06	blair	True	False	0	Prime Minister	Prime Minister	Engagements	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False

2002-02-06.9.7	"I really have to say to the hon Gentleman that the position that the Conservative party has adopted today is, in my view, totally irresponsible. Let me tell him why that is the case. The evidence that I have read out is evidence not just about the importance of the MMR vaccine but about the importance of having it in combination, rather than in separate jabs. Let me just say to the hon Gentleman that the evidence that that way is better comes from right round the world—not just this country. It comes from 90 different countries. [Interruption.] Can I say this to the Opposition? This is important, so let me at least give them the evidence, as that is what people are asking for.
Every single piece of independent research that has been done around the world has found that it is important to have the MMR jab in combination, not separately. Let me inform the House that, most recently, the major US conference, as reported in the American medical journal Pediatrics , said that
""the available evidence does not support the hypothesis that MMR vaccine causes autism or associated disorders.""
It went on:
""Separate administration of measles, mumps and rubella vaccines to children provides no benefit over administration of the combination MMR vaccine and would result in delayed or missed immunisations.""
Two further pieces of evidence are important. Between 1994 and 1999, for various reasons, Japan went for separate jabs, rather than the MMR combination. Over that time, when there were no deaths from measles in Britain, there were 85 in Japan. In addition, I point out to the hon Gentleman that when a previous Government had to face a similar issue in respect of whooping cough, as a result of pressure it was decided not to give the vaccine in the original form. As a result of that, the immunisation programme virtually collapsed. As a result of that, some 100 children died of whooping cough.
This is a serious issue and I simply say to Opposition Members: read the evidence. Incidentally, the press have continually said that we have failed to provide the evidence. The evidence is published on the Department of Health website and it is available for anybody to see. Any parent who writes to the Department of Health can have the evidence, so I urge all Members of the House to have a care as to what we say on this issue, because, genuinely, the safety of children is at risk."	2002-02-06.857.5	What the Prime Minister just said on the MMR vaccine deals with the world as he wishes it to be, not as it is. The fact is that tens of thousands of parents do not accept his assurances that the vaccine is safe, however good the medical evidence. Instead of calling them scaremongers, should he not give them the choice of three separate vaccinations on the NHS?	2002-02-06.857.4	person/11145	person/10047	False	2002-02-06	blair	True	False	0	Prime Minister	Prime Minister	Engagements	0	conservative	False	True	labour	True	False

Of course it is important to take care who we sell arms to, and we do. The desire of African nations is for the partnership for change in Africa—which covers a whole range of issues, including aid and trade, investment and governance—to be satisfactorily put together for the G8 summit in July, so that the developing and developed world can give Africa the chance that it needs.	2002-02-06.862.0	Is the Prime Minister aware that on the day of the Twin Towers disaster, there took place in this city an arms trade fair sponsored by the Ministry of Defence?

There is a very high correlation between illiteracy and the learning difficulties of prisoners in our jails. We need to address those issues if prisoners are to have a chance of not reoffending on release.	2011-12-13a.642.6	Does the Minister agree that literacy is a key part of any rehabilitation strategy? Will he update us on what the Government are doing to tackle poor literacy, not only to help the future employment opportunities of those convicted, but to increase the prospects for work within prisons to be meaningful and transformative?	2011-12-13a.642.5	person/24794	person/11377	False	2011-12-13	cameron	False	False	0	Justice	Justice	Rehabilitation	0	liberal-democrat	False	False	conservative	True	False

2011-12-13.5.1	We are trying to give the notion of prison clusters much greater prominence. The right hon Gentleman will have seen that the OLASS—Offender Learning and Skills Service—review presages a situation in which prison clusters would procure education and skills training, and that should reflect the prisoner journey. We want to have a prison estate that is not under the enormous pressure it is under now—due to the terrible situation we inherited—so that we can get prisoner journeys from local prisons through to resettlement prisons, while both getting support from offender management and delivering programmes.	2011-12-13a.643.6	What is the Minister doing to make sure that probation officers’ work with prisoners is not undermined by prisoners being moved from prison to prison for no very good reason or for entirely administrative reasons?	2011-12-13a.643.5	person/10034	person/10051	False	2011-12-13	cameron	False	False	0	Justice	Justice	Probation Services	0	liberal-democrat	False	False	conservative	True	False

The probation service supervises some of the most dangerous individuals in our community and uncertainty now grows in this service, too, as the Minister decides whether to privatise all probation functions or just some of them.

We are looking urgently at how to improve the efficiency of the system and how best to proceed if people fail to co-operate. It is always possible to proceed with a trial in the absence of the defendant, but only once the judge is satisfied that the interests of justice will not be prejudiced. There is no point in starting a trial only for it to have to be started a week or two later when it is challenged.	2011-12-13a.644.6	Delays to cases caused by defendants not appearing in court can be very distressing for victims.

Since the work was transferred to Bootle courts, the utilisation level of Bootle has increased from 49% to 68% for the month of October 2011.	2011-12-13a.645.6	In recognising the problem, does the Minister think that it will be made worse by the closure of magistrates courts in places such as Southport, and will he monitor the situation?	2011-12-13a.645.5	person/11174	person/10854	True	2011-12-13	cameron	False	False	0	Justice	Justice	Magistrates Court Trials (Merseyside)	0	liberal-democrat	False	False	conservative	True	False

Will the Minister explain how it accords with the narrow definition in the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill, which will exclude many women from the legal support that they need and will, I believe, put a number of them at serious risk?	2011-12-13a.646.2	person/24767	person/10854	True	2011-12-13	cameron	False	False	0	Justice	Justice	Legal Aid	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False

As a non-practising advocate, may I ask my hon Friend whether the changes will affect the number of women entering the profession, and whether it is likely that the early stages of legal aid cases will be replaced by mediation?	2011-12-13a.646.6	person/10389	person/10854	False	2011-12-13	cameron	False	False	0	Justice	Justice	Legal Aid	0	conservative	True	False	conservative	True	False

The main exception is legal aid in domestic violence cases, which we are anxious to retain.	2011-12-13a.647.2	"The press were, of course, briefed on the domestic violence review before the House was. It was clearly stated at the weekend that the Deputy Prime Minister would undertake it, but perhaps he cannot be found now, which is why the Home Office will be in charge.
If the purpose of the review is to broaden the ambit of what constitutes domestic violence, why are the Department and the Secretary of State narrowing not just the definition but the evidential criteria, so that whether a woman is supported by a GP or hospital doctor or by a refuge, she will no longer be able to obtain legal aid?"	2011-12-13a.647.1	person/11559	person/10854	False	2011-12-13	cameron	False	False	0	Justice	Justice	Legal Aid	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False

Luckily, the new administration in Bassetlaw council has dug up the stakes that were put in by the last Conservative administration, at huge cost to the taxpayer. Why are the Government not sorting out the abuse of a change in the regulations that was made in 2009?

2011-12-13.11.0	I agree with my hon Friend that this is an important area, because it is a particularly nasty element of crime when violence or something of that kind is provoked by hostility to a disabled person because of their disability. Sentencing guidelines already provide that this is an aggravating feature when someone is sentenced. Of course, if the Attorney-General uses his existing powers to appeal a lenient sentence, he can include cases where disability is a feature, for example, in an assault occasioning grievous bodily harm or something of that kind. But we are looking at the point again at the moment and I will bear my hon Friend’s comments in mind.	2011-12-13a.648.1	More work needs to be done to ensure that existing provisions allowing for longer sentences where offences are aggravated by disability hate are applied consistently. Would extending the Attorney-General’s powers of reference not help to establish greater consistency in sentencing?	2011-12-13a.648.0	person/24843	person/10115	True	2011-12-13	cameron	False	False	0	Justice	Justice	Disability Hate Crime	0	conservative	True	False	conservative	True	False
2011-12-13.11.1	That is an option. Of course, as I say, offences provoked by prejudice against disabled people are regarded as hate crimes and this is an aggravating feature in sentences, but we are examining the whole area. We have to make sure that we do not overcomplicate the sentencing, because if we keep thinking of things that make the most serious offences even more serious, we threaten the consistency that has been described. However, the right hon Gentleman makes an important point and we are reviewing this field in the light of the report we have received.	2011-12-13a.648.3	Will the Justice Secretary consider introducing offences on disability hate crime and other hate crime, including incitement, along the lines of the legislation which rightly exists on racially aggravated crime?	2011-12-13a.648.2	person/10116	person/10115	False	2011-12-13	cameron	False	False	0	Justice	Justice	Disability Hate Crime	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False
2011-12-13.11.2	I shall consider that point in the course of the work we are doing at the moment, but I do not want to encourage my hon Friend too far because overcomplicating this does not necessarily help. What is important is that sentences should be allowed to reflect, in the most appropriate and consistent way, the disgust that the ordinary public feel when a crime is motivated by prejudice against a disabled person. It does make a crime even more serious than it would otherwise be.	2011-12-13a.648.5	Will the Secretary of State examine the possibility of extending the concept of disability hate crime to include disability by association, thereby bringing the concept into line with the other measures in the Equality Act 2010? If he does not do that, cases such as that of Fiona Pilkington will not count as disability hate crime as she herself was not disabled.	2011-12-13a.648.4	person/24764	person/10115	False	2011-12-13	cameron	False	False	0	Justice	Justice	Disability Hate Crime	0	conservative	True	False	conservative	True	False
2011-12-13.11.3	The hon Gentleman is quite right to say that the intent of the offender makes for a particularly unpleasant version of whatever crime it is we are talking about. I will certainly consider the hon Gentleman’s points, just as I have said I will those made by other hon Members, in the course of seeing whether the law needs any further improvement, but I think that sentences do already reflect the fact that it is a serious aggravating feature of crime if prejudice against disabled people is involved.	2011-12-13a.649.0	"I agree with a lot of what the Secretary of State says, but not with his claim that this move would overcomplicate things. One single principle underpins all hate crime: the principle of intent. If that principle applies in respect
of one group, does it not apply in respect of other groups, for example, racial groups or the victims of homophobic crime?"	2011-12-13a.648.6	person/10143	person/10115	False	2011-12-13	cameron	False	False	0	Justice	Justice	Disability Hate Crime	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False

The judge, when he gives a sentence or a judgment, is a public official performing a public function; his words can be quoted, he will be reported and there is no real reason why he should not be filmed. The other people involved, I think, need to be protected because, otherwise the whole nature of the proceedings will be changed, some people will be intimidated and some people’s behaviour will be affected.	2011-12-13a.649.5	I am grateful to my right hon and learned Friend for both answers.

We are talking about the judgments and what is said as part of his official duties by the judge and, at this stage, I am not contemplating going any further.

One thing that really upsets victims is when the defence lawyer, having already admitted guilt on behalf of his client and going to mitigating circumstances, suddenly launches into a major attack on the victim of the crime, thereby, I believe, abusing privilege.

2011-12-13.13.0	I recognise the figure of 96,000 as the projected prison population that we inherited on coming into office. As the hon Gentleman will be aware, changes that this House has endorsed through the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill, which is now in another place, will have an effect on that. In the end, all these numbers are estimates because it is our job to incarcerate those sent into custody by the courts. We will continue to do that, despite the evident frustration of the Opposition that we appear to be managing it rather more satisfactorily than they did.	2011-12-13a.650.4	Under Labour, we saw 27,000 more places provided in prisons and a modernisation of the prison estate. According to the Department’s own figures, it looks as though the prison population will rise to somewhere around 95,000 over the next six years.

2011-12-13.13.1	I hope that my hon Friend will ultimately judge us on the effect we have both on crime and reoffending figures. When people are in the justice system, the effect on them should be when they leave it they are less likely to offend than when they came in.	2011-12-13a.650.6	May I tell the Minister not to be ashamed of sending more criminals to prison? In fact, my constituents will judge him on the basis that more criminals are sent to prison, not on more criminals being released from prison.	2011-12-13a.650.5	person/11816	person/10051	False	2011-12-13	cameron	False	False	0	Justice	Justice	Court Proceedings (Broadcasting)	0	conservative	True	False	conservative	True	False
2011-12-13.14.0	We certainly want to make more use of restorative disposals, which can be valuable. They give greater victim satisfaction when the victim consents, and they can reduce reoffending. We have plans to announce more in relation to our neighbourhood justice proposals, which we will say more about at the beginning of next year. There have been many expressions of interest in that. The goal of the criminal justice system should be to deal with offending when it has taken place. I disagree with the contention that we should be diverting offenders from the criminal justice system. We should be diverting people from crime.	2011-12-13a.651.2	I thank the Minister, but the issue is that the Government’s approaches to restorative justice for children are embedded in the youth justice system so they only deal with children once they are inside that system.

We are seeking to get the Court to concentrate on the most important cases which require some international jurisdiction to get rid of the huge arrears of cases clogging it up at the moment, most of which are inadmissible, and to make sure that the national courts and national Parliaments discharge their primary duty of delivering the convention.	2011-12-13a.653.3	Last month my right hon and learned Friend prioritised the reform of the European Court of Human Rights during our chairmanship of the Council of Europe.

We are maintaining capacity to meet whatever demand we face from the courts. What I said last time, from which the right hon
Gentleman took the slightest extract, was that we respond to the decisions of the courts, we respond to the level of crime, and at present we have managed—[Hon Members: “ Have the numbers gone up or down?”] They have gone up. It is possible that with the prolonged recession and the long period of youth unemployment, there will be an increase in acquisitive crime. If that is the experience that we have in this country, we are responding to that. The Prison Service is responding very well to it at the moment, though of course we have to adjust the capacity of the estate."	2011-12-13a.653.5	Perhaps the Justice Secretary will advise his right hon Friend the Foreign Secretary not to walk out of those talks while he is chairing them, if he does not get what he wants in the first few weeks. The Justice Secretary will be aware that the number of prison places is now just below 90,000. It has gone up over the past 18 months as a consequence of doubling up prisoners in prison cells and as the previous Government’s investment in capital programmes comes on stream. At the last Justice questions, the right hon and learned Gentleman refused to answer my simple question about whether he thought prisoner numbers would go up, go down or stay the same, which is crucial for planning. He said that anybody who tried to predict prisoner numbers was “an idiot”. May I ask him another simple question? Perhaps he will rest the bluster and answer the question. Can he inform the House whether he is making plans for the usable operational capacity to go up, go down or stay the same during this Parliament?	2011-12-13a.653.4	person/11878	person/10115	False	2011-12-13	cameron	False	True	2	Justice	Justice	Topical Questions	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False
2011-12-13.17.3	We propose to make changes to the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act in order to make some offences spent earlier and to ensure that those who really have put their convictions behind them are not inhibited in getting fresh employment by having to disclose them. That is, I know, a Liberal Democrat enthusiasm, and my noble Friend Lord McNally will introduce amendments to the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill, currently in the House of Lords, very shortly, setting out the details of what we propose.	2011-12-13a.654.3	I am sure that we all welcome efforts to help reformed offenders back into work so that they can make a positive contribution to society, but one major barrier will always be the perception that employers hold of offenders.

As part of the process, will he also look at reducing the number of professions that are exempt from the disclosure limits on sentences?	2011-12-13a.654.2	person/24946	person/10115	False	2011-12-13	cameron	False	True	0	Justice	Justice	Topical Questions	0	liberal-democrat	False	False	conservative	True	False

But there is no doubt: this Government will seek to abide by their full obligations under the convention on human rights.	2011-12-13a.655.1	The Justice Secretary will be aware that last Saturday was international human rights day.

2011-12-13.17.9	I think that we had both better take legal advice on whether such behaviour amounts to contempt of court, but one of the things we are addressing is how we can make community sentences more effective. They have to contain an element of genuine punishment in most cases, and also of course be rehabilitative, but such an example is very offensive to victims and to the general public. Community sentences as a whole, however, have a very good record of improving the reoffending rate and deterring some people from wanting to commit crime again.	2011-12-13a.656.0	"What action does the Justice Secretary intend to take against offenders who receive a community sentence
instead of a prison sentence and then use social media to boast that they have “got away with it”? I am thinking in particular of comments posted on Facebook yesterday by Ryan Girdlestone, who mocked the court within minutes of receiving a restraining order for his part in a vicious attack on my constituent, Bernard O’Donnell, a man in his 80th year.

That is why we are encouraging people to go to ACAS in all circumstances before they go to the tribunal. That is what we have been consulting on.	2011-12-13a.656.4	Earlier this year, I put down a parliamentary question about the situation regarding employment tribunals. I was told that information on the length of time was not held centrally. Subsequently, I have discovered that there is such information, but that it does not show what the Government intend to do, which is to extend the period in which a person has the right to apply to an employment tribunal.

The cost of that is around £1 billion but as yet no incremental business or economic case has been produced.

One of the reasons for developing a high-speed rail link is that we need to find a lot more capacity on the existing rail network, and one of the ways we do that is by providing the extra capacity that HS2 will give.	2016-01-28d.394.4	Will the Secretary of State give close consideration to how Middlewich railway station can be reopened to passengers? That would facilitate much increased use of the rail line right into Manchester from Crewe and relieve considerable congestion on the M6, which has the support not only of local residents, but of a number of surrounding Members of Parliament.	2016-01-28d.394.3	person/24857	person/10397	False	2016-01-28	cameron	False	False	0	Transport	Transport	High Speed 2	0	conservative	True	False	conservative	True	False

I hope that the northern parts of the United Kingdom will be served by HS2 straightaway.	2016-01-28d.394.6	I share the concerns of the hon Member for Warrington South (David Mowat) . Is not it poor that there are no plans for any HS2 rail service north of Manchester, particularly to Wigan? The 530,000 people in east Lancashire will be completely disconnected from phase 2 of HS2.

We are evaluating the project very carefully indeed, and we look very closely at anything the Public Accounts Committee tells us—of course, it always tells us in hindsight; never in advance.	2016-01-28d.395.1	This is one of the largest and most expensive Government projects on the table. Just before Christmas the Public Accounts Committee heard from the Secretary of State’s permanent secretary about the evaluation of High Speed 1, which was two years late and was therefore not included in the evaluation for the early stages of High Speed 2.

He has been very clear about the benefits it will bring not only to the north, but to the whole of the United Kingdom. To intimate that he is somehow against the scheme is wholly wrong. I said that I hoped to have the full scheme announced by the end of this year, but I left a bit of leeway in order to make announcements sooner if I possibly can, to alleviate the blight of certain areas affected, which might not be affected under the proposals now being worked on.	2016-01-28d.395.5	We welcome the decision to accelerate HS2’s construction to Crewe. However, the whole of phase 2 is crucial for the midlands and the north. We were told that Ministers would confirm the route by the end of 2014, but that target has now slipped by at least two years, prolonging blight for residents, creating uncertainty and scaring off investment. Does the Secretary of State agree that there must be no doubt about the Government’s commitment to phase 2? Does he further agree that were a Chancellor with a Cheshire constituency to terminate the route south of Manchester, that would be an abject betrayal of the northern powerhouse?	2016-01-28d.395.4	person/24774	person/10397	False	2016-01-28	cameron	False	False	0	Transport	Transport	High Speed 2	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False

It is important that we work with not only the plant in my hon Friend’s constituency, but the one on Teesside to ensure that the industry has a sustainable future. We must also look carefully at other knock-on effects that indirect land use change might have, as the decisions we make in Europe can affect habitats in south America or the far east, for example.	2016-01-28d.396.2	There has been a £400 million investment in the Vivergo Fuels plant in my constituency, supporting 4,000 jobs.

Without that, the levels of nitrous dioxide are causing permanent health damage to many people in this country. At Tinsley, the local authority in Sheffield has decided to move a school away from the motorway because of the levels of NO2, but residents are still living there.

The Nissan Leaf is a major product produced in the UK to contribute to this market.	2016-01-28d.396.6	I am glad that my hon Friend has mentioned electric vehicles, because Continental, which is a major player in research and development for electric car drivetrains, making them for many different manufacturers, is based in my constituency.

Good work needs to be done on new fuels, but there is a glaring omission within the Government’s work just now. Regardless of the current fuel position, there is a need to plan ahead. The Minister will know that Oslo airport has become the world’s first airport to offer sustainable jet biofuel to all airlines, and that Lufthansa Group, SAS and KLM have already signed agreements to buy it. Here, meanwhile, the aviation industry has raised concerns that the industry’s sustainable aviation agenda is not being supported by Government.

Yes, alternative fuels may have an important role to play, but more importantly— [ Interruption. ] More importantly, a market-based mechanism will allow other types of technology to be developed which can then be used to offset the emissions from aviation, which will always be dependent on liquid fuels. [ Interruption. ]	2016-01-28d.397.4	I really do need to press the Minister a bit further on this. Recently, British Airways postponed its GreenSky project to establish a facility to produce advanced biofuels for aviation here in the UK. While the issues involved in that are no doubt complex, will the Minister listen to the increasingly widespread warnings from those involved in aviation that inaction and lack of clear policy direction from the Government are holding back the development and use of renewable fuels in aviation, thereby missing opportunities to boost jobs and skills in these technologies and making it more difficult to meet our obligations on carbon and harmful emissions?	2016-01-28d.397.3	person/10076	person/11804	False	2016-01-28	cameron	False	False	0	Transport	Transport	Transport Fuels: Renewable Sources	1	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False

Interestingly, she does not mention Nicola Sturgeon’s own bullet train, the Glasgow-Edinburgh scheme, which she announced as infrastructure Minister in 2012. It appears that Scotland’s First Minister has now given her bullet train the bullet.	2016-01-28d.398.2	The Minister will recall that he was previously asked by my hon Friend the Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Alan Brown) about the potential for increased journey times north of Crewe to Scotland under the current proposals for HS2.

That will encourage local councils to improve the maintenance regime on their highways. I urge him to work with his council so that it can benefit from that scheme to the maximum.	2016-01-28d.398.7	I am grateful to the Minister for his answer. I am pleased that he has agreed to come to Shrewsbury soon to look at some congestion problems in the town.

Although that investment is welcome, the current plans show that both roads will be upgraded at the same time, which will create total chaos on our region’s road network and bring the north-east to a total standstill.

I know it was a very fruitful meeting with the Secretary of State, who has asked Highways England to take a close look at this matter.	2016-01-28d.400.0	I thank the Secretary of State for meeting me and my hon Friends the Members for Kingswood (Chris Skidmore), for Bath (Ben Howlett) and for Thornbury and Yate (Luke Hall) last week to discuss our campaign for a new junction 18A on the M4. What assessment can the Minister make about the likelihood of the proposed junction? It would support job creation, as well as ensure that reducing traffic congestion in our constituencies actually happens.	2016-01-28d.399.8	person/24716	person/11804	True	2016-01-28	cameron	False	False	0	Transport	Transport	Local Transport Projects	0	conservative	True	False	conservative	True	False
2016-01-28.5.1	Such decisions will certainly be made more quickly than they were under the previous Labour Government, who did not get round to investing in infrastructure in the way that we have committed to do.

Doncaster and Barnsley have put evidence in to the commission for the trans-Pennine tunnel link.

I suggest that the hon Gentleman gets in touch with the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, my hon Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Andrew Jones) —he has responsibility for roads—who will no doubt be very happy to meet him.	2016-01-28d.401.2	At the last Transport questions, I asked the Secretary of State if he could look into the issue of excess noise coming from the M60 motorway, which has been made worse as a result of the Denton pinch point scheme. Since then, I have met officers of Highways England on site with the residents. Highways England officers have basically told me that they will not do anything, because the noise affects only eight properties. Will the Minister please meet me to discuss this matter, and will he knock some common sense into Highways England, which, quite frankly, has given me a jobsworth’s answer.	2016-01-28d.401.1	person/11531	person/11804	False	2016-01-28	cameron	False	False	0	Transport	Transport	Local Transport Projects	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False

The Government have announced that overall flood spending in the next period will be £1.7 billion higher than it was in the previous period. Within the transport budget, about £900 million is dedicated to things like making sure that the banks and cuttings are safe—those things that are often the first to go when there is heavy flooding. Improving the resilience of the rail network and making sure that it is fit for a 21st century climate are at the heart of the record level of investment that this Government are putting into the railways.
[Official Report, 29 January 2016, Vol. 605, c. 3MC.]"	2016-01-28d.401.7	I share the Minister’s appreciation for the staff and for the patience of passengers, but I think the point is being missed. Because money has been taken away from routine maintenance and flood defences, there has been a massive effect on our local economy.

That bridge has been there for over 100 years and has never been so damaged by a weather event. It is a tribute to the engineering work that is being done that the bridge will be secured and back open by 1 March . We treat such links with incredible importance.	2016-01-28d.402.1	Pursuant to that answer, will the Minister clarify what discussions have taken place with colleagues at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Department of Energy and Climate Change to prepare rail links for the flood damage that is likely in the weeks and months ahead as a result of climate change?	2016-01-28d.402.0	person/13856	person/24915	False	2016-01-28	cameron	False	False	0	Transport	Transport	Rail Lines: Flooding	0	social-democratic-and-labour-party	False	False	conservative	True	False
2016-01-28.6.2	I pay tribute to my hon Friend the Member for Torbay (Kevin Foster) , who raised this question with the Prime Minister. The hon Lady really needs to sort out her facts. The Government spent £35 million on the Dawlish repair and opened the line in record time. We are spending over £400 million on transport investment in the south-west, unlike her party, which wanted to can two major roads. I am looking carefully— [ Interruption. ] Perhaps she would like to listen, rather than chunter. I am looking carefully at how we can fund this very small amount of money without in any way inhibiting the overall report that we are looking forward to seeing from this very important organisation in April.	2016-01-28d.402.3	"Two years ago, the Prime Minister stood on the ruins of the Dawlish sea wall and said:
“If money needs to be spent, it will be spent; if resources are required we will provide them”.
Now, we learn that Network Rail cannot even afford to fund a report on improving the south-west’s rail lines, putting millions of pounds of investment at risk. Yesterday, the Prime Minister could not say where that money would come from. I want to give the rail Minister a chance. Will she honour her right hon Friend’s commitment and fund that study?"	2016-01-28d.402.2	person/24774	person/24915	False	2016-01-28	cameron	False	False	0	Transport	Transport	Rail Lines: Flooding	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False
2016-01-28.7.0	We are seeing unprecedented growth in rail traffic and transport. Importantly, the Government have matched that by increasing the investment for Network Rail over the next control period. Some of the improvement that my hon Friend talks about needs to take place. I say to my hon Friends, however, that there will be disruption while some of this improvement is taking place. Sometimes that will be because of the train operating companies, but sometimes it will be because of the failure of previous Governments to invest properly in the railways and upgrade them.	2016-01-28d.403.1	Southern rail allegedly serves Fareham, Swanwick and Portchester stations in my constituency, but commuters are fed up with the cancellations and severe delays. I am glad that the Secretary of State acknowledges that the service is not good enough, but will he reassure me that the mainline west and coastway west routes will be considered as part of the future improvement plans? Will the franchise be withdrawn if no improvement is shown?	2016-01-28d.403.0	person/25272	person/10397	True	2016-01-28	cameron	False	False	0	Transport	Transport	Rail Franchising	0	conservative	True	False	conservative	True	False
2016-01-28.7.1	First and foremost, I would point out to the hon Gentleman the amount of money that is spent by Network Rail in purchasing steel from his constituency or thereabouts. That is an important movement in the right place. It would have been a bigger betrayal to the people of the north had we not said that we need new rolling stock to replace the Pacers. I am pleased that the Government will replace the Pacers. The very fact that our train builders in this country—Bombardier and Hitachi—are busy is because of the record investment the Government are putting into the railways.	2016-01-28d.403.3	There is unlikely to be much UK steel used in the train contract that has just been awarded to the Spanish. What can the Government do to use franchising and other measures to ensure that their new procurement guidelines, which are a big step in the right direction, begin to have some purchase to ensure that steel content is included in such contracts?	2016-01-28d.403.2	person/24798	person/10397	False	2016-01-28	cameron	False	False	0	Transport	Transport	Rail Franchising	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False

As I said last week in a transport debate, I hope he lasts longer than his predecessor— [ Interruption. ] I think there was somebody in between. The contract to which he refers did have a break clause for First, but it was negotiated by the Labour Government. Therefore, they caused that break and it was part of their contract.
I am pleased to be able to remind the hon Gentleman of the words of the right hon Member for Tooting (Sadiq Khan) , who I believe has an important role in the Labour party—I hope it is a very unsuccessful one in a few weeks’ time. He said:
“one reason we are able to invest record sums in our railway service is the revenues that the franchises bring in and the premiums that they pay”.—[ Official Report, 1 July 2009; Vol. 495, c. 430 .]
He said that when he was in a position of responsibility: that of Transport Minister."	2016-01-28d.404.1	In 2011, FirstGroup, which runs Great Western, avoided paying contractual premium payments to the Treasury by choosing not to take up its option of a three-year extension, but in January 2013, the Secretary of State abandoned the competition for a new franchise and simply agreed a renewal with First until 2015, and subsequently announced a second direct award running till 2019, thereby avoiding the inconvenience of a competitive bidding process.

May I say to the rail Ministers that they have challenged us to speak to the facts?

Specifically, will he go away and look at the issue of private vehicular bridges crossing rivers in Rossendale and Darwen? I understand that the householders and businesses are liable for them, but in a couple of places they collapsed causing flooding upstream that has caused millions of pounds of damage.

I would welcome his and others’ involvement in putting a more substantive business case before me.	2016-01-28d.411.1	In the light of the recent proposal to build a railway line from China to Europe with capacity for freight as well as passenger traffic, will Ministers consider what further rail investment is required to ensure that the regions and nations of Britain are effectively linked to the continent?	2016-01-28d.411.0	person/10288	person/24915	False	2016-01-28	cameron	False	True	0	Transport	Transport	Topical Questions	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False
2016-01-28.16.5	There is a reason why Gloucester has elected my hon Friend twice now, because unlike the last lot, he stands up for rail links to his constituency. He knows very well and has made the case many times that the rail link is important. The CrossCountry direct award consultation process is currently in operation. I am sure he will continue, along with the council, to make these very good representations.	2016-01-28d.411.3	As a result of changes shockingly agreed by the Labour Government of 2006, the rail Minister knows that only three out of 63 trains a day operated by CrossCountry on the so-called inter-city service actually stop at the city of Gloucester. Does she agree that a significant increase in the number of trains stopping at Gloucester is a vital part of any settlement to extend the CrossCountry franchise?	2016-01-28d.411.2	person/24921	person/24915	False	2016-01-28	cameron	False	True	0	Transport	Transport	Topical Questions	0	conservative	True	False	conservative	True	False

2016-01-28.16.7	My hon Friend should know that this franchise was last let in 2004 on a nil-growth exercise—quite the reverse of what we have done. What will happen with the new franchise is that we will see the complete removal of the outdated and unpopular Pacers by 2019; £400 million of investment in 281 brand-new air-conditioned carriages; more than 2,000 extra services provided each week, including around 400 on Sundays; space for an extra 31,000 passengers; and £45 million invested in stations. Yes, my hon Friend’s constituents will see a major improvement.	2016-01-28d.411.7	Will my right hon Friend tell us how, with Arriva having secured the new 10-year Northern rail franchise, this will help to improve and support the Government’s northern powerhouse strategy, and, more importantly, how it will help to improve rail services in Disley in the Macclesfield constituency?	2016-01-28d.411.6	person/24820	person/10397	False	2016-01-28	cameron	False	True	0	Transport	Transport	Topical Questions	0	conservative	True	False	conservative	True	False

2016-01-28.16.9	I have always made it clear that this regulation is not required to fix a problem in the UK because we already have a competitive port sector with competition between ports. The general approach adopted by Council addressed many of our concerns, particularly the competitive market exemption. What is interesting is that this week, while a number of amendments were passed in the European Parliament’s transport committee, the mandate to go forward into trialogues was not given. At the moment, the regulation has run into the deep sand, and I hope it will remain there.	2016-01-28d.412.3	Is the Secretary of State aware that, back in the 17th century, the port of King’s Lynn was the fourth largest in the country and has been thriving ever since? Now, however, it is under severe threat from a pernicious and job-destroying European port services regulation. What are the Secretary of State and his Ministers going to do to make the EU see sense and withdraw this unwanted regulation?	2016-01-28d.412.2	person/10726	person/11804	False	2016-01-28	cameron	False	True	0	Transport	Transport	Topical Questions	0	conservative	True	False	conservative	True	False

I shall be happy to obtain an update on the exact timing and write to her.	2016-01-28d.413.2	We are approaching the second anniversary of the private finance initiative to electrify the line from Hull to Selby.

2016-01-28.16.13	My hon Friend is absolutely right. Trains to London Bridge, and other Thameslink trains, are benefiting from a massive upgrade costing some £6.5 billion.

Since then we have had an ongoing presence in Sharm el-Sheikh, working with the Egyptians on the implementation of that plan, and I think that good progress is being made. I fully understand the importance to Egypt of the resumption of flights to destinations in the country.	2016-01-28d.413.8	Ten days ago a group of us visited Cairo, where everyone from the Prime Minister downwards impressed on us the devastating impact of the suspension of flights to Sharm el-Sheikh on the Egyptian economy.

It states, on page 26, that
“Crossrail 2 would move inner suburban services onto new tracks”,
thus improving those services. However, there is no plan to try to run this enhanced metro on the current rickety two-track system, which means further delays in train services from outer suburban stations.

2016-11-15.0.0	I congratulate the hon Gentleman on the interest that he takes in this subject. I know that he has a petition currently running in his local area. We do take very seriously the additional pressures placed on the NHS primarily by the winter weather but also by disease prevalence, particularly flu. We started winter planning for this coming winter early in the summer. We have regular updates, which I run, and I report to the Secretary of State on how those plans are going. I can assure him that we are taking as many steps as we can to ensure that we are on top of this issue this winter.	2016-11-15b.101.7	It is a national disgrace that so many people die needlessly in this country as a result of the cold each year—43,900 people died over the winter of 2014-15.

I am pleased to be able to tell him that the change in policy last year reduced the amount paid under the winter fuel payments by 70% compared with the previous year to those people living in the European economic area.	2016-11-15b.101.9	As part of the plans to reduce and prevent deaths during the winter, what changes have been made with regard to the winter fuel payments for those eligible residents living in the Mediterranean?	2016-11-15b.101.8	person/10079	person/11696	False	2016-11-15	may	False	False	0	Health	Health	Excess Winter Deaths	0	conservative	True	False	conservative	True	False

How many of those pharmacies  in Dudley will not be able to sustain that reduction in Government subsidy? We use community pharmacies to undertake flu vaccinations for which they will be paid.	2016-11-15b.102.1	One way of preventing excess winter deaths would be to ensure that people can go to their local pharmacy for advice, essential medicines and flu vaccines. Plans to cut pharmacy budgets will  hit Dudley hard, with just 1%—one out of Dudley’s 100 pharmacies—getting extra support, compared with 40% in places such as Chesham and Hampshire. Of the thousands of local residents who completed my survey, 97% said that they opposed these cuts.

That involves closer integration with social care professionals to encourage quicker discharges from the hospitals.	2016-11-15b.102.3	What can be done to reduce the effect of winter pressures on the bed state of our acute hospitals and thus reduce the awful phenomenon of bed blocking this winter?	2016-11-15b.102.2	person/11132	person/11696	False	2016-11-15	may	False	False	0	Health	Health	Excess Winter Deaths	0	conservative	True	False	conservative	True	False

He is correct that it is discussing with NHS Improvement the development of a business case for an urgent care hub, and this is being considered in the context of the wider sustainability and transformation plan. Mr Speaker, I accept your admonishment in respect of my answer to the previous question. Of course, one of the primary solutions to winter excess deaths is the flu vaccination programme.	2016-11-15b.103.1	Kettering general hospital would be better able to deal with winter pressures were it given permission to develop its urgent care hub.

It was a great privilege for me to visit it and see the work that they have done. My hon Friend is right—the next step is to integrate the work done in acute hospitals with what happens in the community and the social care system. That is why the open and transparent STP process is so important.	2016-11-15b.103.7	Does the Secretary of State agree that the sustainability and transformation plan for Norfolk and Waveney is a vital part of the Queen Elizabeth hospital’s future as it successfully moves out of special measures?

2016-11-15.1.1	Let me tell the hon Lady that what is different now is that we have a special measures regime. When Labour was in power, the problems were swept under the carpet and not dealt with. Now they are being dealt with because we want every NHS patient to have confidence that we will not have another Mid Staffs. That is why we are making very good progress. With respect to funding, may I respectfully tell her that had we followed her party’s spending plans, the NHS would have £1.3 billion less this year?	2016-11-15b.104.0	I do listen carefully to the Health Secretary and sometimes I end up wondering what planet he is living on. There are as many trusts in special measures now as there are trusts that have come out of special measures. Just because different people in different places are experiencing poor care does not make the overall picture any better. When will the right hon Gentleman accept that the overall amount of resource going into the system is simply inadequate if he wishes to provide high quality, timely care for all?	2016-11-15b.103.8	person/24953	person/11859	False	2016-11-15	may	False	False	0	Health	Health	Hospitals In Special Measures	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False

If he looks at the hospitals going into special measures, he will see that we are beginning to succeed in moving hospitals out of special measures, but because we have an independent inspection regime, sometimes other ones go in. That is how it should be. That is what works very well in the education sector and is beginning to work well in driving up standards in health care as well.
To go back to my answer to the hon Member for Lewisham East (Heidi Alexander) , £1.3 billion more  in the NHS this year compared with what would have been put into the NHS if Labour had won the last election means 30,000 nurses, 13,000 doctors or 200,000 hip replacements that we are able to do because of this Government’s funding of the NHS."	2016-11-15b.104.2	The Secretary of State will know that with depressing regularity the same hospitals come up on that list that he has just referred to. Sustainability and transformation plans provide the opportunity to address some of the unsustainable elements of local health economies, but only, as my hon Friend the Member for Lewisham East (Heidi Alexander) says, if the money is there. With the health service facing its tightest financial settlement in its history, these plans are just not deliverable.	2016-11-15b.104.1	person/10061	person/11859	False	2016-11-15	may	False	False	0	Health	Health	Hospitals In Special Measures	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False

I was incredibly impressed with the staff I met at Peterborough hospital—there was incredible commitment to patients and some fantastic work going on in the oncology and renal departments, which I visited. He is right: PFI was a disastrous mistake, saddling hospitals up and down the country with huge amounts of debt, which cannot now be put into front-line patient care. We are doing everything we can to sort that out and not repeat those mistakes.	2016-11-15b.105.1	I thank the Secretary of State for taking time last week to visit the Peterborough City hospital and to praise the magnificent staff there, who are labouring under a £35 million annual private finance initiative millstone.

What I would say to the hon Lady is that I am not someone who believes that the financial pressures that undoubtedly exist in the NHS and social care system threaten the fundamental model of the NHS. What they remind us all of is that what we need in this country is a strong economy that will allow us to continue funding the NHS and social care systems as we cope with the pressures of an elderly population. That, for me, is the most important challenge—the economic challenge that will allow us to fund the NHS.	2016-11-15b.105.5	Today I publish my first annual report as Chair of the Public Accounts Committee, in which I conclude that there is a sustainability crisis in the funding of the NHS. Surely the Secretary of State will agree—he has made some comments in the media that suggest he is becoming aware of this—that he will need to lobby the Chancellor for a better settlement in the autumn statement. Will he update the House on his negotiations?	2016-11-15b.105.4	person/11605	person/11859	False	2016-11-15	may	False	False	0	Health	Health	Healthcare Spending	0	labourco-operative	False	False	conservative	True	False
2016-11-15.2.4	As ever, my hon Friend speaks wisely. Thanks to this Government, health spending in England is up by 10.1% in cash terms—4.6% in real terms—since 2010. That is double the cash increase in Scotland and three times the cash increase in Wales. Other parties talk about funding the NHS, but Conservatives say that actions speak louder than words.	2016-11-15b.106.0	Will my right hon Friend confirm that, under his tenure as the Minister, there has been a real-terms increase in spending on the  NHS in England, unlike in Wales, where, over the last few years, we have seen real-terms cuts under the Labour party?	2016-11-15b.105.6	person/11719	person/11859	False	2016-11-15	may	False	False	0	Health	Health	Healthcare Spending	0	conservative	True	False	conservative	True	False
2016-11-15.2.5	I know that the hon Gentleman has only been shadow Health Secretary for a while, but may I ask him to cast his mind back to 2010, when the party that wanted to cut the NHS budget was not the Conservative party but Labour? In 2015, his party turned its back on the five year forward view and said it would increase funding not by £8 billion but by just £2.5 billion. It is not enough to found the NHS—you have got to fund it.	2016-11-15b.106.2	But we have seen public health budgets cut and social care budgets cut, and I can now tell the House that the maintenance budgets have been cut. In fact, the backlog of high-risk maintenance facing the NHS has soared by 69% in the past year. In London alone, the high-risk backlog has grown by £338 million; across the country the figure is nearly £5 billion. NHS finances are so stretched that even the most urgent repairs are being left undone. Is this what the Secretary of State meant when he said that he is giving the NHS the money it asked for?	2016-11-15b.106.1	person/25120	person/11859	False	2016-11-15	may	False	False	2	Health	Health	Healthcare Spending	1	labourco-operative	False	False	conservative	True	False
2016-11-15.3.0	There are eight cancer standards for waiting times and we are consistently meeting seven of them, as we did in September. The right hon Lady is right to say that the 62-day waiting time has been challenging, and that has an impact on bowel cancer and ovarian cancer. It is also true, though, that one-year, five-year and 10-year survival rates for bowel and ovarian cancer are improving significantly. However, we do need to go further. That is why all 96 recommendations of the Cancer Taskforce have been accepted—we are investing up to £300 million to make that happen—and there is going to be a new test whereby all patients will be either diagnosed or given the all-clear within 28 days.	2016-11-15b.107.4	Is it not the case that only skin cancer and breast cancer referrals are meeting that 62-day target? Is it not unsurprising that the survival rate over 10 years is 78% for breast cancer and 89% for skin cancer, whereas it is 35% for ovarian cancer and 57% for bowel cancer? How does the Minister feel about these excess deaths, and what is he going to do to ensure that people with these cancers are treated in time?	2016-11-15b.107.3	person/10402	person/24932	True	2016-11-15	may	False	False	0	Health	Health	Cancer Referral Times	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False

The voluntary sector, including the charity to which he refers, makes a big impact and I congratulate it.	2016-11-15b.107.6	I refer to my entry in the register.

She received outstanding treatment at the Rosemere centre in Preston. That is the centre that my constituents need to travel to for radiotherapy for all forms of cancer, but an average round trip to receive treatment takes about two hours. Does the Minister agree that that is not acceptable, and will he support the Rosemere centre in setting up a satellite unit at Kendal hospital, so that people in south Cumbria can get treatment quickly?	2016-11-15b.107.7	person/11923	person/24932	False	2016-11-15	may	False	False	0	Health	Health	Cancer Referral Times	0	liberal-democrat	False	False	conservative	True	False
2016-11-15.3.3	My hon Friend is right to say that one of the big issues with ovarian cancer—we talked about this earlier—is that early diagnosis does not happen as quickly as it should. It is true that the cervical cancer test could raise awareness of ovarian cancer. We are looking at the issue and will revert to the House.	2016-11-15b.108.1	Like the hon Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Tim Farron) , I lost my mother to ovarian cancer. One of the reasons is late diagnosis and it has been suggested that cervical smear results should state that it is not a test for ovarian cancer.

It will cut childhood obesity by one fifth in the next 10 years, and I am determined that we do not get lost in a debate about what it could or should have been, but instead get on with implementing it. Our children deserve no less.	2016-11-15b.109.1	Channel 4’s “Dispatches” programme has comprehensively demonstrated how the former Prime Minister’s obesity strategy was drastically watered down by the time of the final publication. Both Public Health England and the Health Committee agree that control of in-store promotions of unhealthy food is absolutely vital.

It is proof that doing so is possible and meets the expectations of many consumers.	2016-11-15b.109.5	May I draw the Minister’s attention to some excellent leadership from the private sector? Lucozade Ribena Suntory, which is based in my constituency, announced last week —rather buried in the news from the United States of America, I am afraid—that it was going to take 50% of sugar out of its soft drinks by reformulating all its new and existing products.

However, we have been clear that this is not the   final word; it is just the beginning of the conversation. I would welcome contributions from my hon Friend, who is a dogged campaigner on this issue.	2016-11-15b.109.7	Recent data from the national childhood measurement programme shows that obesity rates have risen for the second consecutive year.

It builds exercise into the average day of children in schools, and it is already making a great difference to childhood obesity levels.	2016-11-15b.110.2	person/11816	person/24842	False	2016-11-15	may	False	False	0	Health	Health	Childhood Obesity Strategy	0	conservative	True	False	conservative	True	False
2016-11-15.4.6	The hon Lady is right to say that the childhood obesity strategy is one of our key priorities for tackling health inequalities in the UK. Obesity prevalence for children living in the most deprived areas is double that for those living in the least deprived areas, and the gap continues to widen. That is exactly why we will press ahead with the plan, but, as she has said, this is just the beginning of the conversation and we will continue to fight obesity as a government priority.	2016-11-15b.110.5	Another target that “Dispatches” uncovered was to be scrapped was the target to halve childhood obesity by 2026. This was compounded by recent national childhood measurement data showing that obesity is on the rise and that obesity rates are more than double in deprived areas compared with more affluent ones. Instead of squandering this opportunity, the Government should be pushing ahead with a comprehensive and preventive strategy. Can the Minister explain, therefore, why this significant target was dropped from the Government’s plans to tackle childhood obesity?	2016-11-15b.110.4	person/11592	person/24842	False	2016-11-15	may	False	False	0	Health	Health	Childhood Obesity Strategy	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False

When the hon Lady has access to it, she will see that some of the statements she is making are just scaremongering. She mentioned the King’s Fund, so let me quote it:
“The King’s Fund continues to believe that STPs offer the best hope of delivering long term improvements to health and care services.”
That is what the King’s Fund says."	2016-11-15b.111.2	Yesterday, the King’s Fund rightly characterised what is euphemistically called the sustainability and transformation project as being planned in secret, behind the backs of patients and the public. In Merseyside and Wirral, we know from leaks that the Government are going to cut £1 billion from our local national health service, which, despite rising demand, will close hospitals, downgrade many accident and emergency departments and possibly leave the whole of Wirral without an acute hospital. Will the Minister now come clean and publish these plans in full, and will he undertake to visit Wirral so that my constituents in Wallasey  can come and have a word with him about his plans for their NHS?	2016-11-15b.111.1	person/10182	person/24932	True	2016-11-15	may	False	False	0	Health	Health	Sustainability And Transformation Plans	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False

If an STP does not include those things, it will have to continue to evolve until it does.	2016-11-15b.111.6	Despite reassurances, there are still concerns that mental health remains peripheral to STPs in many areas. Will the Minister provide some further reassurance, because unless the Government absolutely insist that mental health is central and that resources are focused on prevention in mental health, these plans will simply fail?	2016-11-15b.111.5	person/11032	person/24932	False	2016-11-15	may	False	False	0	Health	Health	Sustainability And Transformation Plans	0	liberal-democrat	False	False	conservative	True	False

That does not mean that every local authority has a veto on  its STP.	2016-11-15b.112.0	The mayor of Bedford, Dave Hodgson, and I have a common approach to the STP in Bedford—it is ably led by Pauline Philip, the  chief executive officer of Luton and Dunstable hospital—but he is frustrated that he is not being involved and that his voice is not being heard in the process. Will my hon Friend ensure, when he reviews all the STPs, that he gets a guarantee in every single case that the local authorities have bought into the plan, and, if not, that they will not proceed?	2016-11-15b.111.7	person/24787	person/24932	False	2016-11-15	may	False	False	0	Health	Health	Sustainability And Transformation Plans	0	conservative	True	False	conservative	True	False

“not go ahead if councils believe they have been marginalised.”
Given that seven councils in London and west Yorkshire have already rejected their STPs and, as we have heard, that council leaders from both main parties have expressed concerns about the Cheshire and Merseyside proposals, does the Minister have a plan B when it comes to rejected STPs?"	2016-11-15b.112.1	person/25378	person/24932	False	2016-11-15	may	False	False	0	Health	Health	Sustainability And Transformation Plans	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False
2016-11-15.7.0	The system is under pressure but we also know that the best way to achieve the best results is faster integration, and not just money. I will give the hon Gentleman an example. There is a massive disparity between councils. The best 10% of councils have 20 times fewer delayed transfers of care than the worst 10%. It is not just about money, as the budgets are not 20 times different. Indeed, many councils have been able to increase their budgets, including Middlesbrough.	2016-11-15b.112.7	The Care Quality Commission has commented that social care is on the verge of collapse. The Government have had six years of warnings in relation to this matter, yet they have cut £4 billion from the social care budget.

2016-11-15.7.1	My hon Friend is right that there was an inadequate CQC rating for that care home. It is therefore right that the care home must either improve or go out of business. That is what the CQC regulatory environment will ensure. She makes a point about the issue with the hospital in Paignton; that is out for consultation at the moment, and I would expect the local care situation to be part of that consultation.	2016-11-15b.113.1	The Minister is aware of the Health Committee’s concerns about the effect of underfunding of social care on the NHS. He may also be aware that there are particular concerns  in my area and in the constituency of my hon Friend the Member for Torbay (Kevin Foster) because of the recent Care Quality Commission rating of Mears Care as inadequate. Coming on the back of community hospital closures in Paignton, that gives grave concern to all our constituents.

The real point is that those local authorities that go furthest and fastest in integration, with trusted assessors, early discharge planning and discharge to assess, have the most success.	2016-11-15b.113.3	"The National Audit Office report “Discharging older patients from hospital” said that
“there are…far too many older people in hospitals who do not need to be there”.
Delayed discharges reached a record level in September. The Minister says that this is complex, but I can tell him that the main drivers for that increase were patients waiting for home care or for a nursing home place; those issues are both related to the underfunding of social care.

The social care budget in East Devon, an area of elderly people, and the rest of the county is already under severe pressure. That pressure will inevitably increase if community beds are closed.

We are aware that the system remains under pressure, and are putting efforts into identifying steps through the A&E improvement plan, with five specific measures to improve front-door streaming, back-door discharge and patient pathways through hospitals to improve that performance.	2016-11-15b.114.2	I thank the Minister for that answer, but the truth is it must do better and needs more support. In September, only 86% of patients were treated within the four hour target time in English A&E departments; by contrast, in Scotland it was 95%, for a record consecutive period.

2016-11-15.10.0	I listen with great interest to what the hon Lady says, but I gently remind her of two things. First, as the result of the generosity of the Barnett formula, Scotland receives £1,500 per capita more to spend on health than England. Secondly, the Auditor General for Scotland recently reported that NHS Scotland was failing to meet seven out of eight key targets, including waiting times for A&E.	2016-11-15b.115.0	The A&E target the Minister mentions is actually a measure of the entire acute system. Important in that is the flow  of patients from admission through treatment to discharge. In Scotland, delayed discharges have fallen 9% since health and social care were integrated. In England, they have gone up 30%. Does the Minister accept the need to fund social care properly to relieve the back pressure on A&E?	2016-11-15b.114.7	person/25318	person/11696	False	2016-11-15	may	False	False	2	Health	Health	Nhs England: A&E	0	scottish-national-party	False	False	conservative	True	False

Is it not the case that the Government have simply outsourced the hardest decisions on social care cuts to the hardest-pressed local authorities to ensure that councils get the blame, not the Government, and that ultimately it is the NHS that suffers?	2016-11-15b.116.0	person/25366	person/24932	True	2016-11-15	may	False	False	0	Health	Health	Local Authority Social Care Budgets	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False

Calderdale royal hospital was an early PFI and is halfway to paying off its liabilities. The present proposal, put forward by the local CCGs, for moving to a full outlined business case would involve an A&E trauma centre on a single site, but there would continue to be emergency care in Huddersfield 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and it would maintain the capability to assess and initiate treatment of all patients, if it were to proceed.	2016-11-15b.117.2	How can it be right that the disastrous private finance initiative deal at Calderdale is dictating that Huddersfield royal infirmary be bulldozed, leaving Huddersfield as the largest town in England without an A&E unit?	2016-11-15b.117.1	person/24887	person/11696	True	2016-11-15	may	False	False	0	Health	Health	Nhs England: A&E	1	conservative	True	False	conservative	True	False

We will look at that plan and do everything we can to help to make sure that it works out.	2016-11-15b.118.1	The South Yorkshire and Bassetlaw STP sets out some very positive ambitions, but it warns that there will be a financial shortfall for health and social care services in our area of £571 million by 2020-21. Those ambitions are unachievable unless the Government address the shortfall.

2016-11-15.16.1	I am happy to do that, and I would like to pass on my congratulations to Dr O’Toole, who obviously does a fantastic job for my hon Friend’s constituents. We are investing significantly in general practice, with a 14% increase in real terms over this Parliament and our ambition to provide an extra 5,000 doctors working in general practice. This will mean that the need for locums will become much less and we can have much more continuity of care for patients.	2016-11-15b.118.3	Will the Secretary of State join me in thanking Dr Ollie O’Toole of the Kirby Road surgery in Dunstable for representing all of the very best in a family doctor? Will he also explain what more we can do to encourage people to go into general practice rather than working for locum companies, which so many seem to want to do at the moment?	2016-11-15b.118.2	person/11216	person/11859	False	2016-11-15	may	False	True	0	Health	Health	Topical Questions	0	conservative	True	False	conservative	True	False
2016-11-15.16.2	The hon Lady is right that the current delivery of this contract by Capita is unacceptable. I have met NHS England and Capita regularly to make sure that rectification plans are in place. We are assured that these steps are now in place and that the programme will improve.	2016-11-15b.118.5	The Secretary of State and the Minister will be aware that Capita has wreaked havoc in GP surgeries across the land, placing extra pressures on already overstretched NHS staff, compromising patient safety and breaching confidentiality. Last week, I met a group of practice managers who told me that some patient records have been missing for months, while others have turned up apparently half-eaten by mice. Given that this contract was introduced to save the NHS money, will the Minister tell us how much it is costing to rectify the mess and what steps she is taking to compensate GPs for the expenses they have incurred as a result of ill-conceived and poorly implemented contracts?	2016-11-15b.118.4	person/25283	person/24842	False	2016-11-15	may	False	True	0	Health	Health	Topical Questions	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False

The outline business case is due to be discussed with NHS England in the coming weeks. In the meantime, we are looking at an interim solution for relieving pressure on A&E services in the area.	2016-11-15b.119.0	Across north Northamptonshire there is an enormous appetite for the new urgent care hub to be built at the site of  Kettering general hospital, relieving pressure on A&E and improving services for patients.

2016-11-15.16.4	The hon Gentleman is absolutely right that diabetes is a major health risk in the UK. That is why we have rolled out the first ever NHS diabetes prevention programme this year on 27 sites, covering nearly half of England and referring nearly 10,000 people. Next year, the second wave of the programme will reach a further 25% of the English population. The aim is for the NDPP to be rolled out across the whole of England by 2020 to support 100,000 people at risk of diabetes each year.	2016-11-15b.119.2	Diabetes is a big problem in my constituency, and the number of unnecessary lower limb amputations due to diabetes is on the rise. Will the Minister ask clinical commissioning groups to provide fully staffed community podiatry foot protection services to avoid amputations, keep people in work and make huge cost savings?	2016-11-15b.119.1	person/13934	person/24842	False	2016-11-15	may	False	True	0	Health	Health	Topical Questions	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False

That happens very well in some parts of the country, but not in others. I think all hon Members have a job to make sure that people behave responsibly in their constituencies.	2016-11-15b.119.4	Proper integration of adult social care and health services requires co-operation on both sides. Does the Secretary of State agree that it is really not acceptable that in a borough such as Bromley, the CCG top-sliced only 3.5% of its funding to go into the better care fund—nowhere near enough to make a difference to hard-pressed local services?	2016-11-15b.119.3	person/13736	person/11859	False	2016-11-15	may	False	True	0	Health	Health	Topical Questions	0	conservative	True	False	conservative	True	False
2016-11-15.16.6	The obesity plan is one of the most ambitious in the world. It will reduce obesity by a fifth by cutting the amount of sugar in our food, helping all children to engage in an hour of physical activity a day, and making it easier for families to make  healthy choices. We already have some of the toughest advertising rules in the world, and we have consulted Scotland closely on these arrangements.	2016-11-15b.119.6	Both Public Health England and Food Standards Scotland support restricted advertising of junk food to children, yet this was entirely omitted from the Government’s completely underwhelming obesity strategy. Given that we clearly cannot rely on the UK Government to take this forward, will the Secretary of State support the devolution of broadcasting powers to allow the Scottish Government to tackle the obesity crisis and its devastating impact on society?	2016-11-15b.119.5	person/25270	person/24842	False	2016-11-15	may	False	True	0	Health	Health	Topical Questions	0	scottish-national-party	False	False	conservative	True	False

2016-11-15.16.8	As I have made absolutely clear today, I am determined not to allow the House to get lost in a debate about what the plan could or should have been. Our children deserve more from us. We should not politicise this debate; we should get on with delivering the plan that we have before becoming involved in a lengthier conversation about what a long-term obesity programme should be.	2016-11-15b.120.3	Climbing obesity rates are expected to lead to increases in type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and the need for joint replacements, which will put even greater pressure on the NHS. Given such threats to health, does the Secretary of State really think that now is the time for timidity and sucking up to business?	2016-11-15b.120.2	person/25425	person/24842	False	2016-11-15	may	False	True	0	Health	Health	Topical Questions	0	scottish-national-party	False	False	conservative	True	False
2016-11-15.16.9	In 2016, the Government implemented a new formula for allocation, which means a better deal for underfunded areas such as Winsford. As my hon Friend has noted, however, the extra money is being phased in over a few years to prevent distortions. This year her local CCG received an increase of more than 3%, and the funding will continue to catch up as a result of the new mechanism.	2016-11-15b.120.5	General practices in Winsford are being underfunded by 3.6% in terms of the formula that should apply to them because of the slow rate of change, while nearby Merseyside practices are being overfunded by 5%. That is resulting in a £30 million loss to my local surgeries. Will the Minister commit himself to looking into it and introducing a quicker rate of change, so that local residents can benefit from the funds that they should be receiving?	2016-11-15b.120.4	person/25363	person/24932	False	2016-11-15	may	False	True	0	Health	Health	Topical Questions	0	conservative	True	False	conservative	True	False
2016-11-15.16.10	As I said earlier, local engagement with all stakeholders is necessary. The STP for Cheshire and Merseyside will be published tomorrow. It is essential  for local authorities to engage in it as it evolves, and it is essential for MPs to engage in it—as critical friends—to make the plans better.	2016-11-15b.120.7	The Minister rightly said that greater integration between health and social care was a prize worth striving for. Why do local government leaders on Merseyside feel that they have been excluded from discussions about the STP process? If we are to make progress, they need to be part of the solution.	2016-11-15b.120.6	person/10292	person/24932	False	2016-11-15	may	False	True	0	Health	Health	Topical Questions	0	labour	False	True	conservative	True	False
2016-11-15.16.11	I know that the British Lung Foundation has called for a taskforce on lung health.

2016-11-15.16.12	What I can tell the hon Lady—who, I know, rightly campaigns hard on mental health—is that we are treating 1,400 more people in our mental health services every day than we did in 2010, and we will be treating a million more people every year when we have implemented the taskforce report. We are investing more, and we are making good progress.	2016-11-15b.121.3	The number of nurses working in mental health has fallen by 15% since 2010, from 45,384 to 38,774.

2016-11-15.16.13	The arrangement my hon Friend describes is a special relationship whereby a GP agrees with a hospital consultant to prescribe complex drugs which are normally only hospital-prescribed. This is not part of the standard GP contract and they cannot be required to provide this service. On the specific issue raised, we have asked NHS England to determine whether there are alternatives and I will revert to my hon Friend on that.	2016-11-15b.121.5	Shared care allows GPs to provide complex prescriptions for drugs such as methotrexate, but in my constituency the Beacon surgery recently withdrew from those arrangements. Can the Secretary of State assure me that the Department will support not only patients who now face potentially longer round trips, but GPs themselves, so that they can continue to provide those vital services?	2016-11-15b.121.4	person/25395	person/24932	False	2016-11-15	may	False	True	0	Health	Health	Topical Questions	0	conservative	True	False	conservative	True	False

It may surprise the hon Gentleman to learn that I agree with him that it is misleading to consider the marginal cost of coal in international markets and to state that 80 million tonnes could be purchased at that price. If the Central Electricity Generating Board were to enter the market for that quantity of coal, the price would be bound to rise.	1987-12-14a.755.9	When the Secretary of State next meets the chairman, will he discuss the current comparison between the price of British and international coal? Will he take into account the present level of international stocks as they reflect the investment in 1973, after the oil crisis, and how that price reflects the current weakness of the dollar, which is causing great concern when compared with European currencies? Will he also consider the fact that if we turned to the international market, international prices would rise immediately as a result? Will the Secretary of State answer the question raised by the chairman of British Coal recently as to whether we are to close more pits against such an uncertain background?
