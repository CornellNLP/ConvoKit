====================

Computes Politeness Strategies features. 

Currently offering three strategy collections covering two languages:

* politeness_api: English politeness strategies described in `A computational approach to politeness with application to social factors <https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Politeness.html>`_ 
* politeness_local: English politeness strategies realized through local markers as used in `Facilitating the Communication of Politeness through Fine-Grained Paraphrasing <https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Politeness_Paraphrasing.html>`_ 
* politeness_cscw_zh: Chinese politeness strategies adapted from `Studying Politeness across Cultures using English Twitter and Mandarin Weibo <https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3415190>`_


Example usage:

* `extracting politeness features and markers <https://github.com/CornellNLP/Cornell-Conversational-Analysis-Toolkit/blob/master/examples/politeness-strategies/Politeness_Marker_and_Summarize_Demo.ipynb>`_, 
* `understanding the (mis)use of politeness strategies in conversations gone awry on Wikipedia <https://github.com/CornellNLP/Cornell-Conversational-Analysis-Toolkit/blob/master/examples/conversations-gone-awry/Conversations_Gone_Awry_Prediction.ipynb>`_,
* `assessing the permeability of politeness markers in machine-translated communication <https://github.com/CornellNLP/Cornell-Conversational-Analysis-Toolkit/blob/master/examples/politeness-strategies/Politeness_Strategies_in_MT-mediated_Communication.ipynb>`_
